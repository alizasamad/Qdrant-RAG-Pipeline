" What restoration rights do employees have when returning from uniformed service, and what are the key limitations on service duration?
"," According to §353.203, employees have restoration rights with the following key conditions:
1. Cumulative service in uniformed services while employed by the Federal Government cannot exceed 5 years
2. Certain types of service are excluded from the 5-year limit, such as:
   - Service required beyond 5 years to complete an initial obligated service period
   - Service during national emergencies
   - Service ordered for critical missions or operational requirements
   - Service for professional development or skill training

The policy emphasizes that employees have a dual obligation to both their military service and their civilian employer, and both parties are expected to make good-faith efforts to minimize conflicts.","['elect to be placed in a lesser position in the commuting area, or OPM will attempt to place the individual in an equivalent position in another geographic location determined by OPM. If the individual declines an offer of equivalent employ-ment, he or she has no further restora-tion rights. (b) Employee returning from compen- sable injury. OPM will provide place-ment assistance to an employee with restoration rights in the executive, leg- islative, or judicial branches who can-not be placed in his or her former agen-cy and who either has competitive sta-tus or is eligible to acquire it under 5 U.S.C. 3304(C). If the employee’s agency is abolished and its functions are not transferred, or it is not possible for the employee to be restored in his or her former agency, the employee is eligible for placement assistance under the Interagency Career Transition Assist-ance Plan (ICTAP) under part 330, sub-part G, of this chapter. This paragraph does not apply to an employee serving under a temporary appointment pend-ing establishment of a register (TAPER).

The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 revised and strengthened the existing Veterans’ Reemployment Rights law, made the Department of Labor respon-sible for investigating employee com-plaints, required OPM to place certain returning employees in other agencies, established a separate restoration rights program for employees of the in-telligence agencies, and altered the ap-peals rights process. The new law ap-plies to persons exercising restoration rights on or after December 12, 1994. § 353.202 Discrimination and acts of reprisal prohibited. A person who seeks or holds a posi- tion in the Executive branch may not be denied hiring, retention in employ-ment, or any other incident or advan-tage of employment because of any ap-plication, membership, or service in the uniformed services. Furthermore, an agency may not take any reprisal against an employee for taking any ac-tion to enforce a protection, assist or participate in an investigation, or exer-cise any right provided for under chap-ter 43 of title 38, United States Code.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 353.203 § 353.203 Length of service. (a) Counting service after the effective date of USERRA (12/12/94). To be enti- tled to restoration rights under this part, cumulative service in the uni-formed services while employed by the Federal Government may not exceed 5 years. However, the 5-year period does not include any service— (1) That is required beyond 5 years to complete an initial period of obligated service; (2) During which the individual was unable to obtain orders releasing him or her from service in the uniformed services before expiration of the 5-year period, and such inability was through no fault of the individual; (3) Performed as required pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 10147, under 32 U.S.C. 502(a) or 503, or to fulfill additional training re-quirements determined and certified in writing by the Secretary of the mili- tary department concerned to be nec-essary for professional development or for completion of skill training or re-training; (4) Performed by a member of a uni- formed service who is: (i) Ordered to or retained on active duty under sections 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, 12305, or 688 of title 10, United States Code, or under 14 U.S.C. 331, 332, 359, 360, 367, or 712; (ii) Ordered to or retained on active duty (other than for training) under any provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress, as de-termined by the Secretary concerned. (iii) Ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support, as deter-mined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, of an oper-ational mission for which personnel have been ordered to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 12304; (iv) Ordered to active duty in sup- port, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, of a critical mission or requirement of the uniformed services, or (v) Called into Federal service as a member of the National Guard under chapter 15 or under section 12406 of title 10, United States Code. (b) Counting service prior to the effec- tive date of USERRA. In determining the 5-year total that may not be ex-ceeded for purposes of exercising res- toration rights, service performed prior to December 12, 1994, is considered only to the extent that it would have count-ed under the previous law (the Vet-erans’ Reemployment Rights statute). For example, the service of a National Guard technician who entered on an Active Guard Reserve (AGR) tour under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, was not counted toward the 4-year time limit under the pre-vious statute because it was specifi-cally considered active duty for train-ing. However, title 32, section 502(f) AGR service is not exempt from the cu-mulative time limits allowed under USERRA and service after the effective date counts under USERRA rules. Thus, if a technician was on a 32 U.S.C. 502(f) AGR tour on October 13, 1994, (the date USERRA was signed into law), but exercised restoration rights after De-cember 11, 1994, (the date USERRA be-came fully effective), AGR service prior to December 12 would not count in computing the 5-year total, but all service beginning with that date would count. (c) Nature of Reserve service and resolv- ing conflicts. An employee who is a member of the Reserve or National Guard has a dual obligation—to the military and to his or her employer. Given the nature of the employee’s service obligation, some conflict with job demands is often unavoidable and a good-faith effort on the part of both the employee and the agency is needed to minimize conflict and resolve dif-ferences. Some accommodation may be necessary by both parties. Most Re-serve component members are re-quired, as a minimum, to participate in drills for 2 days each month and in 2 weeks of active duty for training per year. But some members are required to participate in longer or more fre-quent training tours. USERRA makes it clear that the timing, frequency, du-ration, and nature of the duty per-formed is not an issue so long as the employee gave proper notice, and did not exceed the time limits specified. However, to the extent that the em-ployee has influence upon the timing, frequency, or duration of such training or duty, he or she is expected to use that influence to minimize the burden VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May', 'in return for payment of an ex-tended assignment incentive.

An authorized agency official must review and approve the offer of an ex-tended assignment incentive for an em-ployee, including the amount of such incentive. The authorized agency offi-cial must be at a higher level than the official who made the initial decision to offer an extended assignment incen-tive, unless there is no official at a higher level in the agency. § 575.504 What requirements must an agency satisfy before authorizing the payment of an extended assign-ment incentive? Before paying an extended assign- ment incentive under this subpart, an agency must establish an extended as-signment incentive plan. This plan must include the following elements: (a) The designation of authorized agency officials who must review and approve the payment of extended as-signment incentives; (b) The categories of employees which are prohibited from receiving an extended assignment incentive; (c) The criteria that must be met or considered in authorizing extended as-signment incentives, including criteria for determining the size of an incen-tive; (d) The requirements governing serv- ice agreements, including the obliga-tions of the agency and the employee when the service period is not com-pleted; (e) The procedures for paying ex- tended assignment incentives; and (f) Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow recon-struction of the action. § 575.505 What criteria must an agency use to determine who will receive an extended assignment incentive? (a) An agency must base the payment of an extended assignment incentive on a written determination that— (1) The eligible employee has com- pleted at least 2 years of continuous service immediately before the com-mencement of the service agreement in one or more civil service positions lo-cated in a particular territory, posses-sion, or commonwealth; (2) It is in the best interest of the Government to encourage the em-ployee to complete a specified addi-tional period of employment with the agency in that location; and (3) Replacing the employee with an- other employee possessing the required qualifications and experience would be difficult. (b) In determining whether it is in the best interest of the Government to retain an employee under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an agency may consider how the employee’s departure would affect the agency’s ability to op-erate effectively or to carry out an ac-tivity or perform a function which the agency deems essential to its mission.

However, an agency may consider common factors that apply to a category of employees, such as past recruitment and retention problems or the anticipation of such problems in the future. § 575.506 When is an agency prohibited from paying an extended assign-ment incentive? (a) An extended assignment incentive may not be paid to the head of an agen-cy, including an agency headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members. (b) An agency may not begin paying an extended assignment incentive to an otherwise eligible employee who is re-ceiving or fulfilling the requirements of a service agreement for the payment of a recruitment, relocation, or reten-tion incentive.

[68 FR 53669, Sept. 12, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 25752, May 13, 2005] § 575.507 What is the maximum ex- tended assignment incentive that may be paid for a period of service? (a) The total amount of extended as- signment incentive payments that may be paid for a service period may not ex-ceed the greater of— (1) An amount equal to 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the em-ployee at the beginning of the service period times the number of years (in-cluding fractions of a year) in the serv-ice period; or (2) $15,000 per year (including frac- tions of a year) in the service period. (b) For hourly rate employees who do not have a scheduled annual rate of basic pay, the annual rate in paragraph (a) of this section is computed by mul-tiplying the applicable hourly rate in effect at the beginning of the service period by 2,087 hours. (c) The number of years in the serv- ice period is computed by dividing the total number of calendar days in the service period (as established under §575.510(a)) by 365 and rounding the re-sult to two decimal places. For exam-ple, a service period covering 39 bi-weekly pay periods equals 546 days, and 546 days divided by 365 days equals 1.50 years. § 575.508 What is the maximum amount of service that may be cov-ered by an extended assignment in-centive? An employee’s total service under one or more extended assignment in-centive service agreements with a par-ticular agency for service in a par-ticular territory, possession, or com-monwealth may not exceed 5 years. For this purpose, a year is equal to 365 days, resulting in a total service limit of 1,825 days. § 575.509 Is an extended assignment incentive considered basic pay for any purpose? No, an extended assignment incen- tive is not considered part of an em-ployee’s rate of basic pay for any pur-pose, nor is it included for the purpose of calculating a lump-sum payment for annual leave under 5 CFR 550.1205. § 575.510 What requirements are asso- ciated with service agreements? (a) Before paying an extended assign- ment incentive, the agency must re-quire the employee to sign a written service agreement to complete a speci-fied period of employment with the agency in a particular territory, pos-session, or commonwealth. The service period must meet the following condi-tions: (1) The service period must begin on the first day of a pay period and end on the last day of a pay period; and (2) The service period must not cause an employee to exceed the 5-year life-time limitation described in §575.508. (b) In addition to the service require- ment in paragraph (a) of this section, the service agreement may specify other terms and conditions of employ-ment applicable to the employee. For example,', 'day is the maximum allowance. Degree A Commuting Conditions Good paved roads; climatic conditions cause intermittent driving difficulty.

The question demonstrates a substantive information need that is directly applicable to:

1. Federal employees serving in military or uniformed services
2. HR specialists managing reemployment processes
3. Managers understanding legal obligations for employees returning from service
4. Employees seeking to understand their rights and protections

The question probes two key dimensions of restoration rights:
- The actual rights of employees to return to their federal positions
- Specific limitations on service duration that might impact reemployment

This type of inquiry is practical, addresses a real-world scenario faced by many federal employees who serve in the military or other uniformed services, and requires a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations. It goes beyond surface-level information and seeks to understand both the rights and potential constraints, which makes it particularly valuable for comprehensive policy understanding.

The technical nature of the question suggests a serious, informed approach to understanding complex federal employment protections, making it highly useful for stakeholders across the federal employment ecosystem."
 Under what circumstances may an agency pay travel expenses for a new appointee or job candidate?," According to § 572.101 and § 572.102, an agency has discretionary authority to pay travel and transportation expenses for:

2. Job candidates attending pre-employment interviews

The payment will be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR).

A decision made in connection with one specific vacancy does not require a like decision in con-nection with future vacancies. In decid-ing to pay travel and transportation or interview expenses in filling any posi-tion, the agency should consider such factors as availability of funds as well as the desirability of conducting inter-views for a particular job or offering a recruiting incentive to a particular candidate. § 572.103 Recordkeeping.

Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that the term also includes an employee de-scribed in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c). For the pur-pose of determining whether an indi-vidual was an employee of the Federal Government during the 90-day period referred to in the definition of newly appointed, employee also includes an employee described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(e). For the purpose of §575.109(d), an em- ployee means an individual not yet em- ployed who has received a written offer to be newly appointed or reappointed and has signed the written service agreement required by §575.110 before payment of the recruitment incentive.

(b) When submitting a plan to OPM, the agency may submit either: (1) A specific Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment implementation plan outlining the intended use of the incentive payments, or (2) The agency’s human capital plan, which outlines the intended use of the incentive payments and the expected changes in the agency’s organizational structure after the agency has com-pleted the incentive payments. If the human capital plan is submitted, it must include the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section. (c) OPM will consult with the Office of Management and Budget regarding the plan and any subsequent modifica-tions, and will notify the agency head in writing when the plan is approved.

(c) An agency’s downsizing and/or re- shaping strategy may change, necessi-tating a change in the offer notice to employees. If the amended notice in-cludes a revised closing date, or a re-vised number of applications to be ac-cepted, the new date or number of ap-plications must be announced to the same group of employees included in the original announcement. If a new or separate notice includes a new window period with a new closing date, or a new instance of a specific number of applications to be accepted, the new window period or number of applica-tions to be accepted may be announced to a different group of employees as long as the new group is covered by the approved Voluntary Separation Incen-tive Payment authority. (d) Section 4311 of title 38, United States Code, requires that, for all prac-tical purposes, agencies treat employ-ees on military duty as though they were still on the job. Further, employ-ees are not to be disadvantaged because of their military duty. In accordance with these provisions, employees on military duty who would otherwise be eligible for an offer of a Voluntary Sep-aration Incentive Payment will have 30 days following their return to duty to either accept or reject an offer of a Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay-ment. This is true even if the Vol-untary Separation Incentive Payment authority provided by OPM has ex-pired. (e) An employee may separate from the service voluntarily, with a Vol-untary Separation Incentive Payment, if, on the date of separation, the em-ployee: (1) Is serving in a position covered by a Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay-ment offer; and (2) Meets the definition of employee discussed in 5 U.S.C. 3521. (f) Agencies are responsible for ensur- ing that employees are not coerced into accepting', 'be required to establish an es-crow account to comply with the legal process even if the applicable law of the jurisdiction requires private em-ployers to do so. (d) Under the circumstances set forth in §582.305 (a) or (b), or where the agen-cy is directed by the Justice Depart-ment not to comply with the legal process, the agency shall respond di-rectly to the court, or other authority, setting forth its reasons for non-com-pliance with the legal process. In addi-tion, the agency shall inform the per-son who caused the legal process to be served, or the person’s representative, that the legal process will not be hon-ored. Thereafter, if litigation is initi-ated or appears imminent, the agency shall immediately refer the matter to the United States Attorney for the dis-trict from which the legal process issued. To ensure uniformity in the ex-ecutive branch, agencies which have statutory authority to represent them-selves in court shall coordinate their representation with the United States Attorney.

Provided further, That processes which are not limited in time shall preserve their priority based on time of service until fully satisfied. Generally, a modified order will retain its original priority while a time lim-ited order will lose its priority after it has expired. (f) Legal process to which an agency is subject under sections 459, 461, and 462 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659, 661, and 662) for the enforce-ment of an employee’s legal obligation to provide child support or to make ali-mony payments, including child sup-port or alimony arrearages, shall have priority over any legal process to which an agency is subject under this part. In addition to having priority, compliance with legal process to which an agency is subject under sections 459, 461, and 462 of the Social Security Act may exhaust the moneys available for compliance with legal process under this part. See §582.402(a). (g)(1) Neither the United States, and executive agency, nor any disbursing officer shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or pay-able by, the United States to any indi-vidual pursuant to legal process reg-ular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part. (2) Neither the United States, an ex- ecutive agency, nor any disbursing offi-cer shall be liable under this part to pay money damages for failure to com-ply with the legal process. (h) Agencies affected by legal process served under this part shall not be re-quired to vary their normal pay or dis-bursement cycles to comply with the legal process. However, legal process, valid at the time of service, which is received too late to be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it is received, shall be honored, to the ex-tent that the legal process may be sat-isfied, during the next disbursement cycle within the limits set forth in §582.402. The fact that the legal process may have expired during this period would not relieve the agency of its ob-ligation to honor legal process which was valid at the time of service. If, in the next disbursement cycle, no further payment will be due from the agency to the employee-obligor, the agency shall follow the procedures set forth in §582.306. (i) Agencies need not establish es- crow accounts in order to comply with legal process. Therefore, even if the amount garnished by an agency in one disbursement cycle is not sufficient to satisfy the entire indebtedness, the agency need not retain those funds until the amount retained would sat-isfy the entire indebtedness. On the contrary, agencies will, in most in-stances, remit the garnished amount after each disbursement cycle. Agen-cies need not pro-rate payments for less than a full disbursement cycle. (j) If an agency receives legal process which is regular on its face, the agency shall not be required to ascertain whether the authority which issued the legal process had obtained personal ju-risdiction over the employee-obligor. (k) At the discretion of the executive agency, the agency’s administrative costs in executing a garnishment may be added to the garnishment amount and the agency may retain costs recov-ered as offsetting collections. To facili-tate recovery of these administrative costs, an administrative fee may be as-sessed for each legal process that is re-ceived and processed by an agency, pro-vided that the fee constitutes the agen-cy’s administrative costs in executing the garnishment action. (l) Where an employee-obligor has filed a bankruptcy petition under sec-tion 301 or 302 of title 11 of the United States Code, or is the debtor named in an involuntary petition filed under sec-tion 303 of title 11, the agency must cease garnishment proceedings affected by the automatic stay provision, sec-tion 362(a) of title 11. Upon filing a pe-tition in bankruptcy or upon learning that he or she is the debtor named in an involuntary petition, the employee- obligor should immediately notify the agency.

(m) Within 30 days following the col- lection of the amount required in the garnishment order, the creditor may submit a final statement of interest that accrued during the garnishment process, and the employing agency shall process the statement for pay-ment, provided the garnishment order authorizes the collection of such inter-est. This final statement of interest should be accompanied by a statement of account showing how the interest was computed.

Except as set forth in this section, eligibility requirements for appointment under a Pathways Program are specified in each Path-ways Program. (e) Citizenship. (1) An agency may ap- point a non-citizen provided that: (i) The Pathways Participant is law- fully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident or is otherwise authorized to be employed; and (ii) The agency is authorized to pay aliens under the annual Appropriations Act ban and any agency-specific ena-bling and appropriation statutes. (2) A Pathways Participant must be a United States citizen to be eligible for noncompetitive conversion to the com-petitive service. (f) Employment of relatives. In accord- ance with part 310 of this chapter, a Pathways Participant may work in the same agency with a relative when there is no direct reporting relation-ship and the relative is not in a posi-tion to influence or control the Partici-pant’s appointment, employment, pro-motion or advancement within the agency. (g) Length of Appointments. Except as provided in subpart B, Recent Graduate and PMF appointments under this au-thority may not exceed 2 years plus any agency-approved extension of up to 120 days. (h) Terminations. An agency may ter- minate a Pathways Participant for rea-sons including misconduct, poor per-formance, or suitability under the pro-visions of this chapter. (i) Performance and progress evalua- tion. Each Participant must be placed on a performance plan, as prescribed by part 430 of this chapter or other appli-cable law or regulation, establishing performance elements and standards that are directly related to acquiring and demonstrating the various leader-ship, technical, and/or general com-petencies expected of the Participant, as well as the elements and standards established for the duties assigned. (j) Compensation. The rules for setting pay upon the initial appointment of a Participant are governed by the pay administration rules of the pay system or pay plan of the Participant’s posi-tion under the Pathways program. In determining the Participant’s com-pensation, agencies may also use any applicable pay flexibilities available under that pay system or pay plan (e.g., recruitment, relocation, and re-tention incentives under part 575 of this chapter; student loan repayments under part 537; and, for General Sched-ule positions, special rates under part 530, subpart C, and the superior quali-fications and special needs pay setting authority and the maximum payable rate rule under part 531, subpart B). § 362.106 Participant Agreement. Agencies must execute a written Par- ticipant Agreement with each Path-ways Participant that clearly identi-fies expectations, including but not limited to: (a) A general description of duties; (b) Work schedules; (c) The length of the appointment and termination date; (d) Mentorship opportunities; (e) Training requirements as applica- ble; (f) Evaluation procedures that will be used for the Participant; (g) Requirements for continuation and successful completion of the Pro-gram; and (h) Minimum eligibility requirements for noncompetitive conversion to term or permanent competitive service em-ployment according to the require-ments of the applicable Pathways Pro-gram. § 362.107 Conversion to the competi- tive service. (a) Subject to any limits on conver- sion imposed by the Director, and in accordance with the provisions of each Pathways Program, an agency may noncompetitively convert an eligible Pathways Participant to a term or per-manent competitive service position.

(c) Noncompetitive conversion. (1) An Intern may be converted to a position within the employing agency or any other agency within the Federal Gov-ernment. (2) A Recent Graduate may be con- verted to a position within the employ-ing agency or any other agency within the Federal Government. Conversion to position at a different agency is subject to §362.305(c). (3) A PMF may be converted within the employing agency or any other agency within the Federal Govern-ment. Conversion to position at a dif-ferent agency is subject to §362.409(c). (d) The provisions of the career tran- sition assistance programs in subparts B, F and G of part 330 of this chapter do not apply to conversions made under this part. (e) Time spent serving as a Pathways Participant counts towards career ten-ure when the individual is noncompeti-tively converted to a permanent posi-tion in the competitive service upon completion of the Program, with or without an intervening term appoint-ment, and without a break in service of one day. (f) Though Pathways Participants are eligible for noncompetitive conver-sion to the competitive service upon successful completion of their Program and any other applicable conversion re-quirements, service in a Pathways Pro-gram confers no right to further em-ployment in either the competitive or excepted service. An agency wishing to convert a Pathways Participant must therefore execute the required actions to do so.

(b) The Director may establish such caps based on agency or Government-wide use of the Pathways Programs, input from the Executive agencies, and consideration of the following: (1) An agency’s compliance with its Pathways Policy; (2) Agency approach to entry-level hiring; (3) Agency engagement in sound workforce planning to ensure that an adequate number of permanent posi-tions will be available to which Path-ways Participants who successfully complete their Programs can be con-verted; (4) Agency record in using the Path- ways Programs as a supplement to competitive examining, rather than as a substitute for it; (5) Agency record of publicizing their positions in the Pathways Programs and recruiting and selecting from a broad array of sources; and (6) Any other information the Direc- tor deems relevant.

For HR specialists and hiring managers, it directly addresses a critical aspect of recruitment and onboarding procedures. New appointees and job candidates will be interested in understanding potential travel reimbursement, which can be a significant factor in accepting federal employment. The question touches on an important administrative policy within Title 5 that governs federal employment practices, specifically addressing travel and relocation expenses.

The question is relevant because:
1. It relates to recruitment and hiring processes
2. It involves potential financial considerations for both the agency and the employee
3. It requires understanding specific regulatory guidelines for travel expense reimbursement
4. It has direct implications for budget planning and personnel management

Stakeholders who would find this particularly useful include:
- HR recruitment specialists
- Federal hiring managers
- Job candidates considering federal positions
- Agency budget planners
- Employees involved in relocation or recruitment processes

The question is practical, specific, and seeks clear information about a real-world employment scenario, making it highly valuable for understanding federal employment regulations."

(a) An authorized agency official must establish the criteria for deter-mining the amount of a relocation in-centive. An agency may pay a reloca-tion incentive— (1) As an initial lump-sum payment at the commencement of the service period required by the service agree-ment; (2) In installments throughout the service period required by the service agreement; (3) As a final lump-sum payment upon the completion of the full service period required by the service agree-ment; or (4) In a combination of these pay- ment methods. (b)(1) Except as provided in para- graph (c) of this section, the total amount of relocation incentive pay-ments paid to an employee in a service period may not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the em-ployee at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including fractions of a year) in the service period (not to exceed 4 years). (2) For hourly rate employees who do not have a scheduled annual rate of basic pay, compute the annual rate re-quired for paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion by multiplying the applicable hourly rate in effect at the beginning of the service period by 2,087 hours. (3) For the purpose of determining the number of years in a service period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, divide the total number of calendar days in the service period (as estab-lished under §575.208) by 365 and round the result to two decimal places. For example, a service period covering 39 biweekly pay periods equals 546 days, and 546 days divided by 365 days equals 1.50 years. (c)(1) An authorized agency official may request that OPM waive the limi-tation in paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion for an employee based on a critical agency need. The authorized agency of-ficial must determine that the com-petencies required for the position are critical to the successful accomplish-ment of an important agency mission, project, or initiative (e.g., programs or projects related to a national emer-gency or implementing a new law or critical management initiative).

(e) Payment of a relocation incentive is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. § 575.210 Service agreement require- ments. (a) Before paying a relocation incen- tive, an agency must require the em-ployee to sign a written service agree-ment to complete a specified period of employment with the agency (or suc-cessor agency in the event of a transfer of function) at the new duty station. An authorized agency official must es-tablish the criteria for determining the length of a service period. The service period may not exceed 4 years. (b)(1) The service agreement must in- clude the commencement and termi-nation dates of the required service pe-riod. Except as provided under para-graphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the required service period must begin upon the commencement of service at the new duty station. The service pe-riod must terminate on the last day of a pay period. (2) If service at the new duty station does not begin on the first day of a pay period, the agency must delay the serv-ice period commencement date so that a required service period begins on the first day of the first pay period begin- ning on or after the commencement of service at the new duty station. (3) An agency may delay a service agreement commencement date until after the employee completes an initial period of formal training when contin- ued employment in the position is con-tingent on successful completion of the formal training. The agency must make the determination to pay a relo-cation incentive before the employee enters on duty in the position, as re-quired by §575.208(a)(3). However, the service agreement must specify that if an employee does not successfully com-plete the training before the service pe-riod commences, the agency is not ob-ligated to pay any portion of the relo-cation incentive to the employee. (c) The service agreement must specify the total amount of the incen-tive, the method of paying the incen-tive, and the timing and amount of each incentive payment, as established under §575.209. (d) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency must terminate the service agreement ( i.e., if an employee is de- moted or separated for cause, receives a rating of record of less than ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equivalent, fails to maintain residency in the new geo-graphic area for the duration of the service agreement, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agree-ment) and the conditions under which the employee must repay a relocation incentive under §575.211. An agency must define the limits of the new geo-graphic area in the service agreement for the purpose of determining whether an employee maintains residency in that geographic area for the duration of the service agreement. (e) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency may terminate the service agreement before the employee com-pletes the agreed-upon service period. The service agreement must specify the effect of the termination under §575.211, including the conditions under which the agency will pay an addi-tional relocation incentive payment for partially completed service under §575.211(e) and (f).

(a) OPM may increase the minimum rates of pay otherwise payable to a cat-egory of employees in one or more areas or locations, grades or levels, oc-cupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, when it is nec-essary to address existing or likely sig-nificant recruitment or retention dif-ficulties. OPM will consider the cir-cumstances listed in paragraph (b) of this section and the factors listed in §530.306 when evaluating the need for special rates. When OPM establishes a minimum special rate under this au-thority, corresponding increases also may be made in one or more of the re-maining rates of the affected grade or level. For any given grade, a minimum special rate may not exceed the max-imum rate of basic pay for the rate range (excluding any locality rate, other special rate, or similar payment under other legal authority) by more than 30 percent. A special rate may not exceed the rate for level IV of the Ex-ecutive Schedule. (b) The circumstances considered by OPM in evaluating the need for special rates are the following: (1) Rates of pay offered by non-Fed- eral employers which are significantly higher than those payable by the Gov-ernment within the area, location, oc-cupational group, or other category of positions under GS pay system; (2) The remoteness of the area or lo- cation involved; (3) The undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational haz-ards); (4) Locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for the area involved; (5) A nonforeign area cost-of-living allowance authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1) for the area involved; or (6) Any other circumstances OPM considers appropriate. (c) In setting the level of special rates within a rate range for a category of employees, OPM will compute the special rate supplement by adding a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percent-age to all GS rates within that range, except that an alternate method may be used— (1) For grades GS–1 and GS–2, where within-grade increases vary through-out the range; and (2) In the nonforeign areas listed in 5 CFR 591.205 for special rate schedules established before January 1, 2012. (d) If OPM establishes a special rate schedule that covers only law enforce-ment officers, OPM may compute the special rate supplement for grades GS– 3 through 10 as a fixed percentage of LEO special base rates instead of GS rates. With respect to such a schedule, references to GS rates in §530.307 are deemed to be references to LEO special base rates. (e) Using its authority in section 1918(a)(1) of the Non-Foreign Area Re-tirement Equity Assurance Act of 2009 in combination with its authority under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may establish a separate special rate schedule for a category of employees who are in GS positions covered by a nonforeign area special rate schedule in effect on Janu-ary 1, 2012, and who are employed in a nonforeign area before an OPM-speci-fied effective date. Such a separate schedule may be established if the ex-isting special rate schedule is being re-duced. An employee’s coverage under the separate special rate schedule is contingent on the employee being con-tinuously employed in a covered GS po-sition in the nonforeign area after the OPM-specified effective date. Such a separate special rate schedule must be designed to provide temporary pay pro-tection and be phased out over time until all affected employees are cov-ered under the pay schedule that would otherwise apply to the category of em-ployees in question.

The request must include a certifi-cation by the authorized agency offi-cial that the requested special rates are necessary to ensure adequate staff-ing levels to accomplish the agency’s mission. (b) The authorized agency official is responsible for submitting complete supporting data for any request for new or higher special rates. OPM may re-quire that the supporting data include a survey of prevailing non-Federal pay rates in the relevant labor market. (c) OPM may coordinate an agency special rate request with other agen-cies that have similar categories of em-ployees. OPM may designate a lead agency to assist in coordinating the collection of relevant data. Each af-fected agency is responsible for submit-ting complete supporting data upon re-quest to OPM or the lead agency, as ap-propriate, unless the agency deter-mines that a category of its employees will not be covered by the proposed special rate schedule, as provided in §530.303(c). § 530.306 Evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates. (a) In evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates, OPM may consider the following factors: (1) The number of existing vacant po- sitions and the length of time they have been vacant; (2) The number of employees who have quit ( i.e., voluntarily left Federal service), including, when available, a subcount of the number of employees who quit to take a comparable position offering higher pay; (3) Evidence to support a conclusion that recruitment or retention problems likely will develop (if such problems do not already exist) or will worsen; (4) The number of vacancies an agen- cy tried to fill, compared to the num-ber of hires and offers made; (5) The nature of the existing labor market; (6) The degree to which an agency has considered and used other', 'the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of inves-tigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a signifi-cant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed. (b) Although not exhaustive, the fol- lowing factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the author-ity head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct ( i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint; (1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements; (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made; (3) The degree of the defendant’s cul- pability with respect to the mis-conduct; (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR61 Office of Personnel Management § 185.134 (5) The value of the Government’s ac- tual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation; (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government’s loss; (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government pro-grams and operations; (8) Whether the defendant has en- gaged in a pattern of the same or simi-lar misconduct; (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct; (10) The degree to which the defend- ant has involved others in the mis-conduct or in concealing it; (11) Where the misconduct of employ- ees or agents is imputed to the defend-ant, the extent to which the defend-ant’s practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct; (12) Whether the defendant cooper- ated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct; (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers; (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant’s sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the de-fendant’s prior participation in the program or in similar transactions; (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or admin-istrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, di-rectly or indirectly; (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and (17) The potential impact of the mis- conduct on the rights of others.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by wit- nesses under oath or affirmation. (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, tes- timony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be pro-vided to all others parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in §185.123(a).

The question targets a specific procedural requirement that would be critically important for HR specialists, managers involved in technology workforce development, and employees considering such exchanges.

The question demonstrates practical value by focusing on the planning and establishment requirements for an IT exchange program. It suggests there are specific regulatory guidelines that must be followed when implementing such workforce mobility initiatives. This is particularly useful for:

1. HR professionals who need to understand compliance requirements
2. Agency managers considering technology workforce exchanges
3. Employees interested in potential cross-sector professional development opportunities
4. Compliance officers ensuring proper implementation of workforce exchange programs

The technical nature of the question indicates a sophisticated information need related to the nuanced implementation of federal workforce mobility policies. While slightly specialized, it represents a genuine and important regulatory consideration that could have significant implications for how agencies manage technology talent and facilitate knowledge transfer between public and private sectors."

(a) To register, an RPL eligible must: (1) Meet the eligibility conditions under §330.203(a) or (b); (2) Complete an RPL application pre- scribed by the current or former agen-cy and keep the agency informed of any significant changes in the informa-tion provided; and (3) Submit the RPL application on or before the RIF separation date or, if an RPL eligible under §330.203(b), within 30 calendar days after the: (i) Date injury compensation benefits cease; or (ii) Date the Department of Labor de- nies an appeal for continuation of in-jury compensation benefits. (b) RPL eligibles may register and re- ceive placement priority for positions for which they are qualified and that: (1) Have a representative rate no higher than the position from which they were, or will be, separated unless the eligible was demoted as a tenure group I or II employee in a previous RIF. If the eligible was so demoted, the eligible can register for positions with a representative rate up to the rep-resentative rate of the position held on a permanent appointment immediately before the RIF demotion was effective; (2) Have no greater promotion poten- tial than the position from which they were, or will be, separated; and (3) Have the same type of work sched- ule as the position from which they were, or will be, separated. § 330.207 Registration area. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, RPL reg-istration is limited to the local com-muting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated. (b) If the agency has, or will have, no competitive service positions remain-ing in the local commuting area from which the RPL eligible will be sepa-rated under part 351 of this chapter, the agency may designate a different local commuting area where there are con-tinuing positions for the RPL eligible to exercise placement priority.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 330.208 agency has sole discretion over wheth- er to offer this option and which local commuting area to designate, taking into consideration the size and loca-tions of its workforce, available vacan-cies, and available funds. (c) If the RPL eligible agreed to transfer with his or her function under part 351 of this chapter but will be sep-arated by RIF from the gaining com-petitive area, registration is limited to the RPL covering the gaining competi-tive area’s local commuting area. (d) For an individual who is eligible under §330.203(b), registration is ini-tially limited to the RPL covering the local commuting area of the position from which the employee was sepa-rated. The agency must establish a fair and consistent policy that permits RPL eligibles to expand their registra-tion to available local commuting areas mutually acceptable to the RPL eligible and the agency, up to agency- wide as required by 5 U.S.C. 8151. (For example, an agency could consider the number and location(s) of its positions and funding availability when estab-lishing its policies on expanding con-sideration.) In lieu of expanded reg-istration, the agency policy may pro-vide for the RPL eligible to elect to re-ceive placement priority for the next best available position in the former local commuting area. (e) If the RPL eligible was, or will be, separated from an overseas position (see part 301 of this chapter), RPL reg- istration is limited to the local com-muting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated, unless: (1) The agency approves a written re- quest by the RPL eligible for registra-tion in the local commuting area from which employed for overseas service, or in another area within the United States that is mutually acceptable to the eligible and the agency; or (2) The agency has a formal program for rotating employees between over-seas areas and the United States, and the RPL eligible’s preceding and pro-spective overseas service would exceed the maximum duration of an overseas duty tour in the rotation program. In this case, the eligible may register for a local commuting area within the United States that is mutually accept-able to the eligible and the agency. § 330.208 Duration of RPL registration. (a) RPL registration expires 2 years from the date of reduction in force sep-aration under part 351 of this chapter, or 2 years from the date the agency registers the RPL eligible because of recovery from a compensable work in-jury under §330.206(a)(3)(i) or (ii). An RPL eligible remains registered for the full 2-year period unless the registrant is removed from the RPL for a reason specified in §330.209. (b)(1) OPM may extend the registra- tion period when an RPL eligible does not receive a full 2 years of placement priority, for example, because of an agency’s administrative or procedural error. (2) Either the agency or the RPL eli- gible may request OPM to extend the registration period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The request must describe the administrative or proce-dural error that caused the RPL eligi-ble to be registered for less than the full 2-year period. OPM may request additional information either from the agency or the RPL eligible in connec-tion with any such request. OPM will notify both the agency and the RPL el-igible of the decision to approve or deny an extension request. OPM’s deci-sion regarding an extension request is not subject to appeal under §330.214. § 330.209 Removal from an RPL. (a) An RPL registrant', 'current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Prevailing rate employee has the mean- ing given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5342(a)(2) and refers to an employee in a position covered by a prevailing rate system or schedule established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV. Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position held by an em-ployee before any deductions, including a General Schedule rate under 5 U.S.C. 5332; a law enforcement officer special base rate under section 403 of FEPCA; a special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or similar payment under other legal authority; a locality rate under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F, or similar payment under other legal au-thority; a prevailing rate under 5 U.S.C. 5343; or a retained rate under this part, but excluding additional pay of any other kind (such as premium payments, differentials, and allow-ances). Rate range or range means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. Reasonable offer means an offer that meets the conditions in §536.104. Reduced in grade or pay at the employ- ee’s request means a reduction in grade or rate of basic pay that is initiated by the employee for his or her benefit, convenience, or personal advantage. A reduction in grade or pay that is caused or influenced by a management action is not considered to be at an em-ployee’s request, except that the vol-untary reduction in grade or pay of an employee in response to a management action directly related to personal cause is considered to be at the em-ployee’s request. Reduced in grade or pay for personal cause means a reduction in grade or rate of basic pay based on the conduct, character, or unacceptable perform-ance of an employee. In situations in which an employee is reduced in grade or pay for inability to perform the du-ties of his or her position because of a medical or physical condition beyond the employee’s control, the reduction in grade or pay is not considered to be for personal cause. Reorganization means the planned elimination, addition, redistribution, or restructuring of functions or duties either wholly within an agency or be-tween agencies.

Temporary promotion means a pro- motion that has a definite time limita-tion or is otherwise designated as tem-porary when the affected employee is informed in advance. Temporary reassignment means a reas- signment that has a definite time limi-tation or is otherwise designated as temporary when the affected employee is informed in advance. Where different pay schedules apply means, in the context of applying the geographic conversion rule, that an employee’s official worksite is changed to a new location that would cause the employee to lose or gain coverage under a location-based pay schedule if the employee were to remain in the same position of record.

(a) For the purpose of determining whether grade retention eligibility or entitlement must be terminated under §536.207 or 536.208, the offer of a posi-tion is a reasonable offer if the posi-tion’s grade is equal to or higher than the retained grade and if all the condi-tions in paragraph (c) of this section are met. If the offered position is in a different pay system, §536.105 must be applied to determine whether the grade of the offered position is equal to or greater than the retained grade. (b) For the purpose of determining whether pay retention eligibility or en-titlement must be terminated under §536.308, the offer of a position is a rea-sonable offer if the employee’s rate of basic pay in the position would be equal to or greater than the rate to which the employee is or would be enti-tled under the pay retention provisions and if all the conditions in paragraph (c) of this section are met. (c) An offer of a position must meet the following additional conditions to qualify as a reasonable offer: (1) The offer must be in writing and must include an official position de-scription of the offered position; (2) The offer must inform the em- ployee that entitlement to grade or pay retention will terminate if the offer is declined and that the employee may appeal the reasonableness of the offer as provided in §536.402; (3) The offered position must be of equal or greater tenure than the em-ployee’s position before the action re-sulting in the grade or pay retention entitlement; (4) The offered position must be full- time, unless the employee’s position immediately before the action result-ing in entitlement to grade or pay re-tention was less than full-time, in which case the offered position must have a work schedule providing for no fewer hours of work per week or per pay period than the position held be-fore the action; and (5) The offered position must be in the same commuting area as the em-ployee’s position immediately before the offer, unless the employee is sub-ject to a mobility agreement or a pub- lished agency policy that requires em-ployee mobility. § 536.105 Comparing grades under dif- ferent pay systems. (a) General. An agency must compare the comparison rates (as defined in §536.103) of the applicable grades to de-termine whether a grade of a position is equal to, higher than, or lower than the grade of another position when— (1) Determining eligibility for grade retention upon movement from a posi-tion under a covered pay system to a lower-graded position under a different covered pay system (including deter-minations under §536.203 that involve different covered pay systems); (2) Determining whether grade reten- tion eligibility is lost or grade reten-tion is terminated when an employee is placed in a lower-graded position under a different covered', 'and re- quirements for the position, including any minimum educational require-ment, and any selective placement fac-tors established by the agency; (2) Is physically qualified, with rea- sonable accommodation where appro-priate, to perform the duties of the po-sition; (3) Meets any special qualifying con- dition which the OPM has approved for the position; and (4) Has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfac-torily perform the duties of the posi-tion without undue interruption. This determination includes recency of ex-perience, when appropriate. (b) The sex of an employee may not be considered in determining whether an employee is qualified for a position, except for positions which OPM has de-termined certification of eligibles by sex is justified. (c) An employee who is released from a competitive level during a leave of absence because of a corpensable injury may not be denied an assignment right solely because the employee is not physically qualified for the duties of the position if the physical disquali-fication resulted from the compensable injury.

(d) If an agency determines, on the basis of evidence before it, that a pref-erence eligible employee who has a compensable service-connected dis-ability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of a position to which the employee would otherwise have been assigned under this part, the agency must notify the OPM of this determination. At the same time, the agency must notify the employee of the reasons for the deter-mination and of the right to respond, within 15 days of the notification, to the OPM which will require the agency to demonstrate that the notification was timely sent to the employee’s last known address. The OPM shall make a final determination concerning the physical ability of the employee to per-form the duties of the position. This determination must be made before the agency may select any other person for the position. When the OPM has com-pleted its review of the proposed dis-qualification on the basis of physical disability, it must sent its finding to both the agency and the employee. The agency must comply with the findings of the OPM. The functions of the OPM under this paragraph may not be dele-gated to an agency. (e) An agency may formally des- ignate as a trainee or developmental position a position in a program with all of the following characteristics: (1) The program must have been de- signed to meet the agency’s needs and requirements for the development of skilled personnel; (2) The program must have been for- mally designated, with its provisions made known to employees and super-visors; (3) The program must be develop- mental by design, offering planned growth in duties and responsibilities, and providing advancement in recog-nized lines of career progression; and (4) The program must be fully imple- mented, with the participants chosen through standard selection procedures. To be considered qualified for assign-ment under §351.701 to a formally des-ignated trainee or developmental posi-tion in a program having all of the characteristics covered in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, an employee must meet all of the condi-tions required for selection and entry into the program.

Instead, the former employing agency must trans-fer the employee’s accumulated and ac-crued annual leave to the current agen-cy (if the part-time positions are in dif-ferent agencies) or credit the employ-ee’s annual leave account in the cur-rent position (if the part-time positions are in the same agency). (6) An employee who elects to retain his or her leave benefits upon accepting a Presidential appointment, as per-mitted by 5 U.S.C. 3392(c). (i) An agency must establish a policy for determining when an employee in a continuing employment program with a mixed tour of duty will receive a lump-sum payment for annual leave. The agency may choose to pay an em-ployee a lump-sum payment when he or she is assigned intermittent duty or hold the employee’s annual leave in abeyance during intermittent duty and recredit it when the employee returns without a break in service to full-time or part-time employment. If the agen-cy decides to hold the employee’s an-nual leave in abeyance, it must also hold in abeyance the credit for any fractional pay period earned and re-credit the annual leave on a pro rata basis, as provided in §630.204 of this chapter, when the employee returns to full-time or part-time employment. In developing its policy, each agency must consider the likelihood that the employee will return to work, as well as the agency’s mission requirements and staffing needs. The agency’s policy must ensure that employees are treat-ed in a fair and equitable manner. § 550.1204 Projecting the lump-sum leave period.

(a) An agency must compute a lump- sum payment based on the types of pay listed in paragraph (b) of this section, as in effect at the time the affected employee becomes eligible for a lump- sum payment under §550.1203 and any adjustments in pay included in para-graphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section. The agency must calculate a lump-sum payment by multiplying the number of hours of accumulated and accrued an-nual leave by the applicable hourly rate of pay, including other applicable types of pay listed in paragraph (b) of this section, or by using a mathemati-cally equivalent method, such as mul-tiplying weeks of annual leave by the applicable weekly rate of pay. If the agency calculates a lump-sum payment using weekly rates, the number of weeks of annual leave must be rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., 0.4444). The agency must convert an an-nual rate of pay to an hourly rate of pay by dividing the annual rate of pay by 2,087 (or 2,756 for firefighters, if ap-plicable) and rounding it to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the next higher cent. (b) The agency must compute a lump- sum payment using the following types of pay and pay adjustments, as applica-ble: (1) An employee’s rate of basic pay (as defined in §550.1202); (2) Any statutory adjustments in pay or any general system-wide increases in pay, such as adjustments under sec-tions 5303, 5304, 5305, 5318, 5362, 5363, 5372, 5372a, 5376, 5382, or 5392 of title 5, United States Code, that become effec-tive during the lump-sum leave period. The agency must adjust the lump-sum payment to reflect the increased rate on and after the effective date of the pay adjustment. (3) In the case of a prevailing rate employee, the agency must include in the lump-sum payment the scheduled rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5343, 5348, or 5349 and any applicable adjustments in rates that are determined under 5 U.S.C. 5343, 5348, or 5349 that become ef-fective during the lump-sum leave pe-riod. The agency must adjust the lump- sum payment to reflect the increased prevailing rate on and after the effec-tive date of the rate adjustment.

It directly addresses a critical aspect of employee rights and workplace policies under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is covered under Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

The question is practical because it seeks to clarify the specific circumstances under which federal employees can take extended unpaid leave, which is a common concern for workers who may need to address personal or family medical situations. HR specialists, managers, and employees would find this information crucial for understanding leave entitlements and planning accordingly.

The question covers a substantive policy area that impacts:
- Employee rights and protections
- Workplace flexibility
- Family and medical care support
- Compliance with federal employment regulations

Potential stakeholders who would benefit include:
1. HR professionals managing leave policies
2. Managers understanding employee leave rights
3. Federal employees planning for potential medical or family care needs
4. Employees seeking to understand their leave entitlements
5. Legal professionals interpreting employment regulations

(b) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment is responsible for: (1) Establishing and subsequently ad- justing, in accordance with the provi-sions of this subpart, an allowance for each remote duty post which does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of §591.304, but does meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) or paragraph (c) of §591.304; (2) Reviewing each establishment or adjustment of an allowance by an agen-cy under paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion to determine if such establishment or adjustment is in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; and (3) Directing the termination or ad- justment of any allowance determined by the Office to be not in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, which termination or adjustment shall be implemented by the agency without delay. (c) Each allowance which has been authorized by the Office of Personnel Management or the Civil Service Com-mission on or before February 1, 1979, and which is authorized for a remote duty post which meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of §591.304, shall be subject to further adjustment by the agency under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as if such allowance had been initially authorized by the agency under that paragraph. § 591.304 Criteria for determining re- moteness. (a) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a duty post shall be determined to be a remote duty post for basic allowance eligi-bility purposes when: (1) Normal ground transportation (e.g., automobile, train, bus) is avail-able on a daily basis and the duty post is 80 kilometers (50 miles), or more, one way from the nearest established com-munity or suitable place of residence. Distance shall be computed in road or rail kilometers (miles) over the most direct route traveled from the center of the city, or other appropriate point for large cities or areas; or (2) Daily commuting is impractical because the location of the duty post VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00835 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR826 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 591.305 and available transportation are such that agency management requires em-ployees to remain at the duty post for their workweek as a normal and con-tinuing part of the conditions of em-ployment; or (3) Transportation may be accom- plished only by boat, aircraft, or un-usual conveyance, or under extraor-dinary conditions, and the distance, time, and commuting conditions result in expense, inconvenience, or hardship significantly greater than that encoun-tered in metropolitan area commuting. A determination may only be made on an individual location basis. (b) Except when the criteria in para- graph (a)(2) or (3) of this section are met, the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met: (1) When the duty post is within the boundary of a metropolitan area, a de-veloped urban area, or community of sufficient size to provide adequate con-sumer facilities; and (2) When the duty post is within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the center of, or other appropriate point for large cit-ies or areas, a metropolitan area, a de-veloped urban area, or community of sufficient size to provide adequate con-sumer facilities. (This generally ex-cludes a post of duty within 80 kilo-meters (50 miles) of any city of 5,000 or more population.) (c) A determination of remoteness for a duty post outside the 50 United States will be made on an individual location basis, taking into consider-ation the distance, time, and com-muting conditions, and the extent to which these factors result in signifi-cant expense, inconvenience, or hard-ship. [44 FR 55134, Sept. 25, 1979, as amended at 58 FR 32278, June 9, 1993] § 591.305 Allowance rates. (a) General. An allowance rate may not exceed $10 a day. An allowance rate shall be established for each post of duty determined to be remote under §591.304, and shall be terminated or ad-justed as warranted. In determining the amount of the allowance rate, the following shall be considered: (1) Transportation expenses incurred in commuting to the remote post of duty as compared to transportation ex-penses (including cost of public trans- portation service) representative of those incurred in metropolitan areas within the United States or overseas as appropriate as periodically determined by the Office of Personnel Manage-ment. (2) Expenses incurred for lodging, meals, other services, and miscella-neous expenses when it is not feasible for an employee to commute daily as at duty posts determined under §591.304(a)(2). (3) Inconvenience or hardship associ- ated with commuting to the remote duty post taking into account such fac-tors as travel time, road conditions and', '......................... Odd.

Subpart G—Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP) for Displaced Employ-ees § 330.701 Purpose. The Interagency Career Transition Assistance Program (ICTAP) provides eligible displaced Federal employees with interagency selection priority for vacancies in agencies that are filling positions from outside their respective permanent competitive service workforces. The ICTAP selection pri-ority does not apply in the ICTAP eli-gible’s current or former agency and it does not prohibit movement of perma-nent competitive service employees within an agency, as permitted by sub-part F of this part. This subpart estab-lishes requirements for ICTAP selec-tion priority. § 330.702 Definitions. In this subpart: Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. Displaced describes an individual in one of the following categories: (1) A current career or career-condi- tional (tenure group I or II) competi-tive service employee of any agency at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below whose current performance rating of record is at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent and who: (i) Received a reduction in force (RIF) separation notice under part 351 VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00241 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR232 5 CFR Ch.

(2) A former career or career-condi- tional (tenure group I or II) competi-tive service employee of any agency at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below whose last performance rating of record was at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent who was either: (i) Separated by RIF under part 351 of this chapter and did not decline an offer under part 351, subpart G, of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and a represent-ative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee was separated; or (ii) Removed under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geo-graphic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reas-signment or a change in duty station). (3) A former career or career-condi- tional employee of any agency who was separated because of a compensable work-related injury or illness as pro-vided under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, sub-chapter I, whose compensation was ter-minated and who has received certifi-cation from the former employing agency that it is unable to place the employee as required by part 353 of this chapter. (4) A former career or career-condi- tional (tenure group I or II) competi-tive service employee of any agency who retired with a disability annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8337 or 8451 and who has received notification from OPM that the disability annuity has been or will be terminated. (5) A former Military Reserve Tech- nician or National Guard Technician receiving a special disability retire-ment annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) or 8456 and who has certification of such annuity from the military department or National Guard Bureau. (6) A current or former excepted serv- ice employee on an appointment with-out time limit at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below whose current or last performance rating of record is or was at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent and who: (i) Has been provided by law with both noncompetitive appointment eli-gibility and selection priority for com-petitive service positions; and (ii) Has received a RIF separation no- tice under part 351 of this chapter or notice of proposed removal under part 752 of this chapter for declining a di-rected geographic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a di-rected reassignment or a change in duty station) or has been separated by RIF procedures or removed for declin-ing a geographic relocation outside the local commuting area. ICTAP eligible means an individual who meets the definition of displaced. As used in this subpart, ‘‘ICTAP eligi-ble’’ and ‘‘eligible’’ are synonymous. ICTAP selection priority candidate means an ICTAP eligible who applied for a vacancy, was determined by the agency to be well-qualified for that va-cancy, and who the agency must select over any other candidate from outside the agency’s current competitive serv-ice workforce for the vacancy, unless the action to be taken is listed as an exception under §330.707. Vacancy means a vacant competitive service position at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below to be filled for 121 days or more, including extensions. § 330.703 Agency responsibilities for deciding who is well-qualified. (a) Agencies must define ‘‘well-quali- fied’’ for their specific vacancies, con-sistent with this subpart, and uni-formly apply that definition to all ICTAP eligibles being considered for the vacancy. (b) Agencies must conduct an inde- pendent second review and document the specific job-related reasons when-ever an ICTAP eligible is determined to be not well-qualified for the vacancy under the agency’s definition. An agen-cy must give the ICTAP eligible the written results of this review as re-quired by §330.706(d).

(a) At a minimum, agencies must de- fine ‘‘well-qualified’’ as having knowl-edge, skills, abilities, and/or com-petencies clearly exceeding the min-imum qualification requirements for the vacancy. The agency definition may or may not equate to the highly or best qualified assessment criteria established for the vacancy; however, the agency definition of ‘‘well-quali-fied’’ must satisfy the criteria in para-graph (b) of this section. (b) Under an agency’s definition of ‘‘well-qualified,’’ the agency must be able to determine whether an ICTAP eligible: (1) Meets the basic eligibility re- quirements (including employment suitability requirements under part 731 of this chapter and any medical quali-fication requirements), qualification standards (including minimum edu-cational and experience requirements), and any applicable selective factors; (2) Is physically qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential duties of the po-sition; (3) Meets any special qualifying con- ditions of the position; (4) Is able to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position upon entry; and (5) At agency discretion, either: (i) Rates at or above specified level(s) on all quality ranking factors; or (ii) Rates above minimally qualified in the agency’s', 'June 30, 1994, is subject to the statute of limita-tions contained in the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, as amended (section 255a of title 29, United States Code), which im-poses a 2-year statute of limitations, except in cases of a willful violation where the statute of limitations is 3 years. In deciding a claim, a deter-mination must be made as to whether the cause or basis of the claim was the result of a willful violation on the part of the agency. (c) Preserving the claim period. A claimant or a claimant’s designated representative may preserve the claim period by submitting a written claim either to the agency employing the claimant during the claim period or to OPM. The date the agency or OPM re-ceives the claim is the date that deter-mines the period of possible entitle-ment to back pay. The claimant is re-sponsible for proving when the claim was received by the agency or OPM and for retaining documentation to estab-lish when the claim was received by the agency or OPM, such as by filing the claim using certified, return re-ceipt mail, or by requesting that the agency or OPM provide written ac-knowledgment of receipt of the claim. If a claim for back pay is established, the claimant will be entitled to pay for a period of up to 2 years (3 years for a willful violation) back from the date the claim was received. § 551.703 Avenues of review. (a) Negotiated grievance procedure (NGP) as exclusive administrative remedy. If at any time during the claim period, a claimant was a member of a bar-gaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement that did not spe-cifically exclude matters under the Act from the scope of the NGP, the claim-ant must use that NGP as the exclusive administrative remedy for all claims under the Act. There is no right to fur-ther administrative review by the agency or by OPM. The remaining sec-tions in this subpart (that is, §§551.704 through 551.710) do not apply to such employees. (b) Non-NGP administrative review by agency or OPM. A claimant may file a claim with the agency employing the claimant during the claim period or with OPM, but not both simulta-neously, regarding matters arising under the Act if, during the entire claim period, the claimant: (1) Was not a member of a bargaining unit, or (2) Was a member of a bargaining unit not covered by a collective bar-gaining agreement, or (3) Was a member of a bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement that specifically excluded matters under the Act from the scope of the NGP. (c) Judicial review. Nothing in this subpart limits the right of a claimant to bring an action in an appropriate United States court. Filing a claim with an agency or with OPM does not satisfy the statute of limitations gov-erning FLSA claims filed in court. OPM will not decide an FLSA claim that is in litigation. § 551.704 Claimant’s representative. A claimant may designate a rep- resentative to assist in preparing or presenting a claim. The claimant must designate the representative in writ-ing. A representative may not partici-pate in OPM interviews unless specifi-cally requested to do so by OPM. An agency may disallow a claimant’s rep-resentative who is a Federal employee in any of the following circumstances: (a) When the individual’s activities as a representative would cause a con-flict of interest or position; (b) When the designated representa- tive cannot be released from his or her official duties because of the priority needs of the Government; or (c) When the release of the des- ignated representative would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Govern-ment.

A claimant may file an FLSA claim with either the agency employing the claimant during the claim period or with OPM, but a claimant cannot pursue the same claim with both at the same time. OPM encourages a claimant to obtain a deci-sion on the claim from the agency be-fore filing the claim with OPM. How-ever, this is a matter of personal dis-cretion and a claimant is not required to do this; a claimant may use either avenue. A claimant who receives an un-favorable decision on a claim from the agency may still file the claim with OPM. However, a claimant may not file the claim with the agency after receiv-ing an unfavorable decision from OPM. An OPM decision on a claim is final and is not subject to further adminis-trative review. (b) FLSA claim filed with agency. An FLSA claim filed with an agency should be made according to appro-priate agency procedures. At the re-quest of the claimant, the agency may forward the claim to OPM on the claimant’s behalf. The claimant is re-sponsible for ensuring that OPM re-ceives all the information requested in paragraph (c) of this section. (c) FLSA claim filed with OPM. An FLSA claim filed with OPM must be made in writing and must be signed by the claimant or the claimant’s rep-resentative. Relevant information may be submitted to OPM at any time fol-lowing the initial submission of a claim to OPM and prior to OPM’s deci-sion on the claim. The claim must in-clude the following: (1) The identity of the claimant (see §551.706(a)(2) regarding requesting con-fidentiality) and any designated rep-resentative, the agency employing the claimant during the claim period, the position (job title, series, and grade, or equivalent level) occupied by the claimant during the claim period, and the current mailing address, commer-cial telephone number, and facsimile machine number, if available, of the claimant and any designated represent-ative; (2) A description of the nature of the claim and the specific issues or inci-dents giving rise to the claim, includ-ing the time period covered by the claim; (3) A description of actions taken by the claimant to resolve the claim with-in the agency and the results of any ac-tions taken; (4) A copy of any relevant decision or written response by the agency; (5) Evidence available to the claim- ant or the claimant’s designated rep-resentative which supports the claim, including the identity, commercial telephone number, and location of other individuals who may be able to provide information relating to the claim; (6) The remedy sought by the claim- ant; (7) Evidence, if available, that the claim period was preserved in accord-ance with §551.702.

It addresses a specific aspect of compensation and benefits related to duty station assignments, which is directly covered under Title 5 CFR. The question is particularly useful for:

1. HR specialists who need to determine allowance eligibility
2. Federal employees working in potentially remote locations
3. Managers responsible for staffing and compensation planning
4. Budget and administrative personnel calculating employee compensation

The query demonstrates a nuanced understanding of federal employment policy by focusing on the specific criteria for defining a ""remote"" duty post. This suggests a genuine information need that goes beyond surface-level understanding and seeks precise regulatory interpretation. While not addressing a universally applicable topic, it represents a targeted inquiry that could have substantial implications for employees in specialized or geographically challenging assignments.

The technical nature of the question indicates a sophisticated approach to understanding federal employment regulations, making it valuable for professionals who need precise guidance on compensation and duty station classifications."
 What conditions must an employee meet to be eligible for severance pay under 5 CFR § 550.704?," To be eligible for severance pay, an employee must simultaneously meet three key requirements:
1. Be serving under a qualifying appointment

3. Be removed from Federal service by involuntary separation

An employee is NOT eligible for severance pay if they:

In addition, when an employee is separated because he or she declines to accept reassign-ment outside his or her commuting area, the separation is ‘‘involuntary’’ if the employee’s position description or other written agreement does not pro-vide for such a reassignment. However, an employee’s separation is not ‘‘in-voluntary’’ if, after such a written mo-bility agreement is added, the em-ployee accepts one reassignment out-side his or her commuting area, but subsequently declines another such re-assignment.

(b) Definitions —(1) Active duty means full-time duty in the armed forces, in-cluding full-time National Guard duty, except that for Reserve Component members the term ‘‘active duty’’ does not include training duties or attend-ance at service schools. (2) Armed forces has the meaning given that term in 10 U.S.C. 101. (3) Duty station means the permanent location to which a member of the armed forces is assigned for duty as specified on the individual’s permanent change of station (PCS) orders. (4) Member of the armed forces or serv- ice member means an individual who: (i) Is serving on active duty in the armed forces or serving under orders specifying the individual is called or ordered to active duty for more than 180 consecutive days; (ii) Retired or was released or dis- charged from active duty in the armed forces and has a disability rating of 100 percent as documented by the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs; or (iii) Was killed while serving on ac- tive duty in the armed forces.

(b) This subpart does not apply to any employee who is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. [70 FR 31301, May 31, 2005] § 531.403 Definitions. In this subpart: Acceptable level of competence means performance by an employee that war-rants advancement of the employee’s rate of basic pay to the next higher step of the grade or the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in this section) of his or her position, sub-ject to the requirements of §531.404 of this subpart, as determined by the head of the agency (or designee). Agency means an agency with em- ployees covered by this subpart, as pro-vided in §531.402. Calendar week means a period of any seven consecutive calendar days. Critical element has the meaning given that term in §430.203 of this chapter. Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that for the purpose of applying the provisions regarding equivalent increases and creditable service with respect to non- GS service, employee also includes— (1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and (2) An individual employed by a non- appropriated fund instrumentality for service that is creditable under §531.406(b)(4). Equivalent increase means an increase in an employee’s rate of basic pay, or an opportunity for such an increase under a non-GS pay system, as de-scribed in §531.407. General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. The term also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. GM employee has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203. GS rate means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding additional pay of any kind such as lo-cality payments under subpart F of this part and special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455. A rate payable to a GM em-ployee is considered a GS rate. Law enforcement officer or LEO has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103. LEO special base rate means a special base rate established for GS law en-forcement officers at grades GS–3 through GS–10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101– 509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate. Next higher rate within the grade for a GM employee means the rate of basic pay that exceeds the employee’s exist-ing rate of basic pay by one within- grade increase, not to exceed the max-imum rate of the grade. For the pur-pose of this definition, a within-grade increase equals the dollar value of the GS within-grade increase for the appli-cable grade (excluding any locality payment, special rate supplement, or any other additional payment). Permanent position means a position filled by an employee whose appoint-ment is not designated as temporary by law and does not have a definite time limitation of one year or less.

Promotion means an employee’s movement from one grade or level to a higher grade or level while continu-ously employed (including such a movement in conjunction with a trans-fer). Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position held by an em-ployee before any deductions and ex-clusive of additional pay of any kind.

It directly addresses a critical aspect of federal employment regulations related to severance pay, which is a key concern for employees facing potential job loss, HR specialists managing workforce transitions, and managers dealing with organizational restructuring. 

The question targets a specific section of the Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR § 550.704) that outlines precise conditions for severance pay eligibility. This makes it extremely practical and relevant for:

1. Federal employees who may be at risk of involuntary separation
2. HR professionals responsible for processing separation benefits
3. Managers involved in workforce reduction or reorganization
4. Legal professionals interpreting employment regulations
5. Employees seeking to understand their rights and potential financial protections

The technical nature of the question demonstrates a serious, substantive information need about a complex area of federal employment law. Understanding severance pay conditions is crucial for financial planning, career management, and ensuring fair treatment during workforce changes. The specificity of referencing the exact CFR section further enhances its value by pointing to the precise regulatory source.

This type of question provides actionable, precise information that can help federal employees and HR professionals navigate potentially challenging employment transitions with clarity and confidence."

(l) If the authority head decides that the defendant’s failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such de-cision. § 185.111 Referral of complaint and an- swer to the ALJ. Upon receipt of an answer, the re- viewing official shall file the complaint and answer with the ALJ. § 185.112 Notice of hearing. (a) When the ALJ receives the com- plaint and answer, the ALJ shall promptly serve a notice of hearing upon the defendant in the manner pre-scribed by §185.108. At the same time, the ALJ shall send a copy of such no-tice to the reviewing official or his or her designee. (b) Such notice shall include: (1) The tentative time and place, and the nature of the hearing; (2) The legal authority and jurisdic- tion under which the hearing is to be held; (3) The matters of fact and law to be asserted; (4) A description of the procedures for the conduct of the hearing; (5) The name, address, and telephone number of the representative of the Government and of the defendant, if any;', 'employee (or job candidate) has an outstanding student loan that qualifies for repayment under this part. The agency must verify remain-ing balances to ensure that loans are not overpaid. (2) The agency may repay more than one loan if the employee’s student loan repayment benefit does not exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. (3) These regulations do not impose a limit on the age of a student loan for qualification purposes. The agency may, however, specify in its agency plan that only student loans made within a certain timeframe are eligible for repayment. (c) Benefit amount. (1) In determining the amount of student loan repayment benefits to approve, an agency must consider the employee’s (or job can-didate’s) value to the agency and how far in advance the agency is permitted to commit funds. If an agency decides to make additional student loan repay-ment benefits contingent on budget levels or other factors, it must address these contingent benefits in the writ- ten service agreement as described in §537.107(a). (2) The amount of student loan re- payment benefits provided by an agen-cy is subject to both of the following limits: (i) $10,000 per employee per calendar year; and (ii) A total of $60,000 per employee. (3) In applying the limits in para- graph (c)(2) of this section, the agency must count the full student loan repay-ment benefit ( i.e., before deducting any tax withholdings as described in para-graph (a)(6)(iii) of this section). (d) Employee responsibility. Loan pay- ments made by an agency under this part do not exempt an employee from his or her responsibility and/or liabil-ity for any loan(s) the individual has taken out. The employee also is re-sponsible for any income tax obliga-tions resulting from the student loan repayment benefit. § 537.107 Service agreements. (a) Before an employing agency makes any loan payments for an em-ployee, the employee (or job candidate) must sign a written service agreement to complete a specified period of serv-ice with the agency and to reimburse the agency for the student loan repay-ment benefit when required by §537.109. The service agreement also may speci-fy any other employment conditions the agency considers to be appropriate, including the employee’s (or job can-didate’s) position and the duties he or she is expected to perform, his or her work schedule, his or her level of per-formance, and the geographic location of his or her position. (See §§537.108 and 537.109.) The service agreement may ad-dress the possibility that, during the period the agreement is in effect, the agency may modify the agreement to provide student loan repayment bene-fits in addition to those fixed in the agreement based on contingencies or conditions specified in the agreement. (b) The minimum period of service to be established under a service agree-ment is 3 years, regardless of the amount of student loan repayment ben-efits authorized.

Periods of leave without pay, or other periods during which the em-ployee is not in a pay status, do not count toward completion of the re-quired service period. Thus, the service completion date must be extended by the total amount of time spent in non- pay status. However, as provided by 5 CFR 353.107, absence because of uni-formed service or compensable injury is considered creditable toward the re-quired service period upon reemploy-ment. (c) A service agreement made under this part in no way constitutes a prom-ise of, or right or entitlement to, ap-pointment, continued employment, or noncompetitive conversion to the com-petitive service. This condition should be stated in the service agreement. (d) The service period begins on the date specified in the service agreement. That beginning date may not be— (1) Earlier than the date the service agreement is signed; or (2) Earlier than the date the indi- vidual begins serving in the position for which he or she was recruited (when student loan repayment benefits are approved to recruit a job candidate to fill an agency position). (e) The service agreement must con- tain a provision addressing whether the individual would be required to reim-burse the paying agency for student loan repayment benefits if he or she voluntarily separates from the paying agency to work for another agency be-fore the end of the service period. (See §537.109(b)(2).) (f) The agency may include in a serv- ice agreement specific conditions (in addition to those required by law) that trigger the loss of eligibility for stu-dent loan repayment benefits and/or a requirement that the employee reim-burse the agency for student loan re-payment benefits already received. (See §§537.108(a)(3) and 537.109(a)(2).) However, a service agreement may not require reimbursement based on— (1) An employee’s failure to maintain performance at a particular level (un-less the employee is separated based on unacceptable performance); or (2) An involuntary separation for rea- sons other than misconduct, unaccept-able performance, or a negative suit-ability determination under 5 CFR part 731 (e.g., an involuntary separation re-sulting from a reduction in force or medical reasons). § 537.108 Loss of eligibility for student loan repayment benefits. (a) An employee receiving student loan repayment benefits from an agen-cy is ineligible for continued benefits from that agency if the employee— (1) Separates from the agency; (2) Does not maintain an acceptable level of performance, as determined under standards and procedures pre-scribed by the agency; or (3) Violates a condition in the service agreement, if the agreement specifi-cally provides that eligibility is lost when the condition is violated. (b) For the purpose of applying para- graph (a)(2) of this section, an accept-able level of performance is one that is equivalent to level 3 (‘‘Fully Success-ful’’ or equivalent) or higher, as de-scribed in 5 CFR 430.208(d). An em-ployee loses eligibility for student loan repayment benefits if his or her most recent official performance evaluation does not meet this requirement. § 537.109 Employee reimbursements to the Government. (a) An employee is indebted to the Federal Government and must reim-burse the paying agency for the amount of any student loan repayment benefits received under a service agree-ment if he or she— (1) Fails to complete the period of service required in the applicable serv-ice agreement (except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section); or (2)', 'rate for each appro-priated fund survey job having at least 10 unweighed matches and for each nonappropriated fund job having at least 5 unweighed matches. The weighted average rates shall be com-puted using the survey job data col-lected in accordance with §§532.235 and 532.247 and the establishment weight. (2)(i) Incentive and piece-work rates shall be excluded when computing weighted average rates if, after estab-lishment weights have been applied, 90 percent or more of the total usable wage survey data reflect rates paid on a straight-time basis only. (ii) When sufficient incentive and piece-work rate data are obtained, the full incentive rate shall be used in computing the job weighted average rate when it is equal to or less than the average nonincentive rate. If the full incentive rate is greater than the aver-age nonincentive rate, the incentive rate shall be discounted by 15 percent. The discounted incentive rate shall be compared with the guaranteed min-imum rate and the average nonincen-tive rate, and the highest rate shall be used in computing the job weighted av-erage rate. (b) The lead agency shall compute paylines using the weighted average rates computed under paragraph (a) of this section. (1) The lead agency shall compute unit and frequency paylines using the straight-line, least squares regression formula: Y = a + bx, where Y is the hourly rate, x is grade, a is the inter-cept of the payline with the Y-axis, and b is the slope of the payline. (i) The unit payline shall be com- puted using a weight of one for each of the usable survey jobs and the weight-ed average rates identified and com-puted under paragraph (a) of this sec-tion. (ii) The frequency payline shall be computed using a weight equal to the number of weighted matches for each of the usable survey jobs and the weighted average rates identified and computed under paragraph (a) of this section. (2) Either or both of the lines com- puted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be recomputed after eliminating survey job data that cause distortion in the lines. (3) The lead agency may compute midpoint paylines using the following formula: Y = (a u+ a f)/2 + ((b u+ b f)/2)x, where Y is the hourly rate, x is the grade, a uis the intercept of the unit payline, a fis the intercept of the fre- quency payline, b uis the slope of the unit payline, and b fis the slope of the frequency payline. A midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on all of the usable survey job data as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and a second midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on limited survey job data authorized in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (4) The lead agency may compute other paylines for the purpose of insti-tuting changes in the scope of the sur-vey. (c) Usable data obtained from a par- ticular establishment may not be modified or deleted in order to reduce the effect of an establishment’s rates on survey findings, i.e., data will not be deleted or modified to avoid establish-ment domination.

" What key factors must be considered when conducting a job analysis for federal employment practices?
"," According to §300.103, a job analysis must identify three critical elements: (1) The basic duties and responsibilities of the position, (2) The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform those duties, and (3) The factors important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis can cover a single position, group of positions, or an entire occupation with common characteristics.","['generally, and of individual agencies, shall be based on a job analysis to iden-tify: (1) The basic duties and responsibil- ities; (2) The knowledges, skills, and abili- ties required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis may cover a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common charac-teristics. (b) Relevance. (1) There shall be a ra- tional relationship between perform-ance in the position to be filled (or in the target position in the case of an entry position) and the employment practice used. The demonstration of ra-tional relationship shall include a showing that the employment practice was professionally developed. A min-imum educational requirement may not be established except as authorized under section 3308 of title 5, United States Code. (2) In the case of an entry position the required relevance may be based upon the target position when— (i) The entry position is a training position or the first of a progressive se-ries of established training and devel-opment positions leading to a target position at a higher level; and (ii) New employees, within a reason- able period of time and in the great majority of cases, can expect to progress to a target position at a high-er level. (c) Equal employment opportunity and prohibited forms of discrimination. An employment practice must not dis-criminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amend-ed), disability, genetic information (in-cluding family medical history), mar-ital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affili-ation or nonaffiliation, status as a par-ent, or any other non-merit-based fac-tor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumer-ated above, where retaliation rights are available.

(a) The amount of the comparability allowance payable for each category of physician positions established under §595.103 must be the minimum amount necessary to deal with the recruitment and retention problem identified under §595.104 for that category of positions. In determining this amount, the agen-cy head must consider the relative earnings, responsibilities, expenses, workload, working conditions, condi-tions of employment, and personnel benefits for physicians in each cat-egory and for comparable physicians inside and outside the Federal Govern-ment. (b) Agencies may not pay a physi- cians’ comparability allowance in ex-cess of $14,000 annually to a physician with 24 months or less of service as a Government physician. Agencies may not pay a physicians’ comparability al-lowance in excess of $30,000 annually to a physician with more than 24 months of service as a Government physician. (c) In determining length of service as a Government physician, agencies must exclude periods of leave without pay. However, agencies may credit any prior service as a Government physi-cian, including— (1) Prior service as a physician under sections 7401 and 7405 of title 38, United States Code; and (2) Prior active service as a medical officer in the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service under title II of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. chapter 6A). (d) A physician who is employed on a regularly scheduled part-time basis of half-time or more is eligible to receive a physicians’ comparability allowance, but any such allowance must be pro-rated according to the proportion of the physicians’ work schedule to full- time employment. A physician who is employed on less than a half-time or intermittent basis is excluded from the physicians’ comparability allowance program.

Job analysis is a critical process for establishing position classifications, determining pay grades, developing performance standards, and ensuring fair hiring and promotion practices. 

The question addresses several important aspects of Title 5 regulations:
1. Position Classification: Directly relates to how federal jobs are structured and evaluated
2. Human Resources Management: Crucial for HR specialists in recruiting, hiring, and performance management
3. Organizational Effectiveness: Helps managers understand how to accurately define job roles and responsibilities

The question would be particularly useful for:
- HR specialists involved in job design and recruitment
- Managers seeking to understand position requirements
- Federal employees interested in career development
- Organizational development professionals

While not addressing a specific narrow regulation, the question explores a fundamental process that underpins many Title 5 employment practices. It requires a comprehensive understanding of federal employment standards, job classification systems, and the legal and procedural frameworks that govern federal workforce management.

The broad nature of the question makes it applicable across different federal agencies and employment contexts, which increases its practical value for a wide range of stakeholders."

Amounts', 'is between GS step rates, apply the fol-lowing method: Step A Using the rates and ranges in effect immediately before the annual pay adjustment, find the dif- ference between the GM employee’s GS rate and the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee’s grade. Step B Find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the GS rate range in effect im-mediately before the annual pay adjustment. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation in 5 U.S.C. 5303(f), use the uncapped maximum rate.) Step C Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the employee’s relative position in the rate range. Step D Using rates and ranges in effect after the annual pay adjustment, find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the new GS rate range for the employee’s grade. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped max-imum rate.) Step E Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived from step C. Step F Add the result from step E to the minimum rate of the employee’s current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. The resulting rate is the GM employee’s new GS rate (subject to the EX level V pay limitation).

Locality rates and special rates are computed for GM employees in the same manner as locality rates and spe-cial rates for other GS employees. The applicable locality payment or special rate supplement is added on top of the GM employee’s GS rate. § 531.246 Within-grade increases for GM employees. GM employees are entitled to within- grade increases as provided under sub-part D of this part. A within-grade in-crease may not cause a GM employee’s GS rate to exceed the maximum GS rate of his or her grade. GM employees may receive quality step increases as provided in subpart E of this part. [73 FR 66153, Nov. 7, 2008] § 531.247 Maximum payable rate rule for GM employees. (a) A rate received by a GM employee may qualify as a highest previous rate under §531.222. (b) As provided in §§531.221(a) and 531.241(b), if an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a trans-fer, promotion, demotion, or reassign-ment to a position in which the em-ployee will no longer be a supervisor or management official, and if the em-ploying agency after the action chooses to apply the maximum payable rate rule, the agency must follow the rules in §531.221. (c) If an employee retains GM status after an action that allows application of the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221 to set the employee’s pay, the rules in §531.221 must be applied in ac-cordance with the following special provisions: (1) In comparing the employee’s high- est previous rate to an applicable rate range for the grade in which pay is being set, do not identify the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate. Instead, identify the rate in the rate range that equals the highest previous rate unless that highest previous rate is below the range minimum or above the range maximum. If the highest previous rate is below the range minimum, identify the minimum rate (step 1) of the grade. If the highest previous rate is above the range maximum, identify the max-imum rate (step 10) of the grade. (2) In applying §531.221(b) for an em- ployee whose highest previous rate is a GS rate, the highest previous rate must be compared to the GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00433 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR424 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 531.401 being set, but which was in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. If the highest previous rate was earned while the current GS rate range was in effect, the rate identified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the maximum payable GS rate. Otherwise, based on the rate identified in para-graph (c)(1) of this section, the agency must determine the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently being set. That corresponding rate is the maximum payable GS rate. If the high-est previous rate was above the range minimum and below the range max-imum, the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range must be derived as follows: Step A ........... Find the difference between the employee’s highest previous rate and the minimum rate for the GS rate range (for the employ-ee’s current grade) in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. Step B ............ Find the difference between the maximum rate and the min- imum GS rate for the rate range identified in step A. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped maximum rate.) Step C ............ Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the em-ployee’s relative position in the rate range. Step D ........... Using the current GS rate range (for the employee’s current grade), find the difference between the maximum rate and the minimum rate. (If the maximum GS rate was not payable be-cause of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped max-imum GS rate.) Step E ............ Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived under step C. Step F ............ Add the result from step E to the minimum rate for the employ- ee’s current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate the agency may pay the employee (subject to the EX level V pay limita-tion). (3) In applying §531.221(c) for an em- ployee whose highest previous rate is a special rate, the highest previous rate (after any geographic conversion) must be compared directly to the current highest applicable rate range for the employee’s position of record and offi-cial worksite after reassignment. Thus, the rate identified under paragraph (c)(1)', '14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00789 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR780 5 CFR Ch.

(a) Application. When the foreign ex- emption applies, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply to any employee who spends all hours of work in a given workweek in an exempt area. When an employee meets one of the two criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the for-eign exemption applies until the em-ployee spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area as defined in §551.104. (b) Foreign exemption applies. If an employee meets one of the two fol-lowing criteria, the employee is subject to the foreign exemption of the Act and the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply: (1) The employee is permanently sta- tioned in an exempt area and spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas; or (2) The employee is not permanently stationed in an exempt area, but spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas. (c) Foreign exemption does not apply. For any given workweek, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provi-sions of the Act apply to an employee permanently stationed in an exempt area who spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area. For that work-week, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption, and the agency must determine the exemption status of such an employee as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this sec-tion. The foreign exemption does not resume until the employee again meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. (1) Same duties. If the duties per- formed during that workweek are con-sistent with the primary duties of the employee’s official position, the agency must designate the employee the same FLSA exemption status as if the em-ployee were permanently stationed in any nonexempt area. (2) Different duties. If the duties per- formed during that workweek are not consistent with the primary duties of the employee’s official position: (i) The agency must first designate the employee the same FLSA exemp- tion status as the employee would have been designated based on the duties in-cluded in the employee’s official posi-tion if the employee was permanently stationed in any nonexempt area; and (ii) The agency must determine the employee’s exemption status for that workweek by applying §551.211. (d) Resumption of foreign exemption. When an employee returns to any ex-empt area from performing any hours of work in any nonexempt area, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption until the employee meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. § 551.213 Exemption of employees re- ceiving availability pay. The following employees are exempt from the hours of work and overtime pay provisions of the Act: (a) A criminal investigator receiving availability pay under §550.181(a) of this chapter, as provided in 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(16)); (b) A pilot employed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection or its successor who is a law enforcement officer as de-fined in section 5541(3) of title 5, United States Code, and who receives avail-ability pay under section 5545a(i) of title 5, United States Code. § 551.214 Statutory exclusion. A customs officer who receives over- time pay under subsection (a) or pre-mium pay under subsection (b) of 19 U.S.C. 267 and under 19 CFR 24.16 for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law. § 551.215 Fire protection activities and 7(k) coverage for FLSA pay and ex-emption determinations. (a) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may determine that the provi-sions of section 7(k) of the Act apply to certain categories of fire protection employees based on appropriate fac-tors, such as the type of premium pay-ments they receive (see §551.501(a)(1) and (5) and §551.541).

Fire pro- tection activities involve the perform-ance of functions directly concerned with the response to and the control and extinguishment of fires; or per-formance of inspection of facilities and equipment for the primary purpose of reducing or eliminating fire hazards by trained firefighters eligible for reas-signment to fire control and suppres-sion or prevention duties; or provision of the primary ( i.e., the first called) rescue and ambulance service in con-nection with fire protection functions. (c) Engaged in fire protection activities. (1) An employee (including a fire-fighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, rescue worker, ambulance personnel, or hazardous materials worker) is considered engaged in fire protection activities for the purpose of determining possible application of section 7(k) of the Act as provided for in §551.501(a)(1) and (5) and §551.541 if the employee: (i) Is trained in fire suppression, has authority and responsibility to engage in fire suppression, and is employed by an organization with fire suppression as a primary mission; and (ii) Is engaged in the prevention, con- trol, and extinguishment of fires or re-sponse to emergency situations where life, property, or the environment is at risk. (2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the fol-lowing types of employees are engaged in fire protection activities for the pur-pose of determining possible applica-tion of section 7(k) of the Act: (i) Employees in positions properly classified in the Fire Protection and Prevention series, including any quali-fied firefighter who is assigned to per-form support functions (e.g., commu-nications or dispatching functions, equipment maintenance or repair) or who is transferred to an administrative or supervisory position within the fire protection activity, except when such administrative or supervisory work ex-empts the employee under executive, administrative, and professional con-siderations; (ii) Employees in positions properly classified in other series, such as For-estry Technician, for whom fire protec-tion functions constitute substantially full-time assignments throughout the year, or for the duration of a specified fire season within the year; (iii) Temporary employees hired sole- ly to perform fire suppression work on an as-needed basis; (iv) Members of rescue and ambu- lance crews with fire suppression train-ing, authority, and responsibility, who are part of a fire suppression organiza-tion, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section; and (v) Any other employee in any work- week in which the employee performs fire control or suppression work for 80 percent or more of the total hours worked. (d) Not engaged in fire protection activi- ties. Examples of types of', 'adjusted by NAF instru-mentalities on an annual basis and at such additional times as new or revised minimum wage statutes require. The amount of any tip offset may vary within a single instrumentality based on location, type of service, or time of service. (d) If tipped employees are rep- resented by a labor organization hold-ing exclusive recognition, the employ-ing NAF instrumentality shall nego-tiate with such organization to arrive at a determination as to whether, when, and how much tip offset shall be applied. Changes in tip offset practices may be made more frequently than an-nually as a result of collective bar-gaining agreement. (e) Tip offset practices shall be gov- erned by the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, or the applicable statutes of the State, possession or territory where an employee works, whichever provides the greater benefit to the em-ployee. In locations where tip offset is prohibited by law, the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply. [55 FR 46146, Nov. 1, 1990] § 532.285 Special wage schedules for supervisors of negotiated rate Bu-reau of Reclamation employees. (a) The Department of the Interior shall establish and issue special wage schedules for wage supervisors of nego-tiated rate wage employees in the Bu-reau of Reclamation. These schedules shall be based on annual special wage surveys conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation in each special wage area. Survey jobs representing Bureau of Reclamation positions at up to four levels will be matched to private indus-try jobs in each special wage area. Spe-cial schedule rates for each position will be based on prevailing rates for that particular job in private industry. (b) Each supervisory job shall be de- scribed at one of four levels cor-responding to the four supervisory sit-uations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. They shall be titled in accordance with regular FWS practices, with the added designation of level I, II, III, or IV. The special survey and wage schedule for a given special wage area includes only those occupations and levels having employees in that area. For each posi-tion on the special schedule, there shall be three step rates. Step 2 is the prevailing rate as determined by the survey; step 1 is 96 percent of the pre-vailing rate; and step 3 is 104 percent of the prevailing rate. (c) For each special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation shall designate and appoint a special wage survey com-mittee, including a chairperson and two other members (at least one of whom shall be a supervisor paid from the special wage schedule), and one or more two-person data collection teams (each of which shall include at least one supervisor paid from the special wage schedule). The local wage survey committee shall determine the pre-vailing rate for each survey job as a weighted average. Survey specifica-tions are as follows for all surveys: (1) Based on Bureau of Reclamation activities and types of supervisory po-sitions in the special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation must survey private industry companies, with no VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00474 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR465 Office of Personnel Management § 532.285 minimum employment size require- ment for establishments, in the fol-lowing North American Industry Clas- sification System code subsectors: 2022 NAICS codes 2022 NAICS industry titles 211 ..................................

(2) Each local wage survey com- mittee shall compile lists of all compa-nies in the survey area known to have potential job matches. For the first survey, all companies on the list will be surveyed. Subsequently, companies shall be removed from the survey list if they prove not to have job matches, and new companies will be added if they are expected to have job matches. Survey data will be shared with other local wage survey committees when the data from any one company is ap-plicable to more than one special wage area. (3) For each area, survey job descrip- tions shall be tailored to correspond to the position of each covered supervisor in that area. They will be described at one of four levels (I, II, III, or IV) cor-responding to the definitions of the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. A description of the craft, trade, or labor work supervised will be included in each supervisory survey job description.

It addresses a nuanced aspect of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exemption status that isn't immediately straightforward, particularly for federal employees working in mixed or transitional work environments.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of potential complications in federal employment classification, specifically:
1. Geographic variations in work assignments
2. Intersections between exempt and non-exempt work areas
3. Potential implications for wage and hour regulations

This type of inquiry would be particularly valuable for:
- HR compensation specialists
- Federal managers managing cross-location workforce
- Employees seeking clarity on their wage classification
- Labor relations professionals interpreting complex work arrangements

The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for precise regulatory interpretation, which is crucial in federal employment contexts where precise classification can significantly impact compensation and worker rights. While not a universally applicable question, it represents a sophisticated exploration of Title 5 and FLSA intersection that could have meaningful implications for specific federal employment scenarios."
 What mandatory exceptions exist when an agency is conducting a reduction in force (RIF) that could affect employee retention?," The policy identifies two key mandatory exceptions in §351.606:
1. Armed Forces Restoration Rights: Agencies must give retention priority to Group I or II employees entitled to retention under 38 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024 for 6 months or 1 year after restoration.
2. Use of Annual Leave for Retirement/Benefits Eligibility: An agency must temporarily retain an employee who is being involuntarily separated and elects to use annual leave to:
- Establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414
- Establish initial eligibility to continue health benefits coverage into retirement","['are tied for release from a competitive level, the agency may se-lect any tied employee for release.

(a) Each agency with positions sub- ject to this subpart must establish written procedures for setting the rate of basic pay and increasing the rate of basic pay of incumbents of the posi-tions in accordance with law and this subpart. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for mak-ing pay decisions, while assuring con-fidentiality. The agency’s plan for set-ting and increasing rates of basic pay must reflect meaningful distinctions among SL and ST employees based on individual performance, contribution to agency performance, or both, and must include— (1) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional’s rate of basic pay to ensure that indi-vidual pay rates or pay increases, as well as their overall distribution with-in the senior professional pay range, reflect meaningful distinctions within a single performance level (e.g., the higher the employee’s relative per-formance within a rating level, the higher the pay increase), between per-formance rating levels (e.g., the higher the rating level, the higher the pay in-crease), or both; (2) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional’s rate of basic pay at a rate that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if the applicable agency per-formance appraisal system has been certified under part 430, subpart D of this chapter; (3) Any system, methods, or criteria the agency uses to establish pay ranges applicable to various SL or ST posi-tions within the pay range that applies under §534.504(a), consistent with the requirement that pay be determined based upon individual performance, contributions to the agency’s perform-ance, or both; (4) The designation of the authorized agency official(s) who will have the au-thority to set and adjust rates of basic pay for SL and ST employees, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; and (5) The administrative and manage- ment controls that will be applied to assure compliance with applicable stat-utes, OPM regulations, the agency’s written procedures established under this section, the applicable maximum rate of basic pay in §534.504(a), and, where applicable, the certification re-quirements set forth in part 430, sub-part D of this chapter. In an agency that employs ten or more senior profes-sionals, these controls must include centralized review of ratings proposed under §430.208 of this chapter and pay actions proposed under §534.507 by a panel of individuals designated by the agency head to provide advice from an agency-wide perspective for authorized agency officials to consider before ap-proving pay adjustments on whether— (i) Ratings of record and performance ratings proposed for senior profes-sionals accurately reflect their indi-vidual performance, contributions to agency performance, or both, and take into account, as appropriate, assess-ment of the agency’s performance against program performance measures and other relevant considerations; and (ii) Proposed pay adjustments for senior professionals conform to the re-quirements of §534.507 and appro-priately correspond to proposed ratings of record and performance ratings.

A rate of basic pay equal to or above the amount derived using the following rules is considered to be within the highest 10 percent of the ap-plicable pay range (in 2015, $177,166 or above if the applicable system is cer-tified, or $164,026 or above if the appli-cable system is not certified or per-formance appraisal does not apply): (i) Subtract the minimum rate of basic pay from the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable rate range under §534.504 (in 2015, $183,300 ¥$121,956 = $61,344 if the applicable system is cer-tified, or $168,700 ¥$121,956 = $46,744 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply); (ii) Multiply the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by 0.10 (in 2015, $61,344 ¥ 0.10 = $6,134 if the applicable system is certified, or $46,744 ¥ 0.10 = $4,674 if the applicable system is not certified or performance ap-praisal does not apply); and (iii) Subtract the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the maximum rate of basic pay appli-cable under §534.504 (in 2015, $183,300 ¥$6,134 = $177,166 if the applica- ble system is certified, or $168,700 ¥$4,674 = $164,026 if the applica- ble system is not certified or perform-ance appraisal does not apply); (2) Any pay increase under §534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the SL or ST em-ployee’s rate of basic pay as in effect on the', 'lower-paid special rate po-sition from a special rate position; (4) A management action that places an employee under a different pay schedule; (5) A management action that places an employee in a formal employee de-velopment program generally utilized Governmentwide (e.g., Recent Grad-uates Program); or (6) A reduction or elimination of scheduled rates, special schedules, or special rate schedules, excluding— (i) A statutory reduction in sched- uled rates of pay under the General Schedule, including a reduction au-thorized under 5 U.S.C. 5303(b); or (ii) A statutory reduction in a pre- vailing rate schedule established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, and 5 CFR part 532. (b) An agency must establish a re- tained rate when application of a pro-motion increase rule for General Schedule or prevailing rate employees results in a payable rate of basic pay that exceeds the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee’s new position. (See the pro-motion increase rules in 5 U.S.C. 5334(b) and 5 CFR 531.214 for GS em-ployees and in 5 CFR 532.407 for pre-vailing rate employees—in particular, the special provisions in these pro-motion increase rules on establishing a retained rate equal to an employee’s existing rate when that existing rate exceeds the applicable range max-imum.) Once established, such a re-tained rate is governed by the provi-sions of this subpart. (c) If an employee’s official worksite changes in conjunction with an action that may entitle the employee to pay retention under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must apply the ge-ographic conversion rule in §536.303(a) before determining whether an employ-ee’s rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced. (d) An employee is considered ‘‘placed’’ under paragraph (a)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section only when the employee remains in a position in the same agency. Optional pay retention under §536.302 may apply when an em-ployee transfers to a different agency as a result of a reduction in force or re-classification action or is selected by a different agency to fill a position under a formal employee development pro-gram, if all other qualifying conditions are met.

(a) Subject to the requirements in §536.102 and this section, an authorized agency official may provide pay reten-tion to an employee not entitled to pay retention under §536.301, but whose payable rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced (after application of any applicable geographic conversion under §536.303(a)) as the result of a management action. This includes a management action to move an em-ployee’s position, without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a De-partment of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) to a posi-tion under a covered pay system in the same agency.

The agency must identify the highest applicable rate range that would apply to the employee’s position of record before the pay action as if that position were stationed at the new official worksite and determine the employee’s converted payable rate of basic pay based on the step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) in that range that corresponds to the employee’s step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) before the pay action. A reduction in an employ-ee’s payable rate of basic pay resulting from this geographic conversion is not a basis for entitlement to pay reten-tion. The pay retention rules in this subpart must be applied as if the em-ployee’s payable rate of basic pay after geographic conversion is the employ-ee’s existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the ac-tion. (b) Geographic conversion when a re- tained rate employee’s official worksite is changed. When an employee is receiv- ing a retained rate and the employee’s official worksite is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agency must apply the fol-lowing rules (after applying any simul-taneous general pay adjustment under §536.305) to derive the converted re-tained rate that will be used as the ex-isting retained rate in determining the employee’s pay retention entitlement in the new position of record and at the new official worksite: (1) Identify the maximum rate for the highest applicable rate range that ap-plies to the employee’s former position of record based on the former official worksite; (2) Identify the maximum rate for the highest applicable rate range that would apply to the employee’s former position of record if the employee were stationed at the official worksite for the new position of record; (3) Divide the maximum rate identi- fied in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the maximum rate identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and round the result to the fourth decimal place; and (4) Multiply the factor resulting from paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the employee’s former retained rate and round to the nearest whole dollar (for an annual rate) or the nearest whole cent (for an hourly rate) to derive the employee’s converted retained rate at the new official worksite.

(a) A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an appli-cant’s credit background of the sort asked on the OF–306, Declaration for Federal Employment, or other forms used to conduct suitability investiga-tions for Federal employment ( i.e., in- quiries into an applicant’s adverse credit history) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employ-ment to the applicant. Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant’s Se-lective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, where appli-cable, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of em- ployment to an applicant. (b) However, in certain situations, agencies may have a business need to obtain information about the credit background of applicants earlier in the hiring process to determine if they meet the qualifications requirements or are suitable for the position being filled. If so, agencies must request an exception from the Office of Personnel Management in order to determine an applicant’s ability to meet qualifica-tions or suitability for Federal employ-ment prior to making a conditional offer of employment to the appli-cant(s). OPM will grant exceptions only when the agency demonstrates specific job-related reasons why the agency needs to evaluate an applicant’s adverse credit history earlier in the process. OPM will consider such factors as, but not limited to, the nature of the position being filled and whether a clean credit history record would be es-sential to the ability to perform one of the duties of the position effectively. OPM may also consider positions for which the expense of completing the examination makes it appropriate to review an applicant’s credit back-ground at the outset of the process (e.g., a position that requires that an applicant complete a rigorous training regimen and pass an examination based VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00246 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR237 Office of Personnel Management § 332.301 upon the training before the appli- cant’s selection can be finalized).

The question directly addresses a critical aspect of Title 5 regulations concerning Reduction in Force (RIF) procedures, which is a complex and sensitive area of federal employment law. 

For HR specialists, this question is crucial as it relates to understanding mandatory retention exceptions during workforce restructuring. Managers need to comprehend these exceptions to ensure legal compliance and fair treatment of employees during organizational changes. Federal employees have a direct interest in understanding what protections might exist that could preserve their job status during a RIF.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the nuanced legal protections within federal employment regulations. It seeks to clarify the mandatory exceptions that could impact employee retention, which suggests a deep dive into the procedural safeguards built into federal workforce management policies.

Specific stakeholders who would find this question valuable include:
- HR professionals managing workforce reductions
- Federal managers planning organizational restructuring
- Employees potentially affected by RIF actions
- Labor relations specialists
- Employment law researchers

The question's technical specificity and focus on mandatory exceptions indicate a serious, professional-level inquiry into the complexities of federal employment regulations, making it highly valuable for anyone seeking comprehensive understanding of RIF procedures."
" During a national emergency, what special hiring authorities do federal agencies have for making appointments, and what are the key limitations?"," According to § 230.402, during a declared national emergency, agencies can make emergency-indefinite appointments with the following key provisions: (1) Appointments can be made without OPM approval; (2) Agencies must typically use appropriate registers of eligibles when possible; (3) Emergency-indefinite employees do not acquire competitive civil service status; (4) The first year is a trial period during which the agency can terminate the appointment; (5) Appointments can be continued for the duration of the emergency; and (6) Agencies can hire certain categories of persons noncompetitively, such as pre-recruited standby personnel, National Defense Executive Reserve members, and former federal employees eligible for reinstatement.","['Personnel Management, or under its supervision, to determine whether a specified change in personnel management poli-cies or procedures would result in im-proved Federal personnel management (5 U.S.C. 4701).

OPM will announce opportunities for research contracts by issuing Requests for Proposals (RFP’s) in accordance with Federal procurement regulations. Unsolicited proposals may be accepted; however the relevance of the proposed research to OPM research needs will determine the acceptability of the pro-posal. Subpart C—Regulatory Require- ments Pertaining to Dem-onstration Projects § 470.301 Program expectations. (a) Demonstration projects permit the Office of Personnel Management and Federal agencies to test alter-native personnel management concepts in controlled situations to determine the likely effects and ramifications of proposed changes before putting them into general effect. OPM will assist agencies, within available resources, in developing projects which demonstrate new or improved personnel methods. (b) The demonstration project must be proposed in a research context. The project plan must include a research design which contains: (1) Measurable goals or objectives; (2) Acceptable expected results or outcomes; (3) A description of the procedures, methods and techniques to be dem-onstrated in achieving the desired goals or objectives; (4) An evaluation section describing the data collection and analysis proce-dures to be used to assess the success or failure of the project from a quali-tative and quantitative standpoint; and (5) An itemization of all costs and benefits associated with the project, to the agency, the Government, and the community. (c) OPM may establish and maintain activities which publish, exchange and apply the results of demonstration projects. (d) OPM may seek legislation, or to the extent already authorized by law, make changes in regulation to imple-ment permanently successful proce-dures, techniques, new management knowledge, and materials which im-prove personnel management programs or techniques. § 470.303 Eligible parties. (a) Any Federal agency, or groups of two or more Federal agencies, eligible to propose demonstration projects under 5 U.S.C. 4701(a)(1) and 4701(b) may conduct demonstration projects after approval by the Office of Per-sonnel Management and required Con-gressional and public review. (b) While only a Federal agency may propose and conduct a demonstration project, the agency may be assisted in the development and evaluation of the project under contract or agreement with public or private institutions and organizations. § 470.305 Submission of proposals for demonstration projects. (a) OPM will accept project proposals at any time. However, OPM may delay action for a reasonable amount of time on submitted proposals until compari-sons can be made with other existing projects or with project proposals of a similar nature not yet received by OPM but known to be under develop-ment. (b) Agencies must submit the project proposal in the form of a project plan to OPM for approval. OPM will pre-scribe the content of a project plan in its guidance and instructions, which at a minimum will contain the items identified in 5 U.S.C. 4703(b)(1) and 5 CFR 470.301(b). (c) Agencies will outline, at the time proposed demonstration projects are submitted to OPM for approval, what discussions of the project have been held with labor organizations which have been accorded exclusive recogni-tion for bargaining units containing employees involved in or affected by the proposed demonstration project.

(c) Factors for authorizing a retention incentive for a group or category of em-ployees. (1) An agency must consider the factors in paragraph (b) of this sec-tion as they relate to determining whether a group or category of employ-ees— (i) Has unusually high or unique qualifications ( i.e., competencies) or that the agency has a special need for the employees’ services that makes it essential to retain the employees in that category; and (ii) That it is reasonable to presume that there is a high risk that a signifi-cant number of employees in the tar-geted category would be likely to leave the Federal service in the absence of a retention incentive. (2) An agency must narrowly define a targeted category of employees using factors that relate to the conditions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Factors that may be appro-priate include the following: occupa-tional series, grade level, distinctive job duties, unique competencies re-quired for the position, assignment to a special project, minimum agency serv-ice requirements, organization or team designation, geographic location, and required rating of record. (While a rat-ing of record of higher than the ‘‘Fully Successful’’ rating of record required by §575.305(d) may be a factor used in defining the targeted category, a rat-ing of record by itself is not sufficient to justify a', 'record (e.g., 5 CFR 531.206 for GS positions and 5 CFR 532.413 for Federal Wage System posi-tions).

(1) The effective date of a classification appellate cer-tificate or agency appellate decision can be retroactive only if it corrects a classification action which resulted in a loss of grade or pay. In order for the decision to be made retroactive, the employee must file the initial request for review with either the agency or the Office not later than 15 calendar days after the effective date of the re-classification action. (2) However, if the appellate decision raises the grade of the position above the original grade, retroactivity will apply only to the extent of restoration to the original grade. (3) The right to a retroactive effec- tive date provided by this section is preserved on subsequent appeals from an agency or Office classification deci-sion when the subsequent appeal is filed not later than 15 calendar days following receipt of written notifica-tion of a final agency administrative decision or 15 calendar days after the effective date of the action taken as a result of the classification decision, whichever is later. (c) Grade change based on new duties and responsibilities. Retroactivity may be based only on duties and responsibil-ities existing at the time of demotion and cannot be based on duties and re-sponsibilities assigned later. (d) Retroactivity when time limits are extended. The right to a retroactive ef- fective date provided by this section may be preserved at the discretion of the Office, on a showing by the em-ployee that he or she was not notified of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that cir-cumstances beyond his or her control prevented filing an appeal within the prescribed time limit.

A national emergency must meet all of the following condi- tions: (i) It was declared by the President or Congress. (ii) It involves a danger to the United States’ safety, security, or stability that results from specified cir-cumstances or conditions and that is national in scope. (iii) It requires a national program specifically intended to combat the threat to national safety, security, or stability. (2) Termination of a national emer- gency. A national emergency no longer exists if it is officially terminated by the President or Congress, or if the spe- cific circumstances, conditions, or pro- gram cited in the original declaration are terminated or corrected. (b) Basic authority. Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appoint-ments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM’s approval to make emergency-indefinite appoint-ments without a declared national emergency when the President has au-thorized the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must make emergency-indefi-nite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available eligibles. (c) Appointment under direct-hire au- thority. An agency may make emer- gency-indefinite appointments under this section using the direct-hire proce-dures in part 337 of this chapter. (d) Appointment noncompetitively. An agency may give emergency-indefinite appointments under this section to the following classes of persons without re-gard to registers of eligibles and the provisions in §332.102 of this chapter: (1) Persons who were recruited on a standby basis prior to the national emergency; (2) Members of the National Defense Executive Reserve, designated in ac-cordance with section 710(e) of the De-fense Production Act of 1950, Executive Order 11179 of September 22, 1964, and applications issued by the agency au-thorized to implement the law and Ex-ecutive Order; and (3) Former Federal employees eligi- ble for reinstatement. (e) Tenure of emergency-indefinite em- ployees. (1) Emergency-indefinite em- ployees do not acquire a competitive status on the basis of their emergency- indefinite appointments. (2) An emergency-indefinite appoint- ment may be continued for the dura-tion of the emergency for which it is made. (f) Trial period. (1) The first year of service of an emergency-indefinite em-ployee is a trial period. (2) The agency may terminate the ap- pointment of an emergency-indefinite employee at any time during the trial period. The employee is entitled to the procedures set forth in §315.804 or §315.805 of this chapter as appropriate. (g) Eligibility for within-grade in- creases. An emergency-indefinite em- ployee serving in a position subject to the General Schedule is eligible for within-grade increases in accordance with subpart D of part 531 of this chap-ter. (h) Applications of other regulations. (1) The term indefinite employee includes an emergency-indefinite employee or an employee under an emergency ap-pointment as used in the following: parts 351, 353 of this chapter, subpart G of part 550 of this chapter, and part 752 of this chapter. (2) The selection procedures of part 337 of this chapter apply to emergency- indefinite appointments that use the direct-hire authority under paragraph (c) of this section. (3) Despite the provisions in §831.201(a)(11) of this chapter, an em-ployee serving under an emergency-in-definite appointment under authority of this section is excluded from retire-ment coverage, except as provided in paragraph (b) of §831.201 of this chap-ter.

The question has high relevance to Title 5 and provides significant value for multiple stakeholders:

1. For HR Specialists: It directly addresses special hiring procedures during national emergencies, which requires precise understanding of legal authorities and limitations.

2. For Managers: Provides crucial guidance on workforce management strategies during crisis situations, helping them understand their legal options for rapid staffing.

3. For Federal Employees: Helps them understand potential changes to hiring and employment processes during national emergencies.

4. For Legal and Compliance Professionals: Offers insight into the intersection of emergency powers and standard employment regulations.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment policy, focusing on a complex scenario that requires specialized knowledge. It goes beyond routine employment questions by exploring exceptional circumstances where standard hiring rules may be modified.

The practical implications are significant, as national emergencies can dramatically alter workforce needs and hiring constraints. Understanding these special authorities helps organizations respond effectively while maintaining legal compliance.

The question's technical nature suggests it would be valuable for in-depth policy research, training, and preparedness planning across federal agencies."
" Under what circumstances can an employee's sleep and meal periods be excluded from hours of work, and are there any exceptions to this rule?
"," The policy provides nuanced guidelines for sleep and meal periods:
- Generally, bona fide sleep and meal periods are not considered hours of work
- Exceptions include:
  1. If a sleep or meal period is interrupted by a call to duty, that interruption time is considered hours of work
  2. For employees receiving annual premium pay for standby duty, sleep and meal periods during scheduled tours are considered hours of work
  3. For shifts of 24 hours or more, up to 8 hours of sleep/meal time can be excluded, but only if the employee had an uninterrupted 5-hour sleep opportunity
  4. For firefighters compensated under 5 U.S.C. 5545b, on-duty sleep and meal times cannot be excluded from hours of work","['a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine whether an employee’s travel is within or outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station for determining entitlement to overtime pay for travel under paragraph (g) of this section ex-cept that— (1) An agency’s definition of an em- ployee’s official duty station for deter-mining overtime pay for travel may not be smaller than the definition of ‘‘official station and post of duty’’ under the Federal Travel Regulation issued by the General Services Admin-istration (41 CFR 300–3.1); and (2) Travel from home to work and vice versa is not hours of work. When an employee travels directly from home to a temporary duty location outside the limits of his or her official duty station, the time the employee would have spent in normal home to work travel shall be deducted from hours of work. (k) Standby duty. (1) An employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-re-lated reasons, the employee is re-stricted by official order to a des-ignated post of duty and is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employ-ee’s activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effec-tively for his or her own purposes. A finding that an employee’s activities are substantially limited may not be based on the fact that an employee is subject to restrictions necessary to en-sure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and respon-sibilities, such as restrictions on alco-hol consumption or use of certain medications. (2) An employee is not considered re- stricted for ‘‘work-related reasons’’ if, for example, the employee remains at the post of duty voluntarily, or if the restriction is a natural result of geo-graphic isolation or the fact that the employee resides on the agency’s prem-ises. For example, in the case of an em-ployee assigned to work in a remote wildland area or on a ship, the fact that the employee has limited mobility when relieved from duty would not be a basis for finding that the employee is restricted for work-related reasons. (l) On-call status. An employee is off duty, and time spent in an on-call sta-tus is not hours of work if— (1) The employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or carry an elec-tronic device for the purpose of being contacted, even though the employee is required to remain within a reasonable call-back radius; or (2) The employee is allowed to make arrangements for another person to perform any work that may arise dur-ing the on-call period. (m) Sleep and meal time. (1) Bona fide sleep and meal periods may not be con-sidered hours of work, except as pro-vided in paragraphs (m)(2), (m)(3), and (m)(4) of this section. If a sleep or meal period is interrupted by a call to duty, the time spent on duty is hours of work. (2) Sleep and meal periods during reg- ularly scheduled tours of duty are hours of work for employees who re-ceive annual premium pay for regu-larly scheduled standby duty under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1). (3) When employees are assigned to work shifts of 24 hours or more during which they must remain within the confines of their duty station in a standby status, and for which they do not receive annual premium pay for regularly scheduled standby duty under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1), the amount of bona fide sleep and meal time excluded from hours of work may not exceed 8 hours in any 24-hour period. No sleep time may be excluded unless the em-ployee had the opportunity to have an uninterrupted period of at least 5 hours of sleep during the applicable sleep pe-riod.

An agency must include in its report to Congress and OPM any additional information required by OPM under this subsection. (k) Special provisions for Department of Defense.

(1) This paragraph applies to all SES career ap-pointees in the agency, including ap-pointees serving a probationary period. (2) An agency shall establish com- petitive procedures in writing to deter-mine who will be removed from the SES in any reduction in force of career appointees within the agency. Such competitive procedures shall be based primarily on performance. When per-formance ratings are used, they shall be the final ratings under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C. (3) An appointee who has completed the probationary period must be re-tained over an appointee who has not completed the probationary period if they both have the same retention standing. (4) Competitive procedures are not required if an agency is being abol-ished, without a transfer of functions, and all SES appointees will be sepa-rated at the same time or within 3 months of abolishment. (b) Placement within the agency. (1) This paragraph applies to any SES ca-reer appointee who has completed the probationary period, or was not re-quired to serve a probationary period, and who has been identified for reduc-tion in force under paragraph (a) of this section. (2) The appointee is entitled to be of- fered any vacant SES position in the agency for which the appointee meets the qualifications requirements. If there is more than one vacancy, the agency has the option of which posi-tion to offer the appointee. (3) An appointee covered by this paragraph is entitled to be placed in a vacant SES position over an appointee who is still serving a probationary pe-riod.

(1) If there is no vacant SES position within the agency for which an appointee covered by §359.602(b) is qualified, the agency head, or the acting agency head in the absence of the agency head, shall cer-tify to OPM in writing that no such po-sition is available. This certification may not be delegated below the Assist-ant Secretary level in a department, or an equivalent level above the director of personnel in other agencies. (2) The 45-day period during which OPM will attempt to place the ap-pointee begins on the day the certifi-cation is acknowledged by OPM. (3) It is the continuing responsibility of an agency that has a surplus career appointee to place the appointee in any vacant SES position in the agency for which the appointee is qualified, even after the appointee is certified to OPM. (4) An individual remains a career SES appointee in his or her agency during the OPM placement period. (b) OPM authority. As provided by §U.S.C. 3595(b)(3), OPM may require an agency to take any action that OPM considers necessary to carry out a placement. (c) OPM referrals. (1) OPM may for- mally refer a career appointee to an agency for a specific SES vacancy or general priority consideration. Such a referral may not become a part of the regular competitive staffing process. The appointee must be considered by the agency for a noncompetitive SES appointment. (2) Any objection by the agency to the qualifications of the appointee must be based on the professional/tech-nical qualifications in the standard for the position. An agency may not rely solely on lack of agency-specific expe-rience for an objection based on lack of professional/technical qualifications if the appointee is otherwise qualified. (d) Agency response. (1) In order to ex- pedite placement of surplus career ap-pointees, an agency shall respond to an OPM referral within the time period prescribed by OPM. (2) If an agency fails to place a re- ferred career appointee in an SES posi-tion because of objection to the ap-pointee’s qualifications or because of any other reason, the agency response must be in writing and must be signed by the agency head, or the acting agen-cy head in the absence of the agency VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00327 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR318 5 CFR Ch.

(3) If an agency cancels a position while a referral to the position is pend-ing, the appointee will be entitled to priority consideration for the position if it or a successor position is reestab-lished in the SES within 1 year of the cancellation date and the appointee has not been placed in another SES po-sition. (e) Corrective action. If an agency fails to provide bona fide priority consider-ation, OPM may order appropriate cor-rective action. (f) Declination by employee. If a career appointee declines a reasonable offer of placement, OPM’s placement efforts will cease. The appointee may be re-moved from the SES at the expiration of the agency notice period.

(4) If the employee is moving to a po- sition under a different covered pay system whose grade has a higher com-parison rate, the agency must apply the applicable pay administration rules to determine the employee’s payable rate of basic pay (e.g., part 531, subpart B, for GS positions and part 532 for Federal Wage System provisions). If the promotion action results in a ter-minating condition as described in §536.308 (e.g., the resulting rate is equal to or greater than the existing retained rate), pay retention ceases to apply. Otherwise, the employee’s existing re-tained rate continues. (5) In applying this section to a re- tained rate employee who receives a temporary promotion or temporary re-assignment, the temporary promotion or temporary reassignment is not a basis for permanently terminating an employee’s pay retention entitlement. When the temporary promotion or tem-porary reassignment ends, the employ-ee’s pay retention entitlement will be determined as if the employee had not received the temporary promotion or temporary reassignment. (6) Notwithstanding §536.308(a)(1), an agency must continue a retained rate entitlement for an employee serving under an interim appointment made under 5 CFR 772.102 if the employee’s pay was retained under this subpart under the appointment immediately preceding the interim appointment.

(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for an employee’s position of record is in-creased while the employee is receiving a retained rate, the employee is enti-tled to 50 percent of the amount of the increase in that maximum rate, subject to the maximum rate limitation in §536.306. This 50-percent adjustment rule applies only when the maximum rate increases are attributable to the adjustment of the employee’s existing pay schedule or the establishment of a new pay schedule that covers the em-ployee’s existing position of record. (2) As provided in 5 CFR 531.206, a re- tained rate adjustment under para-graph (a)(1) of this section is a general pay adjustment that must be applied before any geographic conversion under §536.303(b) or any other simultaneous pay action. The retained rate adjust-ment under paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion must be determined based on the employee’s position of record and offi-cial worksite as in effect immediately before the effective date of the adjust-ment. (3) Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5363(c), a change in the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range based on a change in the employee’s official worksite is not considered in applying paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The employee’s new retained rate must be determined under the geographic con-version rule in §536.303(b). (4) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to an increase in an em-ployee’s highest applicable rate range that results from a change in the em-ployee’s position of record. Such an in-crease is not attributable to an adjust-ment in the pay schedule applicable to the employee’s position and thus is not an increase as described in 5 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2)(B). (b) When a pay schedule adjustment causes an employee’s retained rate (after any adjustment under this sec-tion) to become equal to or lower than the maximum rate of the highest appli-cable rate range for the grade of the employee’s position, the employee is entitled to the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range, and pay retention ceases to apply. § 536.306 Limitation on retained rates. (a) A retained rate may not at any time exceed the rate payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule. (b) When an employee’s retained rate is limited under this section, an agency may not apply this subpart or the pro-visions of any other law or regulation to the rate of basic pay the employee would have received but for this limi-tation.

It demonstrates a nuanced understanding of labor policies that are critical for both HR specialists and federal employees. The question seeks to clarify complex rules around compensable time, which is a practical concern for accurately calculating work hours, overtime, and ensuring fair compensation.

The query is particularly useful because:
1. It addresses a specific technical aspect of work time calculation that is not always straightforward
2. It requires understanding of potential exceptions, showing depth of inquiry beyond basic policy
3. It has direct implications for payroll, time tracking, and employee compensation
4. It would be valuable for HR professionals, managers responsible for scheduling, and employees seeking to understand their rights

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that while important, it represents a somewhat specialized area of labor regulation that might not be universally applicable to all federal employees. However, for those in roles involving shift work, extended hours, or complex scheduling, this question would be extremely valuable in understanding precise compensation rules."

The question targets a specific and nuanced area of federal compensation policy that is crucial for both HR specialists and federal employees to understand. 

The query about locality rate entitlement is particularly important because:
1. It impacts employee compensation directly
2. Requires precise understanding of regulatory triggers for pay changes
3. Has practical implications for both employees and HR management
4. Addresses a complex area of federal pay administration that is not immediately intuitive

HR specialists would find this question extremely valuable for ensuring accurate pay processing and compliance. Managers would benefit from understanding how and when locality pay adjustments occur. Federal employees would gain critical insight into potential changes in their compensation structure.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the technical details surrounding federal pay regulations, showing a genuine need for detailed information about how locality rates are administered and terminated. It goes beyond surface-level inquiry and seeks to understand the specific circumstances that can affect an employee's compensation, making it a high-value question for anyone involved in or studying federal employment compensation systems."
" What happens to an employee's accumulated religious compensatory time off when they separate from federal service or transfer to another agency?
"," Upon separation or transfer, the following rules apply:
1. For a positive balance of religious compensatory time off, the losing agency must compensate the employee at the hourly basic pay rate in effect when the time was earned
2. For a negative balance, the agency may:
   - Reduce the employee's balance of annual leave, credit hours, compensatory time off, or time-off awards
   - Any remaining negative balance must be resolved by charging leave without pay, which becomes an indebtedness subject to the agency's internal debt collection procedures","['writing (including elec-tronic communications).

(b) An agency must approve an em- ployee’s request to use religious com-pensatory time off unless the agency determines that approving the request would interfere with the agency’s abil-ity to efficiently carry out its mission. If the employee’s request to use reli-gious compensatory time off is denied, the agency must provide a written ex-planation as to the reason the request has been denied, regardless of whether the employee’s request was written or oral. (c) The agency must provide the em- ployee with an opportunity to earn re-ligious compensatory time off before the deadline established in §550.1006(c), although the specific timing of when an employee will be allowed to earn re-ligious compensatory time off by per-forming overtime work is a matter of agency discretion based on the needs of the agency. § 550.1006 Scheduling time to earn and use religious compensatory time off. (a) The scheduling of time to earn and use religious compensatory time off by an employee is subject to the agency’s approval as provided in §550.1005. (b) For an employee who earns reli- gious compensatory time off prior to using it, religious compensatory time off may be earned up to 13 pay periods in advance of the pay period in which the targeted religious observance com-mences and must be linked to specific dates and times for future use, as com-patible with agency mission require-ments. (c)(1) An employee who uses religious compensatory time off prior to earning it must fulfill his or her obligation to perform overtime work in exchange for the advanced religious compensatory time off within 13 pay periods after the pay period in which he or she used reli-gious compensatory time off, or the agency must take action as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (2) The 13 pay periods described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are cal-culated beginning with the first pay pe- riod beginning after the date on which the religious compensatory time off was used. (3) If the employee fails to earn reli- gious compensatory time off within 13 pay periods after taking religious com-pensatory time off, the agency may take corrective action to eliminate or reduce the negative balance by making a corresponding reduction in the em-ployee’s balance of annual leave, credit hours, compensatory time off in lieu of regular overtime pay, compensatory time off for travel, or time-off awards. An agency may determine the order of precedence for applying the various types of paid time off to offset the neg-ative balance. Any negative balance of religious compensatory time off re-maining after any charging of these types of paid time off must be resolved by charging the employee leave with-out pay, which would result in an in-debtedness that is subject to the agen-cy’s internal debt collection proce-dures. § 550.1007 Accumulation and docu- mentation. (a) Agencies must keep records of the name and/or description of the reli-gious observance, and the dates, times, and amount of religious compensatory time off each employee earns and uses. An agency must credit religious com-pensatory time off for work performed on a time-for-time basis, under its time and attendance procedures. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an employee may accumulate only the amount of reli-gious compensatory time off needed to cover an approved absence for a reli-gious observance that has already oc-curred or to cover an approved absence for a future religious observance. An employee may only accumulate the amount of religious compensatory time off needed to cover the specific dates and times for which the employee has submitted a request for religious com-pensatory time off under §550.1004.

(d) Accumulated religious compen- satory time off that is not used as planned is not subject to time limits for usage. Unused religious compen-satory time off hours remain to the employee’s credit until used (subject to the agency’s approval under §550.1005), or the employee’s separation or trans-fer (subject to §550.1008), as applicable. § 550.1008 Employee separation or transfer. (a) Upon an employee’s separation from Federal service or transfer to an-other Federal agency, the losing agen-cy must compensate the employee for any positive balance of earned reli-gious compensatory time off to his or her credit. The agency must pay the employee for hours of earned religious compensatory time off at the hourly rate of basic pay in effect at the time religious compensatory time off was earned. (b) For an employee who has a nega- tive balance of religious compensatory time off upon an employee’s separation from Federal service or transfer to an-other Federal agency, the losing agen-cy may take corrective action to elimi-nate or reduce the negative balance by making a corresponding reduction in the employee’s balance of annual leave, earned credit hours, compensatory time off in lieu of regular overtime pay, compensatory time off for travel, or time-off awards. An agency may de-termine the order of precedence for ap-plying the various types of paid time off to offset the negative balance. Any negative balance of religious compen-satory time off remaining after any charging of these types of paid time off must be resolved by charging the em-ployee leave without pay, which would result in an indebtedness that is sub-ject to the agency’s internal debt col-lection procedures. (c) For purposes of', 'the time of appointment to the SES held a career or career-conditional appoint-ment (or an appointment of equivalent tenure, as defined in §359.701(a)), is en-titled to be placed in a position of ten-ure equivalent to that of the appoint-ment held at the time of appointment to the SES. This tenure requirement does not apply— (1) If the agency taking the removal action does not have a position of equivalent tenure for which the ap-pointee meets the qualifications re-quirements; or (2) If the appointee is willing to ac- cept a position having a different ten-ure. § 359.703 Responsibility for placement.

(b)(1) The rate of basic pay under paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section includes any applicable locality pay-ment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate supplement under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or similar payment under other legal au-thority. (2) When an employee is entitled to a payable rate of basic pay under para-graph (a)(2) or (3) of this section which exceeds the maximum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of the employee’s position after placement, the resulting saved rate is subject to the adjustment and termination rules in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. (c)(1) For an employee placed in a General Schedule position, a saved rate established under this section may not be supplemented by a locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, a special rate sup-plement under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or a simi-lar payment under other legal author-ity. (2) A saved rate established under this section is subject to the limitation on Senior Executive Service pay in 5 U.S.C. 5382 of the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule. (3) A saved rate established under this section is considered an employ-ee’s rate of basic pay for the same pur-poses as a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536, as described in 5 CFR 536.307. (d) A saved rate established under this section must be adjusted in con-nection with a pay schedule adjust-ment according to the following rules: (1) When the maximum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of an employee’s position is increased while the employee is receiving a saved rate, the employee is entitled to a pay ad-justment equal to 50 percent of the amount of the increase in that max-imum payable rate, except as otherwise provided in this section. (2) If an employee’s official worksite is changed while the employee is re-ceiving a saved rate, a change in the applicable range maximum because of a change in an employee’s official worksite is not considered in applying paragraph (d)(1) of this section. In-stead, any adjustment of the employ-ee’s saved rate in conjunction with a change in official worksite must be de-termined under paragraph (e) of this section. If an employee’s range max-imum is increased because of a pay schedule adjustment on the same effec-tive date as a change in the employee’s official worksite, the saved rate must be adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section before applying paragraph (e) of this section. (3) A change in an employee’s rate range maximum resulting from a change in the employee’s position (e.g., change in occupational series) that causes the employee to be covered by a different pay schedule does not result in application of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (4) When an employee’s saved rate be- comes equal to or lower than the max-imum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of the employee’s posi-tion, the employee is entitled to the maximum payable rate, and saved pay under this section ceases to apply. (e) When an employee receiving a saved rate established under this sec-tion is covered by a pay system that provides different basic pay schedules based on geographic location (such as the General Schedule pay system), the saved rate must be adjusted in conjunc-tion with a change in the employee’s official worksite consistent with the geographic conversion rule for retained rates under 5 CFR 536.303(b). (f) A saved rate established under this section must be terminated if— (1) The employee has a break in serv- ice of 1 workday or more; (2) The employee is demoted based on unacceptable performance or conduct or at the employee’s request; or (3) The employee becomes entitled to a rate of basic pay that is equal to or higher than the saved rate.

(a) The requirement in §550.151 that a position be one in which the hours of duty cannot be controlled administra-tively is inherent in the nature of such VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00620 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR611 Office of Personnel Management § 550.154 a position. A typical example of a posi- tion which meets this requirement is that of an investigator of criminal ac-tivities whose hours of duty are gov-erned by what criminals do and when they do it. He is often required to per-form such duties as shadowing sus-pects, working incognito among those under suspicion, searching for evi-dence, meeting informers, making ar-rests, and interviewing persons having knowledge of criminal or alleged crimi-nal activities. His hours on duty and place of work depend on the behavior of the criminals or suspected criminals and cannot be controlled administra-tively. In such a situation, the hours of duty cannot be controlled by such ad-ministrative devices as hiring addi-tional personnel; rescheduling the hours of duty (which can be done when, for example, a type of work occurs pri-marily at certain times of the day); or granting compensatory time off duty to offset overtime hours required. (b) In order to satisfactorily dis- charge the duties of a position referred to in §550.151, an employee is required to perform substantial amounts of ir-regular or occasional overtime work. In regard to this requirement: (1) A substantial amount of irregular or occasional overtime work means an average of at least 3 hours a week of that overtime work. (2) The irregular or occasional over- time work is a continual requirement, generally averaging more than once a week. (3) There must be a definite basis for anticipating that the irregular or occa-sional overtime work will continue over an appropriate period with a dura-tion and frequency sufficient to meet the minimum requirements under para-graphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. (c) The words in §550.151 that an em- ployee is generally ‘‘responsible for recognizing, without supervision, cir-cumstances which require him to re-main on duty’’ mean that: (1) The responsibility for an em- ployee remaining on duty when re-quired by circumstances must be a definite, official, and special require-ment of his position. (2) The employee must remain on duty not merely because it is desirable, but because of compelling reasons in-herently related to continuance of his duties, and of such a nature that fail-ure to carry on would constitute neg-ligence. (3) The requirement that the em- ployee is responsible for recognizing circumstances does not include such clear-cut instances as, for example, when an employee must continue working because a relief fails to report as scheduled. (d) The words ‘‘circumstances which require him to remain on duty’’ as used in §550.151 mean that: (1) The employee is required to con- tinue on duty in continuation of a full daily tour of duty or that after the end of his regular workday, the employee resumes duty in accordance with a pre-arranged plan or an awaited event. Per-formance of only call-back overtime work referred to in §550.112(h) does not meet this requirement. (2) The employee has no choice as to when or where he may perform the work when he remains on duty in con-tinuation of a full daily tour of duty. This differs from a situation in which an employee has the option of taking work home or doing it at the office; or doing it in continuation of his regular hours of duty or later in the evening. It also differs from a situation in which an employee has such latitude in his working hours, as when in a travel sta-tus, that he may decide to begin work later in the morning and continue working later at night to better accom-plish a given objective.

(b) If an agency proposes to pay an employee premium pay on an annual basis under §550.151 but unusual condi-tions seem to make the applicable rate in paragraph (a) of this section unsuit-able, the agency may propose a rate of premium pay on an annual basis for OPM approval. The proposal shall in-clude full information bearing on the frequency and duration of the irregular or occasional overtime work required; the nature of the work which prevents hours of duty from being controlled ad-ministratively; the necessity for the employee being generally responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require him to re-main on duty; and any other pertinent conditions. (c) The period of time during which an employee continues to receive pre-mium pay on an annual basis under §550.151 under the authority of para-graphs (c) or (g) of §550.162 is not con-sidered in computing the average hours of irregular and occasional overtime work under this section.

The question demonstrates a genuine information need that would be valuable for:

1. Federal employees planning to leave their current agency or federal service
2. HR specialists managing leave accounting and transfer processes
3. Managers responsible for tracking and administering employee leave

The question touches on an important procedural detail within Title 5 regulations regarding religious compensatory time, which is not always well-understood. It seeks clarity on the disposition of a specific type of leave during employment transitions, which has direct implications for both employees and administrative staff.

The practicality is high because it addresses a concrete scenario that many federal employees might encounter. Understanding what happens to accumulated religious compensatory time during separation or transfer is crucial for accurate leave management and employee planning.

While not a complex policy question, it represents a specific, actionable information need that can help prevent misunderstandings or potential loss of earned compensatory time. The technical nature of the question suggests it comes from someone with a serious, professional interest in federal employment regulations."
" Under what circumstances can a Presidential appointee be reinstated to a Senior Executive Service (SES) position after leaving their appointment?
"," According to the policy, a Presidential appointee can be reinstated to an SES position if they meet certain conditions. They must apply to OPM within 90 days of leaving the Presidential appointment, and the reinstatement can occur through two primary methods: (1) An OPM-directed reinstatement, where OPM orders an agency to reinstate the appointee to an appropriate position, or (2) Direct negotiations with an agency, where the agency voluntarily reinstates the appointee. Upon reinstatement, the individual becomes an SES career appointee and, if they were in an SES probationary period when initially appointed, must complete the remaining probationary period. The agency must comply with OPM's reinstatement order within 30 calendar days and notify OPM within 5 workdays of the reinstatement.","['consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. § 179.202 Scope.

(c) An employee who resides perma- nently, or temporarily for his or her own convenience at a remote duty post is not eligible for an authorized allow-ance rate during his or her period of residence. § 591.307 Payment of allowance rate. (a) An authorized allowance rate is earned on a daily basis; however, where appropriate for administrative conven-ience, the rate may be averaged taking into consideration the number of non-commuting days over a period of time, and paid for each workday, excluding days in a nonpay status and period of extended absence. (b) The transportation allowance is paid only when expense is incurred and at the lowest rate consistent with available transportation. (c) The inconvenience or hardship al- lowance is paid regardless of eligibility for the transportation expense part of the allowance rate when the employee is otherwise eligible. (d) Except as provided under §591.305(b)(4)(ii), when the necessity for remaining at the post of duty for the workweek is the basis for the allow-ance under §591.304(a)(2), the allowance rate is paid for each full day, or pro-rated for each part of a day, that the employee remains at the duty post.

(3) An employee who does not provide the required evidence or medical cer-tification within the specified time pe-riod is not entitled to use disabled vet-eran leave, and the agency may, as ap-propriate and consistent with applica-ble laws and regulations— (i) Charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL); or (ii) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off. § 630.1308 Disabled veteran leave for- feiture, transfer, reinstatement. (a) Disabled veteran leave not used during the 12-month eligibility period may not be carried over to subsequent years and must be forfeited. (b) If a change in the employee’s dis- ability rating during the 12-month eli-gibility period causes the employee to no longer have a qualifying service- connected disability (as described in §630.1304(d)), any unused disabled vet-eran leave to the employee’s credit as of the effective date of the rating change must be forfeited. (c) When an employee with a positive disabled veteran leave balance trans-fers between positions in different agencies, or transfers from the United States Postal Service or Postal Regu-latory Commission to a position in an-other agency, during the 12-month eli-gibility period, the agency from which the employee transfers must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours available for credit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the expiration date of the employee’s 12-month eligibility pe- riod to the gaining agency. Any unused disabled veteran leave will be forfeited at the end of that eligibility period. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ‘‘transfers’’ means movement from a position in one agency (or the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission) to a position in another agency without a break in employment of 1 workday or more in circumstances where service in both positions qualifies as employment under this subpart. (d)(1) An employee covered by this subpart, or an employee of the United States Postal Service or Postal Regu-latory Commission, with a balance of unused disabled veteran leave who has a break in employment of at least 1 workday during the employee’s 12- month eligibility period, and later re-commences employment covered by 5 U.S.C. 6329 within that same eligibility period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused balance. (2) When an employee has a break in employment as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the losing agency must certify the number of unused dis-abled veteran leave hours available for recredit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the ex-piration date of the employee’s 12- month eligibility period. Any unused disabled veteran leave must be for-feited at the end of that eligibility pe-riod. (3) In the absence of the certification described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the recredit of disabled vet-eran leave may also be supported by written documentation available to the employing agency in its official per-sonnel records concerning the em-ployee, the official records of the em-ployee’s former employing agency, cop-ies of contemporaneous earnings and leave statement(s) provided by the em-ployee, or copies of other contempora-neous written documentation accept-able to the agency.

(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329a, which allows an agency to pro-vide a separate type of paid leave, on a limited basis, for general purposes not covered by other types of leave author-ized by other provisions of law. Section 6329a(c) authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations to carry out the statutory provisions on administrative leave, in-cluding regulations on the appropriate uses and the proper recording of this leave. (b) This subpart applies to an em- ployee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is employed in an agency, but does not apply to an intermittent employee who, by definition, does not have an es-tablished regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek. (c) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 6329a(d), this subpart applies to employees de-scribed in subsection (b) of 38 U.S.C. 7421, notwithstanding subsection (a) of that section. § 630.1402 Definitions. In this subpart: Administrative leave means paid leave authorized at the discretion of an agen-cy under 5 U.S.C. 6329a (and not author-ized under any other provision of stat-ute or Presidential directive) to cover periods within an employee’s tour of duty established for leave purposes when the employee is not engaged in activities that qualify as official hours of work, which is provided without loss of or reduction in— (1)']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the reinstatement of Presidential appointees to SES positions, including specific conditions such as time limits for making an application, direct negotiation options, tenure upon reinstatement, and agency compliance requirements, with only minor details potentially missing from a comprehensive answer.",4,"This question is highly relevant and practical for several key stakeholders in federal employment. For HR specialists and managers involved in executive-level appointments, understanding the reinstatement rules for Presidential appointees in the Senior Executive Service is crucial. The question addresses a specific and nuanced aspect of federal employment regulations that has direct implications for career mobility, succession planning, and executive-level transitions.

The question is particularly useful because:
1. It focuses on a high-level federal employment context (SES positions)
2. Explores the complex rules surrounding executive appointments and potential returns to service
3. Provides critical information for both current and potential SES-level employees
4. Helps HR professionals understand the legal and procedural frameworks for executive reinstatements

While not applicable to all federal employees, this question is extremely valuable for those in senior leadership roles, those managing executive transitions, and individuals navigating high-level federal career paths. The specificity of the question suggests a genuine need for detailed understanding of Title 5 regulations pertaining to Presidential appointments and SES positions."

(3) Review. The paying agency is not required or authorized to review the merits of the determination with re-spect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency. (c) Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another. (1) If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the employee’s paying agency, the employee transfers to a po-sition served by a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the paying agency from which the employee separates must certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee, an-other to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee’s transfer. How-ever, the creditor agency must submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency before collection can be resumed. (2) When an employee transfers to an- other paying agency, the creditor agen-cy need not repeat the due process pro-cedures described by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. However, the creditor agency is respon-sible for reviewing the debt upon re-ceiving the former paying agency’s no-tice of the employee’s transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.

This subpart provides regulations to implement sections 5551, 5552, and 6306 of title 5, United States Code, and must be read together with those sections. Sections 5551 and 5552 provide for the payment of a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave when an employee: (1) Separates from Federal service; or (2) Enters on active duty in the armed forces and elects to receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave. Section 6306 requires that when an employee is re- employed in the Federal service prior to the expiration of the lump-sum pe-riod, he or she must refund an amount equal to the pay covering the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the period of annual leave ( i.e., the lump-sum leave period). (b) Applicability. This subpart applies to— (1) Any employee who separates, dies, or transfers under the conditions pre-scribed in §550.1203; and (2) Any employee or individual em- ployed by a territory or possession of the United States who enters on active duty in the armed forces and who elects to receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave. (c) Administration. The head of an agency having employees subject to this subpart is responsible for the prop-er administration of this subpart. § 550.1202 Definitions.

Accumulated and ac-crued annual leave does not include an-nual leave received by a leave recipient under the voluntary leave transfer or leave bank programs established under subchapters III and IV of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, or annual leave advanced to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d). Administrative workweek has the meaning given that term in §610.102 of this chapter. Agency means—(1) An executive agen- cy and a military department as de-fined in sections 105 and 102 of title 5, United States Code, respectively; and (2) A legislative or judicial agency or a unit of the legislative or judicial branch of the Federal Government that has positions in the competitive serv-ice.

The Recent Graduates Program is a specific hiring pathway under the Federal Government's recruitment efforts, making it valuable for:

1. Recent college graduates seeking federal employment opportunities
2. HR specialists involved in recruitment and hiring
3. Managers looking to understand talent acquisition strategies
4. Career counselors and educational institutions advising students about federal job opportunities

The question seeks clear, actionable information about program eligibility requirements, which is crucial for understanding a specific federal employment pathway. It addresses a concrete information need related to Title 5 employment regulations, specifically focusing on a targeted hiring initiative.

The practicality is high because the Recent Graduates Program is an important entry point for young professionals into federal service. Understanding the key eligibility requirements helps potential applicants prepare and plan their career paths, while also assisting HR professionals in implementing the program effectively.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it's somewhat narrow in scope, focusing on a specific program rather than broader federal employment policies. However, for those directly interested in this hiring pathway, the question is extremely useful."

Agency means an agency with em- ployees covered by this subpart, as pro-vided in §531.402. Calendar week means a period of any seven consecutive calendar days. Critical element has the meaning given that term in §430.203 of this chapter.

The term also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. GM employee has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203. GS rate means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding additional pay of any kind such as lo-cality payments under subpart F of this part and special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455. A rate payable to a GM em-ployee is considered a GS rate. Law enforcement officer or LEO has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103. LEO special base rate means a special base rate established for GS law en-forcement officers at grades GS–3 through GS–10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub.

The question targets a nuanced regulatory provision that has significant practical implications for federal employees facing medical emergencies. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of Title 5 regulations and seeks to clarify the specific criteria used by leave bank boards when evaluating leave recipient eligibility.

The question is particularly valuable because:
1. It focuses on a specific regulatory section (§ 630.1007) related to employee leave benefits
2. It addresses a critical support mechanism for federal employees experiencing medical emergencies
3. It seeks to understand the decision-making process of leave bank boards
4. It would be highly relevant to HR specialists, managers, and employees who might need to navigate the shared leave program
5. The level of specificity suggests a genuine need for detailed policy understanding

HR professionals would find this question especially useful for understanding how to implement and interpret shared leave program policies. Employees facing medical challenges would benefit from knowing the precise criteria used to evaluate leave recipient status. The question demonstrates a sophisticated approach to understanding the nuanced application of federal employment regulations."
 What are the key requirements for an employee to earn compensatory time off instead of overtime pay?," According to §551.531, an employee can earn compensatory time off under two primary conditions:
1. For non-exempt employees, the agency head (or designee) may grant compensatory time off at the employee's request instead of overtime payment for irregular or occasional overtime work.
2. For employees under a flexible work schedule, compensatory time off can be granted instead of overtime payment for any overtime work, whether irregular or occasional.

However, the policy explicitly states that an agency cannot require an employee to take compensatory time off and employees cannot be intimidated or coerced into choosing compensatory time over overtime pay. Additionally, compensatory time must be used within 26 pay periods after earning, or it will be converted to monetary overtime pay.","['as constituting additional FLSA overtime pay. (This method does not apply to nondiscretionary bonuses established as a percentage of a seg-ment of pay, such as ratings-based cash awards under §451.104(g) of this chapter that are expressed as a percentage of basic pay, excluding locality adjust-ments. To meet overtime pay require-ments for these types of bonuses, use one of the methods described in para-graphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.) (c) Group-based bonus distribution methods. (1) For employees who have earned nondiscretionary group cash awards or bonuses, payment of a bonus under one of the methods of distribu-tion described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section is considered to be in full compliance with the overtime pay requirements of this subpart. These methods may not be used to cir-cumvent any bonus limitations that might otherwise apply. (2) Percentage method. (i) Identify the amount of the group bonus under the agency’s bonus plan and the period of time during which it was earned; (ii) Establish the group bonus as a percentage of the total pay ( i.e., total remuneration before considering the group bonus, including straight time pay for any overtime hours, plus any half-rate overtime pay under §551.512(a)(2)) earned by employees in the group during the bonus period; and (iii) Multiply the percentage in para-graph (c)(2)(ii) of this section times each individual employee’s total pay earned during the bonus period to de-termine each employee’s share of the group bonus. (3) Boosted hour method. (i) Identify the amount of the group bonus under the agency’s bonus plan and the period of time during which it was earned; (ii) Determine the total number of boosted hours for all employees under the group bonus plan by adding up the total number of hours of work by those employees (nonovertime and overtime hours) and increasing that sum by one- half of the total number of overtime hours; (iii) Divide the amount of the group bonus by the total number of boosted hours for all employees under the group bonus plan to determine the amount of the bonus allocable to each hour; and (iv) Multiply this hourly bonus amount by the number of boost-ed hours credited to each individual employee in the bonus period to deter-mine each employee’s share of the group bonus.

When taking a personnel action that results from a decision or order of OPM, the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board, Equal Employment Op-portunity Commission, or Federal Labor Relations Authority, as author-ized by the rules and regulations of those agencies, or as the result of a court order, a judicial or administra-tive settlement agreement, or an arbi-tral award under a negotiated agree-ment, the agency must follow the in-structions in the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions and comply with all other relevant substantive and docu-mentary requirements, including those applicable to retirement, life insur-ance, health benefits, and other bene-fits provided under this chapter. § 250.102 Delegated authorities. OPM may delegate its authority, in- cluding authority for competitive ex-aminations, to agencies, under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2), through a delegation agree-ment. The delegation agreement devel-oped with the agency must specify the conditions for applying the delegated authorities. The agreement must also set minimum standards of performance and describe the system of oversight by which the agency and OPM will mon-itor the use of each delegated author-ity. § 250.103 Consequences of improper agency actions. If OPM finds that an agency has taken an action contrary to a law, rule, regulation, or standard that OPM administers, OPM may require the agency to take corrective action.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1103(c), this sub- part defines a set of systems, including standards and metrics, for assessing the management of human capital by Federal agencies. These regulations apply to agencies covered by 31 U.S.C. 901(b) of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101–576), as well as 5 U.S.C. 1401 and support the performance planning and reporting that is required by sections 1115(a)(3) and (f) and 1116(d)(5) of title 31, United States Code. [83 FR 55931, Nov. 9, 2018] § 250.202 Definitions. Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) is the agency’s senior leader whose pri-mary duty is to: (1) Advise and assist the head of the agency and other agency officials in carrying out the agency’s responsibil-ities for selecting, developing, training, and managing a high-quality, produc- tive workforce in accordance with merit system principles; and (2) Implement the rules and regula- tions of the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the laws governing the civil service within the agency. CHCO agency is an Executive agency, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, which is re-quired by 5 U.S.C. 1401 and 31 U.S.C. 901(b)(1) to appoint a CHCO. Director of OPM is, among other things, the President’s advisor on ac-tions that may be taken to promote an efficient civil service and a systematic application of the merit system prin-ciples, including recommending poli-cies relating to the selection, pro-motion, transfer, performance, pay, conditions of service, tenure, and sepa-ration of employees. The Director of OPM provides governmentwide leader-ship and direction in the strategic management of the Federal workforce. Evaluation system is an agency’s over- arching system for evaluating the re-sults of all human capital planning and implementation of human capital strategies to inform the agency’s con-tinuous process improvement efforts. This system is also used for ensuring compliance with all applicable stat-utes, rules, regulations, and agency policies. Federal Workforce Priorities Report (FWPR) is a strategic human capital report, published by OPM by the first Monday in February of any year in which the term of the President com-mences. OPM may extend the date of publication if needed. The report com-municates key Governmentwide human capital priorities and suggested strate-gies. The report also informs agency strategic and human capital planning. Focus areas are areas that agencies and human capital practitioners must focus on to achieve a system’s stand-ard. HRStat is a strategic human capital performance evaluation process that identifies, measures, and analyzes human capital data to inform the im-pact of an agency’s human capital management on organizational results with the intent to improve human cap-ital outcomes. HRStat, which is a quarterly review process, is a compo-nent']",4,"The context provides detailed information about compensatory time off requirements, including that an employee can request compensatory time off instead of overtime pay, it must be at the agency head's discretion, cannot be forced by the agency, has a 26 pay period usage limit, and specifies conditions for payment if the time is not used, making it possible to comprehensively answer most aspects of the question.",5,"This is an excellent, highly practical question that directly addresses a critical compensation policy under Title 5. Compensatory time regulations are complex and frequently misunderstood by federal employees and managers alike. The question targets a specific area of federal employment compensation that has significant implications for workforce management, employee scheduling, and budget planning.

The usefulness of this question is high because:
1. Relevance: It precisely addresses compensation and leave policies covered under Title 5, specifically addressing alternative compensation mechanisms.
2. Practicality: Many federal employees, especially those in non-exempt positions, frequently encounter situations where understanding compensatory time rules is crucial.
3. Applicability: The answer would help:
- Employees understand their compensation options
- Managers properly manage overtime and compensatory time allocations
- HR specialists ensure compliance with federal labor regulations
- Budget planners understand workforce compensation strategies

The question is technically focused but clear, demonstrating a genuine need to understand the specific requirements for earning compensatory time. It requires a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations that goes beyond simple overtime pay calculations, making it valuable for multiple stakeholders in the federal employment ecosystem."

(c) Each agency having a tentatively approved project plan shall: (1) Notify and make available copies of the project plan to: (i) All employees who may be inter- ested in or affected by the activities of the demonstration project; and (ii) All labor organizations accorded exclusive recognition for bargaining units which include employees in or af-fected by the project plan. (2) Certify to OPM in writing when and how the requirements of §470.307(c)(1) were carried out and docu-ment the manner in which it insured that all affected employees were noti-fied. (3) Observe the consultation and ne- gotiation requirements of 5 U.S.C. 4703 (f) and (g). § 470.309 Public hearing. (a) Notice of public hearing. OPM shall hold a public hearing no less than 30 days after the date of its notice in the F EDERAL REGISTER during which inter- ested persons or organizations may present their written or oral views con-cerning the proposed demonstration project. The notice of public hearing shall be published in the F EDERAL REG- ISTER and shall: (1) State the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing; (2) Describe briefly the project; (3) Indicate where more information and a copy of the project plan may be obtained; (4) State the name and address of the person who will receive written com-ments from those unable to attend the hearing; and (5) Indicate the date by which writ- ten comments must be received to be considered. (b) Nature of public hearing. The hear- ing will be informal to encourage effec-tive oral presentations by interested individuals and organizations. The pre-siding officer, designated by the Direc-tor, OPM, shall in his or her reasonable discretion regulate the course of the proceedings and the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means. (c) A written summary shall be made of the oral evidence. (d) The record shall be left open for 2 weeks after the conclusion of the hear-ing to receive additional written data, views, and arguments from the parties participating in the hearing. § 470.311 Final project approval. (a) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment will consider all timely relevant oral and written views, arguments, and data before final approval or dis-approval of a project plan. OPM may request that the agency modify the tentatively approved project plan be-fore final approval because of com-ments and data received from the Con-gress, the public, labor organizations, and affected employees. OPM will not permit the agency to implement the project until all required consultation or negotiation has been completed, in-cluding the conclusion of impasse reso-lution and negotiability disputes. (b) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall provide a copy of the final version of the project plan to each House of the Congress at least 90 days in advance of the date the project is to take effect. (c) Agencies involved in the project shall communicate the content of the final project plan to: (1) Labor organizations and affected employees; and (2) Individuals and groups known to be interested in the project’s activities. § 470.313 Project implementation regu- lations. Agencies will prepare demonstration project implementing regulations, as appropriate, to replace Government- wide statutes and regulations waived for the project. Demonstration project implementing regulations issued pur-suant to an OPM-approved demonstra-tion project must be approved by OPM and shall have full force and authority VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00397 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR388 5 CFR Ch.

OPM-approved projects permit the testing of alternative personnel sys-tems and procedures in accordance with the provisions of the project plan. The provisions of approved project plans will not be modified, duplicated in organizations not listed in the project plan, or extended by agencies to individuals or groups of employees not included in the project plan with-out the approval of the Office of Per-sonnel Management. OPM will inform the agency of notification responsibil-ities under §470.307. The extent of noti-fication requirements will depend on the nature and extent of the requested project modification. § 470.317 Project evaluation. (a) Compliance evaluation. OPM will review the operation of the project pe-riodically to determine its compliance with the requirements of this part and the approved project plan. If OPM de-termines that an agency is not meeting legal, regulatory, or project plan re-quirements, it may, as appropriate, di-rect the agency to take corrective ac-tion or terminate the project. (b) Results evaluation. All approved project plans will contain an evalua-tion section to measure the impact of the project results in relation to its ob-jectives and to determine whether or not permanent changes in law and/or regulation should be considered or pro-posed. Where the project plan provides for agency evaluation of project re-sults, OPM will review those project evaluation efforts, may conduct eval-uations of its own, on a sample basis, to verify results, and may report its own conclusions. If OPM or the agency determines that an experiment is cre-ating a substantial hardship on, or is not in the best interest of, the public, the Federal Government, employees, or eligibles, even though the experiment is being conducted properly, OPM or the agency may jointly or unilaterally terminate the project.

(a) Establishment —(1) Agency’s obliga- tion. An agency must establish a pri- ority reemployment list whenever any applicants rated eligible under §302.302 meet the conditions set out in para-graphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this sec-tion and must consider candidates from that list in accordance with §302.304(a). All applicants not included on the pri-ority reemployment list will be listed on the regular employment list unless the agency elects to establish a reem-ployment list as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Agency discretion. In establishing its lists, an agency may, but is not re-quired to: Afford priority consideration to non-preference eligibles who meet the conditions set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; afford priority consideration under paragraph (b) of this section for a longer time and/or in a broader geographic area than the minimum requirement; and/or provide reemployment consideration after the priority list is exhausted to additional current and former employees in ac-cordance with paragraph (c) of this sec-tion. An agency may limit consider-ation granted at its discretion to appli-cants for specific positions or appli-cants who meet specific conditions, but must make those conditions a matter of record and must apply its policy uni-formly to all eligible employees. Gen-erally, full-time employees may be considered only for full-time positions and other-than-full-time employees only for other-than-full-time positions. However, full-time employees may be considered for other-than-full-time po-sitions if there are no other-than-full- time employees on the appropriate pri-ority or reemployment list; and other- than-full time employees may be con-sidered for full-time positions if there are no full-time employees on the ap-propriate list. (b) Priority reemployment list. Can- didates are entered on the priority re-employment list in the geographic areas specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and remain on the list for 2 years unless the agency elects to pro-vide a longer period of eligibility. The priority reemployment list includes: (1) The name of each former em- ployee of the agency who is a pref-erence eligible, has been furloughed or separated from a continuing appoint-ment without delinquency or mis-conduct, and applies for reemployment. Candidates in this category are consid-ered for positions in the commuting area where they were separated unless the agency elects to provide broader consideration. (2) The name of each former em- ployee of the agency who is a pref-erence eligible and who, as the result of an appeal under part 752 of this chap-ter, is found by the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board to have been unjustifiably dismissed from the agen-cy, but who is not entitled to imme-diate restoration under the Board’s de-cision. Candidates in this category are considered in the commuting area from which separated unless the Board’s de-cision specifies a broader or different area or the agency elects to afford broader geographic consideration. (3) The name of each former em- ployee of the agency who has been fur-loughed or separated due to compen-sable injury sustained under the provi-sions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter I, who is not entitled to immediate res-toration, and who is eligible for pri-ority consideration under this part. Candidates in this category are consid-ered in the commuting area where they last served and, if the agency deter-mines that an appropriate vacancy is unlikely to occur in that area during the candidates’ period of reemploy- ment priority, in other locations for which they are available. (4) At the agency’s discretion, the name of each former employee of the agency who is not a preference eligible, has been furloughed or involuntarily separated from a continuing appoint-ment without delinquency or mis-conduct, and applies for reemployment.

Employees may be entered on the reemployment list only for positions in which tenure and/or work schedule is no greater than that of the position previously held. (d) Order of entry. An agency shall enter the names of all applicants rated eligible under §302.302 on the appro-priate list (priority reemployment, re-employment, or regular employment) in the following order: (1) When candidates have been rated only for basic eligibility under §302.302(a). (i) Preference eligibles having a com-pensable, service-connected disability of 10 percent or more (designated as ‘‘CP’’) unless the list will be used to fill professional positions at the GS–9 level or above, or equivalent; (ii) All other candidates eligible for 10-point veteran preference; (iii) All candidates eligible for 5- point veteran preference; (iv) All candidates eligible for sole survivorship preference and (v) Qualified candidates not eligible for veteran preference. (2) When qualified candidates have been assigned numerical scores under §302.302(b). (i) Preference eligibles hav- ing a compensable, service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, in the order of their augmented ratings, un-less the list will be used to fill profes-sional positions at the GS–9 level or above, or equivalent; (ii) All other qualified candidates in the order of their augmented ratings. At each score, qualified candidates eli-gible for 10-point preference will be en-tered first, followed, second, by 5-point preference eligibles, third, by sole sur-vivorship preference eligibles, and last, by nonpreference eligibles.

(g) When a remote duty post is deter- mined by the Office of Personnel Man-agement under paragraph (a)(3) or (c) of §591.304 as being basically eligible for an allowance, the Office of Per-sonnel Management will determine the basis for payment of the allowance rate taking into consideration the facts and circumstances associated with com-muting to the remote duty post. § 591.308 Relationship to additional pay payable under other statutes. An allowance authorized under this subpart is in addition to any additional pay or allowances payable under other statutes. It shall not be considered part of the employee’s rate of basic pay in computing additional pay or allow-ances payable under other statutes. § 591.309 Effective date for payment of allowances. When an allowance is authorized for a remote duty post, the authorization shall specify the effective date that an agency shall begin paying the allow-ance to its employees, except that a date earlier than January 8, 1971, may not be specified. § 591.310 Effect of regulations in this subpart on allowances established under previous statutes.

App 6(d)). Annual summary rating means the overall rating level that an appointing authority assigns at the end of the ap-praisal period after considering (1) the initial summary rating, (2) any input from the executive or a higher level re-view, and (3) the applicable Perform-ance Review Board’s recommendations. This is the official final rating for the appraisal period. Appointing authority means the de- partment or agency head, or other offi-cial with authority to make appoint-ments in the Senior Executive Service (SES). Appraisal period means the estab- lished period of time for which a senior executive’s performance will be ap-praised and rated. Critical element means a key compo- nent of an executive’s work that con-tributes to organizational goals and re-sults and is so important that unsatis-factory performance of the element would make the executive’s overall job performance unsatisfactory. Initial summary rating means an over- all rating level the supervisor derives, from appraising the senior executive’s performance during the appraisal pe-riod in relation to the critical elements and performance standards and re-quirements, and forwards to the Per-formance Review Board. Oversight official means the agency head or the individual specifically des-ignated by the agency head who pro-vides oversight of the performance management system and issues per-formance appraisal guidelines. Performance means the accomplish- ment of the work described in the sen-ior executive’s performance plan. Performance appraisal means the re- view and evaluation of a senior execu-tive’s performance against critical ele-ments and performance standards and requirements. Performance management system means the framework of policies and practices that an agency establishes under sub-chapter II of chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, subpart A, and this subpart for planning, monitoring, de-veloping, evaluating, and rewarding both individual and organizational per-formance and for using resulting per-formance information in making per-sonnel decisions. Performance requirement means a de- scription of what a senior executive must accomplish, or the competencies demonstrated, for a critical element. A performance requirement establishes the criteria to be met to be rated at a specific level of performance and gen-erally includes quality, quantity, time-liness, cost savings, manner of per-formance, or other factors. Performance standard means a nor- mative description of a single level of performance within five such described levels of performance ranging from un-satisfactory performance to out-standing performance. Performance standards provide the benchmarks for developing performance requirements against which actual performance will be assessed. Progress review means a review of the senior executive’s progress in meeting the performance requirements. A progress review is not a performance rating. Senior executive performance plan means the written critical elements and performance requirements against which performance will be evaluated during the appraisal period by applying the established performance standards. The plan includes all critical elements, VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00373 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR364 5 CFR Ch.

Strategic planning initiatives means agency strategic plans as required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, annual performance plans, organiza-tional work plans, and other related initiatives. System standards means the OPM-es- tablished requirements for perform-ance management systems. § 430.304 SES performance manage- ment systems. (a) To encourage excellence in senior executive performance, each agency must develop and administer one or more performance management sys-tems for its senior executives in ac-cordance with the system standards es-tablished in §430.305. (b) Performance management sys- tems must provide for— (1) Identifying executives covered by the system; (2) Monitoring progress in accom- plishing critical elements and perform-ance requirements and conducting progress reviews at least once during the appraisal period, including inform-ing executives on how well they are performing; (3) Establishing an official perform- ance appraisal period for which an an-nual summary rating must be pre-pared; (4) Establishing a minimum appraisal period of at least 90 days; (5) Ending the appraisal period at any time after the minimum appraisal pe-riod is completed, but only if the agen-cy determines there is an adequate basis on which to appraise and rate the senior executive’s performance and the shortened appraisal period promotes ef-fectiveness; and (6) Establishing criteria and proce- dures to address performance of senior executives who are on detail, tempo-rarily reassigned, or transferred as de-scribed at §430.312(c)(1), and for other special circumstances established by the agency. § 430.305 System standards for SES performance management systems. (a) Each agency performance man- agement system must incorporate the following system standards: (1) Use critical elements based on OPM-validated executive competencies to evaluate executive leadership and results, including the quality of the ex-ecutive’s performance; (2) Align performance requirements with agency mission and strategic planning initiatives; (3) Define performance standards for each of the summary rating perform-ance levels, which also may be used for the individual elements or performance requirements being appraised; (4) Appraise each senior executive’s performance at least annually against performance requirements based on es-tablished performance standards and other measures; (5) Derive an annual summary rating through a mathematical method that ensures executives’ performance aligns with level descriptors contained in per-formance standards that clearly dif-ferentiate levels above fully successful, while prohibiting a forced distribution of rating levels for senior executives; (6) Establish five summary perform- ance levels as follows: (i) An outstanding level; (ii) An exceeds fully successful level; (iii) A fully successful level; (iv) A minimally satisfactory level; and (v) An unsatisfactory level; (7) Include equivalency statements in the system description for agency-spe-cific terms for the five summary per-formance levels aligning them with the five performance levels required in §430.305(a)(6); and (8) Use performance appraisals as a basis to adjust pay, reward, retain, and develop senior executives or make other personnel decisions, including re-movals as specified in §430.312.

For HR specialists and managers, understanding the SES performance management system's summary levels is crucial for accurate performance evaluations and career progression. For current and aspiring Senior Executive Service members, knowing these performance levels is essential for understanding how their performance is assessed and potentially impacts their career trajectory. The question directly addresses a specific, technical aspect of Title 5 regulations related to performance management in the federal government's senior leadership ranks. It demonstrates a precise information need that requires in-depth knowledge of SES performance evaluation frameworks, making it extremely valuable for those involved in or studying federal executive performance systems."

(a) In this section, reassignment means a permanent assignment to an-other SES position within the employ-ing executive agency or military de-partment. (See 5 U.S.C. 105 for a defini-tion of ‘‘executive agency’’ and 5 U.S.C. 102 for a definition of ‘‘military depart-ment.’’) (b) A career appointee may be reas- signed to any SES position for which qualified in accordance with the fol-lowing conditions: (1) Reassignment within a commuting area. For reassignment within a com- muting area, the appointee must re-ceive a written notice at least 15 days before the effective date of the reas-signment. This notice requirement may be waived only when the ap-pointee consents in writing. (2) Reassignment outside of a com- muting area. For reassignment outside of a commuting area, (i) the agency must consult with the appointee on the reasons for, and the appointee’s pref-erences with respect to, the proposed reassignment; and (ii) following such consultation, the agency must provide the appointee a written notice, includ-ing the reasons for the reassignment, at least 60 days before the effective date of the reassignment. This notice requirement may be waived only when the appointee consents in writing. (c) A career appointee may not be in- voluntarily reassigned within 120 days after the appointment of the head of an agency, or within 120 days after the ap-pointment of the career appointee’s most immediate supervisor who is a noncareer appointee and who has the authority to make an initial appraisal of the career appointee’s performance under subpart C of part 430 of this chapter. (1) In this paragraph— (i) Head of an agency means the head of an executive or military department or the head of an independent estab-lishment. (ii) Noncareer appointee includes an SES', 'Transportation expenses incurred in commuting to the remote post of duty as compared to transportation ex-penses (including cost of public trans- portation service) representative of those incurred in metropolitan areas within the United States or overseas as appropriate as periodically determined by the Office of Personnel Manage-ment. (2) Expenses incurred for lodging, meals, other services, and miscella-neous expenses when it is not feasible for an employee to commute daily as at duty posts determined under §591.304(a)(2). (3) Inconvenience or hardship associ- ated with commuting to the remote duty post taking into account such fac-tors as travel time, road conditions and terrain, type and quality of vehicle, and climate conditions, and conditions that exist at those duty posts deter-mined by the Office of Personnel Man-agement to meet the criteria in §591.304(a)(2). (4) Operational or workload demands, weather conditions, or other situations which require an employee to report to or remain at this post of duty substan-tially beyond his or her normal arrival or departure time with respect to those duty posts meeting the criteria in §591.304(a)(2). (b) Authorized allowance rates. Each authorized allowance rate for each duty post may consist of up to three parts, separately stated as appropriate, and the authorized allowance rate shall be paid as provided in §591.306, but no employee may be paid more than $10 a day. The parts which make up the au-thorized allowance rate are: (1) Transportation allowance —(i) Com- muting by private motor vehicle. A trans- portation allowance schedule showing the daily transportation expense rate to be paid under the distances and con-ditions described, when commuting by private motor vehicle is set out as ap-pendix A to this subpart and is incor-porated in and made part of this sec-tion. (ii) Travel by commercial or Govern- ment-provided transportation. The trans- portation allowance shall be limited to the cost of the service less normal cost for public transportation service in metropolitan areas. (2) Inconvenience or hardship allow- ance.

An allowance schedule covering land travel by motor vehicle, showing the daily rates to be paid under the time factors and condi-tions described, for inconvenience or hardship combined, is set out as appen-dix B to this subpart and is incor-porated in and made part of this sec-tion. (3) Other commuting situations. Not- withstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, when commuting is by boat, aircraft or an unusual con-veyance, or under extraordinary condi-tions by motor vehicle, or involving factors or conditions unique to the duty post, the Office of Personnel Man-agement shall establish the allowance based on the facts and circumstances of that individual remote duty post. (4) Miscellaneous. When daily com- muting is impractical as determined under §591.304(a)(2): (i) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may authorize a miscellaneous allowance, the amount to depend on such factors as miscellaneous expenses, living conditions that exist at the duty post, or inconvenience or hardship that may be associated with this type of employment environment. When em-ployees are required to pay a fee for lodging, meals, or other services at the remote duty post, the miscellaneous al-lowance shall at least equal the amount charged for the use of facilities and services. (ii) On those days when operational or workload demands, weather condi-tions, or other situations result in em-ployees reporting to or remaining at the remote duty post substantially be-yond normal arrival or departure time, the maximum daily allowance rate of $10 shall be paid. § 591.306 Employee eligibility for an al- lowance. (a) An authorized allowance rate shall be paid to each employee with a permanent duty station at or within a remote post of duty approved under §591.304, regardless of type of appoint-ment or work schedule, only (1) when the employee travels the prescribed minimum distance and time, or is sub- ject to prescribed minimum inconven-ience or hardship factors, while com-muting from the nearest established community or suitable place of resi-dence and the remote duty post, or (2) the employee remains at the worksite at the direction of management be-cause daily commuting is impractical. (b) An employee shall be paid an au- thorized allowance rate for those days on which he or she incurs unusual ex-pense in commuting to a remote post of duty or for those days on which he or she is subject to extraordinary in-convenience or hardship during the commuting. (c) An employee who resides perma- nently, or temporarily for his or her own convenience at a remote duty post is not eligible for an authorized allow-ance rate during his or her period of residence. § 591.307 Payment of allowance rate. (a) An authorized allowance rate is earned on a daily basis; however, where appropriate for administrative conven-ience, the rate may be averaged taking into consideration the number of non-commuting days over a period of time, and paid for each workday, excluding days in a nonpay status and period of extended absence. (b) The transportation allowance is paid only when expense is incurred and at the lowest rate consistent with available transportation. (c) The inconvenience or hardship al- lowance is paid regardless of eligibility for the transportation expense part of the allowance rate when the employee is otherwise eligible. (d) Except as provided under §591.305(b)(4)(ii), when the necessity for remaining at the post of duty for the workweek is the basis for the allow-ance under §591.304(a)(2), the allowance rate is paid for each full day, or pro-rated for each part of a day, that the employee remains at the duty post. (e) The transportation allowance pre- scribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of §591.305, or other allowance as may be prescribed for commuting by private motor vehicle, may not be paid unless the officially approved work schedule of the employee precludes use of the VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00837 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR828 5 CFR Ch.

(3) An employee who does not provide the required evidence or medical cer-tification within the specified time pe-riod is not entitled to use disabled vet-eran leave, and the agency may, as ap-propriate and consistent with applica-ble laws and regulations— (i) Charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL); or (ii) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off. § 630.1308 Disabled veteran leave for- feiture, transfer, reinstatement. (a) Disabled veteran leave not used during the 12-month eligibility period may not be carried over to subsequent years and must be forfeited. (b) If a change in the employee’s dis- ability rating during the 12-month eli-gibility period causes the employee to no longer have a qualifying service- connected disability (as described in §630.1304(d)), any unused disabled vet-eran leave to the employee’s credit as of the effective date of the rating change must be forfeited. (c) When an employee with a positive disabled veteran leave balance trans-fers between positions in different agencies, or transfers from the United States Postal Service or Postal Regu-latory Commission to a position in an-other agency, during the 12-month eli-gibility period, the agency from which the employee transfers must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours available for credit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the expiration date of the employee’s 12-month eligibility pe- riod to the gaining agency. Any unused disabled veteran leave will be forfeited at the end of that eligibility period. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ‘‘transfers’’ means movement from a position in one agency (or the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission) to a position in another agency without a break in employment of 1 workday or more in circumstances where service in both positions qualifies as employment under this subpart. (d)(1) An employee covered by this subpart, or an employee of the United States Postal Service or Postal Regu-latory Commission, with a balance of unused disabled veteran leave who has a break in employment of at least 1 workday during the employee’s 12- month eligibility period, and later re-commences employment covered by 5 U.S.C. 6329 within that same eligibility period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused balance. (2) When an employee has a break in employment as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the losing agency must certify the number of unused dis-abled veteran leave hours available for recredit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the ex-piration date of the employee’s 12- month eligibility period. Any unused disabled veteran leave must be for-feited at the end of that eligibility pe-riod. (3) In the absence of the certification described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the recredit of disabled vet-eran leave may also be supported by written documentation available to the employing agency in its official per-sonnel records concerning the em-ployee, the official records of the em-ployee’s former employing agency, cop-ies of contemporaneous earnings and leave statement(s) provided by the em-ployee, or copies of other contempora-neous written documentation accept-able to the agency.

(b) This subpart applies to an em- ployee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is employed in an agency, but does not apply to an intermittent employee who, by definition, does not have an es-tablished regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek. (c) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 6329a(d), this subpart applies to employees de-scribed in subsection (b) of 38 U.S.C. 7421, notwithstanding subsection (a) of that section. § 630.1402 Definitions. In this subpart: Administrative leave means paid leave authorized at the discretion of an agen-cy under 5 U.S.C. 6329a (and not author-ized under any other provision of stat-ute or Presidential directive) to cover periods within an employee’s tour of duty established for leave purposes when the employee is not engaged in activities that qualify as official hours of work, which is provided without loss of or reduction in— (1)']",4,"The context provides comprehensive details about the types of debts that can be collected through salary offset, including loans, fees, leases, rents, royalties, overpayments, penalties, damages, interests, and fines, while also clearly outlining specific exceptions such as debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code, Social Security Act, and tariff laws, making it possible to answer the question with substantial detail.",5,"This is an excellent question with high relevance and practical importance for federal employees, HR specialists, and payroll managers. The question directly addresses a critical aspect of Title 5 regulations concerning salary offset and debt collection, which impacts federal employees' financial rights and obligations. 

The query is particularly valuable because:
1. It seeks to clarify the specific types of debts that can be legally collected through salary offset
2. It explores potential exceptions, which is crucial for understanding employee protections
3. It addresses a real-world financial concern that affects many federal employees
4. The information is directly relevant to understanding wage garnishment rules in federal employment
5. It helps employees and HR professionals understand their rights and responsibilities regarding debt collection

This type of question would be particularly useful for:
- Federal employees concerned about potential wage garnishment
- HR specialists managing payroll and compliance
- Managers understanding employee financial protections
- Legal professionals interpreting federal employment regulations

The question demonstrates a substantive need for information about a complex but important aspect of federal employment financial regulations, making it highly valuable for multiple stakeholders."
" When can an agency pay a relocation incentive to an employee, and what key conditions must be met?
"," According to § 575.205, an agency can pay a relocation incentive when:
1. The employee relocates to a different geographic area (50+ miles or requiring a new residence) to accept a position
2. The employee is a current Federal Government employee
3. The employee's most recent performance rating is at least ""Fully Successful""
4. The new position is likely to be difficult to fill
5. The employee maintains residency in the new geographic area for the duration of a service agreement

Additionally, the agency cannot start a relocation incentive service agreement during an existing service agreement for a recruitment or previous relocation incentive.","['break in service of one day; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00173 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR164 5 CFR Ch.

(A) Full-time serv- ice, and part-time service on or after July 1, 1962, are counted as calendar time from the date of appointment to date of separation. (B) Intermittent service on or after July 1, 1962, is counted as 1 day for each day an employee is in pay status, regardless of the number of hours for which the employee is actually paid on a given day. Agencies should consult the ‘‘260-Day Work Year Chart’’ in OPM’s Guide to Processing Personnel Ac- tions to convert intermittent days worked to calendar time. The service requirement may not be satisfied in less than 3 years of calendar time. (ii) Nonpay status on the rolls and time off the rolls. An agency may not credit periods of nonpay status and time off the rolls except as follows: (A) Credit the first 30 calendar days of each period of nonpay status on the rolls during full-time employment, or during part-time employment on or after July 1, 1962. On this same basis, a seasonal employee receives credit for the first 30 calendar days of each period of nonduty/nonpay status. Nonpay sta-tus in excess of 30 days is not cred-itable.

(iii) Restoration based on unwarranted or improper actions. Based on a finding made on or after March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation for which he or she is eligible to receive back pay. If the employee is restored to duty at a date later than the original adverse ac-tion, credit for intervening periods of nonpay status is given in accordance with other provisions of this sub- section. If the employee had been prop-erly separated from the rolls of the agency before a finding was made that the adverse action was unwarranted or improper, the correction and additional service credit given the employee may not extend beyond the date of the prop-er separation. (iv) Intervening service. Certain types of service that ordinarily are not cred-itable are counted when they intervene between two periods of creditable serv-ice. Under these conditions, credit each period of service: (A) In the excepted service of the Federal executive branch, including employment in nonappropriated fund positions in or under any Federal agen-cy; (B) Under temporary, term, or other nonpermanent employment in the Fed-eral competitive service; (C) In the Senior Executive Service; (D) In the Federal legislative branch; (E) In the Federal judicial branch; (F) In the armed forces; (G) In the District of Columbia Gov- ernment through December 31, 1979. For an employee on the District rolls on December 31, 1979, who converted on January 1, 1980, to the District inde-pendent personnel system, credit is also given for service between January 1, 1980, and September 25, 1980. Other-wise, service in the District of Colum-bia Government on or after January 1, 1980, is not creditable as intervening service; and (H) Performed overseas by family members, as defined by §315.608 of this chapter.

(b) An agency may pay a relocation incentive under paragraph (a) of this section when an employee must relo-cate to accept a position or assignment in a different geographic area. A posi-tion is considered to be in a different geographic area if the worksite of the new position is 50 or more miles from the worksite of the position held im-mediately before the move. If the worksite of the new position is less than 50 miles from the worksite of the position held immediately before the move, but the employee must relocate (i.e., establish a new residence) to ac- cept the position, an authorized agency official may waive the 50-mile require-ment and pay the employee a reloca-tion incentive subject to the require-ments of this subpart. In all cases, the employee must establish a residence in the new geographic area before the agency may pay a relocation incentive to the employee. A relocation incen-tive may be paid only if the employee maintains residency in the new geo-graphic area for the duration of the service agreement. (c) A relocation incentive may be paid only when the employee’s rating of record (or an official performance appraisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 CFR part 430) for the position held im-mediately before the move is at least ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equivalent.

SOURCE : 73 FR 58020, Oct. 6, 2008, unless otherwise noted. Subpart A—General Provisions § 295.101 Scope and purpose. (a) This part sets forth policies and procedures you must follow when you submit a demand or request to an em-ployee of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to produce official records and information, or provide testimony relating to official informa-tion, in connection with a legal pro-ceeding. You must comply with these requirements when you request the re-lease or disclosure of official records and information. (b) OPM intends these provisions to: (1) Promote economy and efficiency in its programs and operations; (2) Minimize the possibility of involv- ing OPM in controversial issues not re-lated to our functions; (3) Prevent the misuse of OPM em- ployees as involuntary expert wit-nesses for private interests or as inap-propriate expert witnesses as to the state of the law; (4) Maintain OPM’s impartiality among private litigants where neither OPM nor any other Federal entity is a named party; and (5) Protect sensitive, confidential in- formation and the deliberative proc-esses of OPM. (c) In providing for these require- ments, OPM does not waive the sov-ereign immunity of the United States. (d) This part provides guidance for the internal operations of OPM. It does not create any right or benefits, sub-stantive or procedural, that a party may rely upon in any legal proceeding against the United States. § 295.102 Applicability. This part applies to demands and re- quests to employees of OPM in legal proceedings in which OPM is not a named party, for factual or expert tes-timony relating to official information or for production of official records or information. However, it does not apply to: (a) Demands upon or requests for a current OPM employee to testify as to facts or events that are unrelated to his or her official duties or that are un-related to the functions of OPM; (b) Demands upon or requests for a former OPM employee to testify as to matters in which the former employee was not directly or materially involved while at OPM; (c) Requests for the release of records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a); and (d)']",4,"The context provides extensive details about relocation incentives, including specific conditions such as the employee must relocate to a different geographic area (50+ miles), maintain a performance rating of at least ""Fully Successful"", be a current federal employee, and the position must be likely difficult to fill, which allows for a comprehensive answer to the question with only minor details potentially missing.",5,"This is an excellent, highly practical question that directly addresses a specific aspect of federal employment policy under Title 5. Relocation incentives are an important tool for agencies to recruit and retain talent, and the question seeks to understand the precise conditions and circumstances under which such incentives can be authorized. 

The question is particularly useful for:
- HR specialists involved in workforce planning and employee recruitment
- Managers considering strategic talent acquisition and retention strategies
- Employees contemplating potential job transfers or promotions within the federal government
- Agency leadership looking to understand the regulatory framework for workforce mobility incentives

The query demonstrates a clear information need about the specific conditions and legal parameters surrounding relocation incentives, which are governed by specific provisions in Title 5. It requires a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations, making it a valuable question for anyone seeking to navigate the complexities of federal employment policies related to compensation and workforce management.

The practical nature of the question, its direct relevance to Title 5 regulations, and its potential broad applicability across federal agencies make it a top-tier inquiry that would provide actionable and important information for multiple stakeholders in the federal employment ecosystem."
 What types of payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs are not subject to garnishment?," According to §581.104, payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs that are not subject to garnishment include those based on non-service-connected disability or death, age, and need (as outlined in sections 501-562 of title 38 of the United States Code).","['benefits; (7) Any payment by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as compensation for a service-connected disability paid by the Secretary to a former member of the Armed Forces who is in receipt of retired or retainer pay if the former member has waived either the entire amount or a portion of the retired or retainer pay in order to receive such compensation.

In determining the amount of any ‘‘moneys due from, or payable by, the United States’’ to any individual, there shall be excluded amounts which: (a) Are owed by the individual to the United States, except that an indebted-ness based on a levy for income tax under section 6331 of title 26 of the United States Code, shall not be ex-cluded in complying with legal process for the support of minor children if the legal process was entered prior to the date of the levy; (b) Are required by law to be de- ducted from the remuneration or other payment involved, including, but not limited to: (1) Amounts withheld from benefits payable under title II of the Social Se-curity Act where the withholding is re-quired by law; (2) Federal employment taxes; (3) Amounts mandatorily withheld for the United States Soldiers’ and Air-men’s Home; (4) Fines and forfeitures ordered by a court-martial or by a commanding offi-cer; and (5) Amounts deducted for Medicare; (c) Are properly withheld for Federal, State, or local income tax purposes, if the withholding of the amounts is au-thorized or required by law and if amounts withheld are not greater than would be the case if the individual claimed all dependents to which he/she were entitled. The withholding of addi-tional amounts pursuant to section 3402(i) of title 26 of the United States Code may be permitted only when the individual presents evidence of a tax obligation which supports the addi-tional withholding; (d) Are deducted as health insurance premiums, including, but not limited to, amounts deducted from civil service annuities for Medicare where such de-ductions are requested by the Health Care Financing Administration; (e) Are deducted as normal retire- ment contributions, not including amounts deducted for supplementary coverage.

Amounts', 'is between GS step rates, apply the fol-lowing method: Step A Using the rates and ranges in effect immediately before the annual pay adjustment, find the dif- ference between the GM employee’s GS rate and the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee’s grade. Step B Find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the GS rate range in effect im-mediately before the annual pay adjustment. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation in 5 U.S.C. 5303(f), use the uncapped maximum rate.) Step C Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the employee’s relative position in the rate range. Step D Using rates and ranges in effect after the annual pay adjustment, find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the new GS rate range for the employee’s grade. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped max-imum rate.) Step E Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived from step C. Step F Add the result from step E to the minimum rate of the employee’s current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. The resulting rate is the GM employee’s new GS rate (subject to the EX level V pay limitation).

Locality rates and special rates are computed for GM employees in the same manner as locality rates and spe-cial rates for other GS employees. The applicable locality payment or special rate supplement is added on top of the GM employee’s GS rate. § 531.246 Within-grade increases for GM employees. GM employees are entitled to within- grade increases as provided under sub-part D of this part. A within-grade in-crease may not cause a GM employee’s GS rate to exceed the maximum GS rate of his or her grade. GM employees may receive quality step increases as provided in subpart E of this part. [73 FR 66153, Nov. 7, 2008] § 531.247 Maximum payable rate rule for GM employees. (a) A rate received by a GM employee may qualify as a highest previous rate under §531.222. (b) As provided in §§531.221(a) and 531.241(b), if an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a trans-fer, promotion, demotion, or reassign-ment to a position in which the em-ployee will no longer be a supervisor or management official, and if the em-ploying agency after the action chooses to apply the maximum payable rate rule, the agency must follow the rules in §531.221. (c) If an employee retains GM status after an action that allows application of the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221 to set the employee’s pay, the rules in §531.221 must be applied in ac-cordance with the following special provisions: (1) In comparing the employee’s high- est previous rate to an applicable rate range for the grade in which pay is being set, do not identify the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate. Instead, identify the rate in the rate range that equals the highest previous rate unless that highest previous rate is below the range minimum or above the range maximum. If the highest previous rate is below the range minimum, identify the minimum rate (step 1) of the grade. If the highest previous rate is above the range maximum, identify the max-imum rate (step 10) of the grade. (2) In applying §531.221(b) for an em- ployee whose highest previous rate is a GS rate, the highest previous rate must be compared to the GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00433 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR424 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 531.401 being set, but which was in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. If the highest previous rate was earned while the current GS rate range was in effect, the rate identified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the maximum payable GS rate. Otherwise, based on the rate identified in para-graph (c)(1) of this section, the agency must determine the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently being set. That corresponding rate is the maximum payable GS rate. If the high-est previous rate was above the range minimum and below the range max-imum, the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range must be derived as follows: Step A ........... Find the difference between the employee’s highest previous rate and the minimum rate for the GS rate range (for the employ-ee’s current grade) in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. Step B ............ Find the difference between the maximum rate and the min- imum GS rate for the rate range identified in step A. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped maximum rate.) Step C ............ Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the em-ployee’s relative position in the rate range. Step D ........... Using the current GS rate range (for the employee’s current grade), find the difference between the maximum rate and the minimum rate. (If the maximum GS rate was not payable be-cause of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped max-imum GS rate.) Step E ............ Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived under step C. Step F ............ Add the result from step E to the minimum rate for the employ- ee’s current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate the agency may pay the employee (subject to the EX level V pay limita-tion). (3) In applying §531.221(c) for an em- ployee whose highest previous rate is a special rate, the highest previous rate (after any geographic conversion) must be compared directly to the current highest applicable rate range for the employee’s position of record and offi-cial worksite after reassignment.

Department of Veterans Affairs Garnishment orders for civilian employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs should be sent to: Defense', 'overtime, and child labor provi- sions of the Act do not apply to any employee who spends all hours of work in a given workweek in an exempt area. (a) Application. When the foreign ex- emption applies, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply to any employee who spends all hours of work in a given workweek in an exempt area. When an employee meets one of the two criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the for-eign exemption applies until the em-ployee spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area as defined in §551.104. (b) Foreign exemption applies. If an employee meets one of the two fol-lowing criteria, the employee is subject to the foreign exemption of the Act and the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply: (1) The employee is permanently sta- tioned in an exempt area and spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas; or (2) The employee is not permanently stationed in an exempt area, but spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas. (c) Foreign exemption does not apply. For any given workweek, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provi-sions of the Act apply to an employee permanently stationed in an exempt area who spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area. For that work-week, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption, and the agency must determine the exemption status of such an employee as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this sec-tion. The foreign exemption does not resume until the employee again meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. (1) Same duties. If the duties per- formed during that workweek are con-sistent with the primary duties of the employee’s official position, the agency must designate the employee the same FLSA exemption status as if the em-ployee were permanently stationed in any nonexempt area. (2) Different duties. If the duties per- formed during that workweek are not consistent with the primary duties of the employee’s official position: (i) The agency must first designate the employee the same FLSA exemp- tion status as the employee would have been designated based on the duties in-cluded in the employee’s official posi-tion if the employee was permanently stationed in any nonexempt area; and (ii) The agency must determine the employee’s exemption status for that workweek by applying §551.211. (d) Resumption of foreign exemption. When an employee returns to any ex-empt area from performing any hours of work in any nonexempt area, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption until the employee meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. § 551.213 Exemption of employees re- ceiving availability pay. The following employees are exempt from the hours of work and overtime pay provisions of the Act: (a) A criminal investigator receiving availability pay under §550.181(a) of this chapter, as provided in 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(16)); (b) A pilot employed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection or its successor who is a law enforcement officer as de-fined in section 5541(3) of title 5, United States Code, and who receives avail-ability pay under section 5545a(i) of title 5, United States Code. § 551.214 Statutory exclusion. A customs officer who receives over- time pay under subsection (a) or pre-mium pay under subsection (b) of 19 U.S.C. 267 and under 19 CFR 24.16 for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law. § 551.215 Fire protection activities and 7(k) coverage for FLSA pay and ex-emption determinations. (a) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may determine that the provi-sions of section 7(k) of the Act apply to certain categories of fire protection employees based on appropriate fac-tors, such as the type of premium pay-ments they receive (see §551.501(a)(1) and (5) and §551.541).

Fire pro- tection activities involve the perform-ance of functions directly concerned with the response to and the control and extinguishment of fires; or per-formance of inspection of facilities and equipment for the primary purpose of reducing or eliminating fire hazards by trained firefighters eligible for reas-signment to fire control and suppres-sion or prevention duties; or provision of the primary ( i.e., the first called) rescue and ambulance service in con-nection with fire protection functions. (c) Engaged in fire protection activities. (1) An employee (including a fire-fighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, rescue worker, ambulance personnel, or hazardous materials worker) is considered engaged in fire protection activities for the purpose of determining possible application of section 7(k) of the Act as provided for in §551.501(a)(1) and (5) and §551.541 if the employee: (i) Is trained in fire suppression, has authority and responsibility to engage in fire suppression, and is employed by an organization with fire suppression as a primary mission; and (ii) Is engaged in the prevention, con- trol, and extinguishment of fires or re-sponse to emergency situations where life, property, or the environment is at risk. (2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the fol-lowing types of employees are engaged in fire protection activities for the pur-pose of determining possible applica-tion of section 7(k) of the Act: (i) Employees in positions properly classified in the Fire Protection and Prevention series, including any quali-fied firefighter who is assigned to per-form support functions (e.g., commu-nications or dispatching functions, equipment maintenance or repair) or who is transferred to an administrative or supervisory position within the fire protection activity, except when such administrative or supervisory work ex-empts the employee under executive, administrative, and professional con-siderations; (ii) Employees in positions properly classified in other series, such as For-estry Technician, for whom fire protec-tion functions constitute substantially full-time assignments throughout the year, or for the duration of a specified fire season within the year; (iii) Temporary employees hired sole- ly to perform fire suppression work on an as-needed basis; (iv) Members of rescue and ambu- lance crews with fire suppression train-ing, authority, and responsibility, who are part of a fire suppression organiza-tion, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section; and (v) Any other employee in any work- week in which the employee performs fire control or suppression work for 80 percent or more of the total hours worked. (d) Not engaged in fire protection activi- ties. Examples of types of', 'adjusted by NAF instru-mentalities on an annual basis and at such additional times as new or revised minimum wage statutes require. The amount of any tip offset may vary within a single instrumentality based on location, type of service, or time of service. (d) If tipped employees are rep- resented by a labor organization hold-ing exclusive recognition, the employ-ing NAF instrumentality shall nego-tiate with such organization to arrive at a determination as to whether, when, and how much tip offset shall be applied. Changes in tip offset practices may be made more frequently than an-nually as a result of collective bar-gaining agreement. (e) Tip offset practices shall be gov- erned by the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, or the applicable statutes of the State, possession or territory where an employee works, whichever provides the greater benefit to the em-ployee. In locations where tip offset is prohibited by law, the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply. [55 FR 46146, Nov. 1, 1990] § 532.285 Special wage schedules for supervisors of negotiated rate Bu-reau of Reclamation employees. (a) The Department of the Interior shall establish and issue special wage schedules for wage supervisors of nego-tiated rate wage employees in the Bu-reau of Reclamation. These schedules shall be based on annual special wage surveys conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation in each special wage area. Survey jobs representing Bureau of Reclamation positions at up to four levels will be matched to private indus-try jobs in each special wage area. Spe-cial schedule rates for each position will be based on prevailing rates for that particular job in private industry. (b) Each supervisory job shall be de- scribed at one of four levels cor-responding to the four supervisory sit-uations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. They shall be titled in accordance with regular FWS practices, with the added designation of level I, II, III, or IV. The special survey and wage schedule for a given special wage area includes only those occupations and levels having employees in that area. For each posi-tion on the special schedule, there shall be three step rates. Step 2 is the prevailing rate as determined by the survey; step 1 is 96 percent of the pre-vailing rate; and step 3 is 104 percent of the prevailing rate. (c) For each special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation shall designate and appoint a special wage survey com-mittee, including a chairperson and two other members (at least one of whom shall be a supervisor paid from the special wage schedule), and one or more two-person data collection teams (each of which shall include at least one supervisor paid from the special wage schedule). The local wage survey committee shall determine the pre-vailing rate for each survey job as a weighted average. Survey specifica-tions are as follows for all surveys: (1) Based on Bureau of Reclamation activities and types of supervisory po-sitions in the special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation must survey private industry companies, with no VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00474 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR465 Office of Personnel Management § 532.285 minimum employment size require- ment for establishments, in the fol-lowing North American Industry Clas- sification System code subsectors: 2022 NAICS codes 2022 NAICS industry titles 211 ..................................

(2) Each local wage survey com- mittee shall compile lists of all compa-nies in the survey area known to have potential job matches. For the first survey, all companies on the list will be surveyed. Subsequently, companies shall be removed from the survey list if they prove not to have job matches, and new companies will be added if they are expected to have job matches. Survey data will be shared with other local wage survey committees when the data from any one company is ap-plicable to more than one special wage area. (3) For each area, survey job descrip- tions shall be tailored to correspond to the position of each covered supervisor in that area. They will be described at one of four levels (I, II, III, or IV) cor-responding to the definitions of the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. A description of the craft, trade, or labor work supervised will be included in each supervisory survey job description. (d) Special wage area boundaries shall be identical to the survey areas covered by the special wage surveys. The areas of application in which the special schedules will be paid are gen-erally smaller than the survey areas, reflecting actual Bureau of Reclama-tion worksites and the often scattered location of surveyable private sector jobs.

It touches on important legal protections related to VA payments, which could be crucial for employees, HR specialists, legal professionals, and financial advisors dealing with garnishment and debt collection issues. The question demonstrates a practical information need about the limits of wage garnishment, which is directly related to Title 5 topics concerning employee compensation and financial rights. While not covering the broadest possible scope of federal employment regulations, it addresses a specific and important aspect of employee financial protections that could have significant real-world implications for federal workers and veterans receiving VA benefits. The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for precise regulatory information, making it valuable for those seeking to understand the nuanced protections afforded to federal employees and veterans."
" If an employee is offered reemployment but fails to accept the offer, what are the potential consequences for their reemployment rights?
"," Per §352.706(b), an employee's entitlement to reemployment terminates if they fail to accept an offer of reemployment within 10 calendar days of receipt, and the offer is determined by the employing agency or the Merit Systems Protection Board to be a proper offer of reemployment. This means the employee would lose their right to be reinstated in their previous position or a comparable role.","['under the fol-lowing conditions. The individual must apply in writing to the former employ-ing agency for reemployment not later than 30 calendar days after: (1) Receipt of notice of involuntary separation from tribal employment. For this purpose, involuntary separa-tion means any separation against the will and without consent of the indi-vidual. (2) Reversion of the function to Fed- eral operation, whether reversion is through tribal or Federal action; or (3) Separation with the joint consent of the tribal organization and the Fed-eral agency for reasons of personal hardship or other special cir-cumstances. (b) Termination. A former employee’s entitlement to reemployment termi-nates for: (1) Failure to apply for reemploy- ment within the time limit stated in paragraph (a) of this section; (2) Resignation from tribal service without the joint consent, described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, of the tribal organization and the Federal em-ployer; or (3) Failure to accept, within 10 cal- endar days of receipt thereof, an offer of reemployment made under §352.706 which is determined by the employing agency or by the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board on appeal to be a proper offer of reemployment. § 352.706 Agency response to reem- ployment application. (a) Employee’s right to reemployment. An employee is entitled to be reem-ployed by the reemploying agency as promptly as possible, and, in any event, within 45 calendar days after agency receipt of application. (1) Within the competitive area the employee is entitled to reemployment in: (i) The position held immediately be- fore leaving the agency; (ii) One in the same competitive level; or (iii) Another position for which quali- fied and eligible at the same grade or level and in the same competitive area as the position the employee last held in the agency. The employing agency determines the position under para-graph (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this sec-tion to which the employee is entitled. Reduction-in-force procedures shall be applied where necessary in determining the position to which the employee has a right. In applying the reduction-in- force regulations, the applicant shall be considered an employee of the agen-cy. (2) Extending the area. Responsibility for reemploying an applicant is nation- wide within the agency. If the appli-cant is not placed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the agency must extend reemployment rights, based on the employee’s availability, for assign-ment outside the competitive area. The employee is entitled to a position, for which qualified and eligible, at the same grade or level as the position last held in the agency. Where necessary, reduction-in-force procedures shall be applied in determining the position to which the employee has a right. The applicant shall be considered an em-ployee for the purpose of applying the reduction-in-force regulations. (b) Employee option. Before the com- petitive area is extended under para-graph (a)(2) of this section, an em-ployee who cannot be placed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the competitive area at the same grade or level as the position last held is enti-tled, if the employee elects, to reem-ployment in a position at a lower grade VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00308 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR299 Office of Personnel Management § 352.803 or level identified under the same con- ditions and procedures as paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (c) Agency option. At any stage in the process, the agency has the option to satisfy the employee’s right to reem-ployment by offering a vacant position which, under reduction-in-force regula-tions, is in accord with the employee’s rights. Also, with the employee’s con-sent, right to reemployment can be met by placement in a vacant position, for which the employee is qualified ac-cording to agency determination, and available, outside the organizational or geographic area of entitlement, either at the appropriate grade or at a grade other than the one to which entitled. (d) Reemployment to an SES position. When the employee’s right is to a posi-tion in the SES, reemployment or re-turn may be to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified. The employee shall be returned at not less than the SES rate of basic pay as determined under 5 CFR part 534, sub-part D at which the employee was being paid immediately before his or her transfer. (e) Basis for agency refusal to reemploy. An agency may refuse to reemploy when the employee was last separated from tribal employment for serious cause establishing unsuitability for re-employment. (f) Basis for agency inability to reem- ploy. An agency may find it is unable to reemploy in the event no position can be found under procedures in this section.

(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the re-lease of official records and informa-tion, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a pro-tective order or execute a confiden-tiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confiden-tiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been exe-cuted, OPM may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protec-tive order or confidentiality agree-ment. (b) If the General Counsel so deter- mines, original OPM records may be presented for examination in response to a demand or request, but they are not to be presented as evidence or oth-erwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identify as official OPM records, and they are not to be marked or altered.

The agency must in-clude an explanation of how it will deal with perceived inequities among agen-cy employees (e.g., situations in which employees in positions designated as critical would receive higher rates of pay than their peers, supervisors, or other employees in positions with high-er-level duties and responsibilities); (13) Documentation of the effect on the successful accomplishment of im-portant agency missions if the position is not designated as a critical position, including an explanation and justifica-tion for OPM and OMB to expedite processing in cases where the agency believes that urgency warrants expe-dited processing; (14) Any additional information the agency may deem appropriate to dem-onstrate that higher pay is needed to recruit or retain an employee for a critical position; (15) Unless the position is an Execu- tive Schedule position, a copy of the position description and qualification standard for the critical position; and (16) The desired rate of basic pay for requests to set pay above the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and justification to show that such a rate is necessary to recruit and retain an individual exceptionally well-qualified for the critical position. § 535.105 Setting and adjusting rates of basic pay. (a) The rate of basic pay for a critical position may not be less than the rate of basic pay, including any locality- based comparability payments estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or special rate supplement under 5 U.S.C. 5305 (or other similar payment or supplement under other legal authority) that would otherwise be payable for the po-sition. (b) If critical position pay authority is granted for a position, the head of an agency may set pay initially at any amount up to the rate of pay for level II or level I of the Executive Schedule, as applicable, without further approval unless a higher maximum rate is ap-proved by the President under §535.104(c). (c) The head of an agency may make subsequent adjustments in the rate of basic pay for a critical position each January at the same time general pay adjustments are authorized for Execu-tive Schedule employees under section 5318 of title 5, United States Code. Such adjusted rates may not exceed the new rate for Executive Schedule level II or other applicable maximum established for the critical position. However, the employee must have at least a rating of Fully Successful or equivalent, and subsequent adjustments must be based on labor market factors, recruitment and retention needs, and individual ac-complishments and contributions to an agency’s mission. (d) Employees receiving critical posi- tion pay are not entitled to locality- based comparability payments estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate supplements under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or other similar payments or supplements under other legal authority. (e) If an agency discontinues critical position pay for a given position (on its own initiative or because OPM, in con-sultation with OMB, terminates the authority under §535.103(d)), the em-ployee’s rate of basic pay will be set at the rate to which the employee would be entitled had he or she not received critical pay, as determined by the head of the agency, unless the employee is eligible for a higher payable rate under the General Schedule maximum pay-able rate rule in §531.221 and the agen-cy chooses to apply that rule. § 535.106 Treatment as rate of basic pay.

BASIC PROVISIONS § 551.501 Overtime pay. (a) An agency shall compensate an employee who is not exempt under sub-part B of this part for all hours of work in excess of 8 in a day or 40 in a work-week at a rate equal to one and one- half times the employee’s hourly reg-ular rate of pay, except that an em-ployee shall not receive overtime com-pensation under this part— (1) On the basis of periods of duty in excess of 8 hours in a day when the em-ployee receives compensation for that duty under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or (2) or 5545b; (2) On the basis of hours of work in excess of 8 hours in a day that are not overtime hours of work under §410.402 of this chapter, part 532 of this chapter and 5 U.S.C. 5544, or part 550 of this chapter; (3) On the basis of hours of work in excess of 8 hours in a day for an em-ployee covered by 5 U.S.C. 5544 for any hours in a standby or on-call status or while sleeping or eating; (4) On the basis of hours of work in excess of 8 hours in a day for an indi-vidual who is not an employee, as de-fined in 5 U.S.C. 5541(2), for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 5542, 5543, and 5544; (5) On the basis of hours of work in excess of 40 hours in a workweek for an employee engaged in fire protection or law enforcement activities when the employee is receiving compensation under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or (2) or 5545b, or is not an employee (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5541(2)) for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 5542, 5543, and 5544; (6) For hours of work that are not ‘‘overtime hours,’’ as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121, for employees under flexi-ble or compressed work schedules; (7) For hours of work compensated by compensatory time off under §551.531 of this part; and (8) For fractional hours of work, ex- cept as provided in §551.521 of this part. (b) An employee’s ‘‘workweek’’ is a fixed and recurring period of 168 hours—seven consecutive 24-hour peri-ods. It need not coincide with the cal-endar week but may begin on any day and at any hour of a day. For employ-ees subject to part 610 of this chapter, the workweek shall be the same as the administrative workweek defined in §610.102 of this chapter. (c) In this subpart, ‘‘irregular or oc- casional overtime work’’ is overtime work that is not scheduled in advance of the employee’s workweek. (d) The maximum earnings limita- tions described in §§550.105, 550.106, and 550.107 of this chapter do not apply to overtime pay due the employee under this subpart.

(See definition of ‘‘emer-gency’’ in §550.103.) (2) The head of an agency (or des- ignee) must make the determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as soon as practicable after the work in connection with the emergency or its aftermath begins. Entitlement to pre-mium pay under this annual limitation becomes effective on the first day of the pay period in which such work began. (b)(1) For any pay period in which the head of an agency (or designee), in his or her sole discretion, determines that an employee is needed to perform work that is critical to the mission of the agency, the agency may pay premium pay under the limitations described in paragraph (c) of this section and §550.107 instead of under the biweekly limitation described in §550.105(a). (2) Entitlement to premium pay under this annual limitation becomes effective on the first day of the pay pe-riod designated by the head of the agency (or designee). (c) In any calendar year during which an employee has been determined to be performing emergency or mission-crit-ical work as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the employee may receive premium pay under this subpart (excluding the types of pre-mium pay identified in §550.107) only to the extent that the payment does not cause the total of his or her basic pay and premium pay for the calendar year to exceed the greater of— (1) The maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for GS–15 (including any applicable locality-based com-parability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law and any ap-plicable special rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar provision of law) in effect on the last day of the calendar year; or (2) The annual rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule in effect on the last day of the calendar year. (d) The annual rates under para- graphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section must be computed as follows: (1) Compute an hourly rate by divid- ing the published annual rate of basic pay by 2,087 hours and rounding the re-sult to the nearest cent; (2) Compute a biweekly rate by mul- tiplying the hourly rate from para-graph (d)(1) of this section by 80 hours; (3) Compute an annual rate of pay by multiplying the biweekly rate from paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the number of pay periods for which a sal-ary payment is issued in the given cal-endar year under the agency’s payroll cycle ( i.e., either 26 or 27 pay periods). (e) An agency may defer payment of some or all of the additional premium pay owed an employee as a result of the annual limitation until the end of the calendar year. (f) Any payment made in the current calendar year that corrects an under-payment of premium pay in a previous calendar year must be treated as being made in the previous calendar year for the purpose of applying the annual cap under this section. (g) If an agency determines that the emergency or mission-critical work conditions are no longer in effect for an employee, it must resume application of the biweekly limitation. However, any premium pay the employee re-ceives during the remainder of the cal-endar year is also subject to the annual limitation (as applied to any given pay period as described in paragraph (c) of this section).

2. Practicality: Addresses a real-world scenario that employees and HR professionals might encounter, especially in situations involving furloughs, reorganizations, or position changes
3. Information Need: Seeks to understand the legal and procedural consequences of a specific employment decision
4. Applicability: Provides valuable insights for employees considering reemployment options and HR specialists managing workforce transitions

The question would help stakeholders understand:

- Specific consequences of declining a reemployment offer
- Rights and obligations in reemployment scenarios

Any negative balance of religious compen-satory time off remaining after any charging of these types of paid time off must be resolved by charging the em-ployee leave without pay, which would result in an indebtedness that is sub-ject to the agency’s internal debt col-lection procedures.

The overtime hours worked to earn religious compensatory time off under this subpart do not create an en-titlement to premium pay (including overtime pay) under subpart A of this part or FLSA overtime pay under 5 CFR part 551.

SOURCE : 49 FR 27472, July 3, 1984, unless otherwise noted. § 550.1101 Purpose. This subpart provides the standards to be used by Federal agencies to pre-pare regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 and by OPM to review and approve such agency regulations, and estab-lishes procedural guidelines to recover debts from the current pay account of an employee when the employee’s cred-itor and paying agencies are not the same. § 550.1102 Scope. (a) Coverage. This subpart applies to agencies and employees defined by §550.1103. (b) Applicability. This subpart and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in recovering certain debts by administrative offset, except where the employee consents to the re-covery, from the current pay account of the employee. Because salary offset is a type of administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and these regulations should be con-sistent with the provisions of the Fed-eral Claims Collections Standards (FCCS) (dealing with administrative offset generally) and 31 CFR part 285 (dealing with centralized administra-tive offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716). Sec-tion 550.1108 addresses the use of cen-tralized administrative offset proce-dures to effect salary offset. Generally, the procedures under §550.1109 should apply only when centralized adminis-trative offset cannot be accomplished. (1) Excluded debts.

(a) An agency may establish tem- porary transitional Schedule C posi-tions necessary to assist a department or agency head during the 1-year period immediately following a change in presidential administration, when a new department or agency head has en-tered on duty, or when a new depart-ment or agency is created. These posi-tions may be established only to meet legitimate needs of the agency in car-rying out its mission during the period of transition associated with such changeovers. They must be of a con-fidential or policy-determining char-acter and are subject to instructions issued by OPM. (b) The number of temporary transi- tional Schedule C positions established by an agency cannot exceed either 50 percent of the highest number of per-manent Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the pre-vious 5 years, or three positions, whichever is higher. In the event a new department or agency is created, the number of temporary transitional posi-tions should reasonable in light of the size and program responsibility of that department or agency. OPM may ap-prove an increase in an agency’s quota to meet a critical need or in unusual circumstances.

For the purposes of this part: Agency, Senior Executive Service posi- tion, career appointee, limited term ap-pointee, limited emergency appointee, and noncareer appointee have the meanings set forth in section 3132(a) of title 5, United States Code. Equivalent position as used in section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, means a position under any pay system where the level of the duties and re-sponsibilities of the', 'out situation covered in §330.404 has inter-agency selection priority under the Interagency Career Transition Assist-ance Plan, which is authorized by sub-part G of this part. (b) A preference eligible covered by this subpart is eligible for the Inter-agency Career Transition Assistance Plan for 2 years following separation by reduction in force from a restricted position. Subpart E—Restrictions To Protect Competitive Principles § 330.501 Purpose. The restrictions in this subpart are designed to prevent circumvention of the open competitive examination sys-tem defined in Civil Service Rule 1.3 (5 CFR 1.3). These restrictions limit an appointee’s immediate movement to another position after appointment from a competitive certificate of eligi-bles. § 330.502 General restriction on move- ment after competitive appoint-ment. (a) An agency must wait at least 90 days after an employee’s latest non-temporary competitive appointment before the agency may take the fol-lowing actions: (1) Promote an employee; (2) Transfer, reinstate, reassign, or detail an employee to a different posi-tion; or (3) Transfer, reinstate, reassign, or detail an employee to a different geo-graphical area. (b) Upon written request from an agency, OPM may waive the restriction against movement to a different geo-graphical area when moving such an employee is consistent with open com-petition principles. § 330.503 Ensuring agency compliance with the principles of open competi-tion. OPM will review appointments made from competitive examinations and subsequent position changes to deter-mine if agencies are complying with open competition principles. The fact that an agency waited 90 days to make the changes, as required under this subpart, is not an absolute protection. If OPM finds that an agency has not complied with these principles, either in an individual instance or on a pro-gram-wide basis, OPM will order an agency to correct the situation. § 330.504 Exception to the general re- striction. The restrictions in this subpart do not apply to a person who is eligible for a competitive appointment from a cer-tificate of eligibles under part 332 of this chapter.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 330.602 agency selection priority for the agen- cy’s eligible surplus and displaced em-ployees. This subpart sets forth min-imum requirements for agency plans and establishes requirements for CTAP selection priority. (b) Consistent with these regulations and at their discretion, an agency may supplement these requirements to ex-pand career transition opportunities to its surplus and displaced workers. (c) With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate place-ment program that satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart as an ex-ception to CTAP selection priority under this subpart. This provision al-lows agencies to adopt different place-ment strategies that are effective for their programs while satisfying em-ployee entitlements to selection pri-ority. § 330.602 Definitions. For purposes of this subpart: Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. CTAP eligible means an agency sur- plus or displaced employee who has a current performance rating of record of at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent. As used in this subpart, ‘‘CTAP eligible’’ and ‘‘eligible’’ are synonymous. CTAP selection priority candidate means a CTAP eligible who applied for and was determined to be well-quali-fied by the agency and whom the agen-cy must select over any other appli-cant for the vacancy, unless the action to be taken is listed as an exception under §330.609. Displaced describes an agency em- ployee in one of the following two cat-egories: (1) A current career or career-condi- tional (tenure group I or II) competi-tive service employee at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below who: (i) Received a reduction in force (RIF) separation notice under part 351 of this chapter and has not declined an offer under part 351, subpart G, of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and a represent-ative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee will be separated; or (ii) Received a notice of proposed re- moval under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geographic reloca-tion outside of the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reassignment or change in duty station). (2) A current excepted service em- ployee on an appointment without time limit at grade level GS–15 (or equivalent) or below who: (i) Is covered by a law providing both noncompetitive appointment eligi-bility to, and selection priority for, competitive service positions; and (ii) Received a RIF separation notice under part 351 of this chapter or a no-tice of proposed removal under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geographic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reas-signment or a change in duty station). Surplus describes an agency employee in one of the following three cat-egories: (1) A current career or career-condi- tional (tenure group I or II) competi-tive service employee at grade GS–15 (or equivalent) or below who received a Certification of Expected Separation under part 351 of this chapter or other official agency certification or notifi-cation indicating that the employee’s position is surplus (for example, a no-tice of position abolishment or a notice of eligibility for discontinued service retirement). (2) A current excepted service em- ployee on an appointment without time limit at grade GS–15 (or equiva-lent) or below who: (i) Is covered by a law providing both noncompetitive appointment eligi-bility to, and selection priority for, competitive service positions; and (ii) Received a Certification of Ex- pected Separation under part 351 of this chapter or other official agency certification or notification indicating that the employee’s position is surplus (for example, a notice of position abol-ishment or a notice of eligibility for discontinued service retirement).

(c) The new employing agency must appoint the Recent Graduate without a break in service. (d) Time served under the previous agency’s Recent Graduates Program is credited toward the Program require-ments for noncompetitive conversion eligibility to the competitive service. Because there is no break in service, the Recent Graduate does not begin a new period in the Program upon mov-ing to the new agency. (e) The new employing agency’s plan must identify requirements for Pro-gram completion and eligibility for noncompetitive conversion. § 362.305 Conversion to the competi- tive service. (a) An agency may noncompetitively convert a Recent Graduate who is a U.S. citizen to a competitive service term or permanent position when the Recent Graduate has: (1) Successfully completed at least 1- year of continuous service in addition to all the requirements of the Recent Graduates Program; (2) Demonstrated successful job per- formance consistent with the applica-ble performance appraisal program es-tablished under the agency’s approved performance appraisal system that re-sults in a rating of record (or summary rating) of at least Fully Successful or equivalent and a recommendation for conversion by the first-level super-visor; and (3) Met the OPM Qualification Stand- ard for the competitive service position to which the Recent Graduate will be converted. (b) An agency must make the non- competitive conversion effective on the date the service requirement is met, or at the end of an agency-approved ex-tension, if applicable. (c) A Recent Graduate may be con- verted to a permanent or term position at a different agency when the fol-lowing conditions are met: (1) The employing (or losing) agency is unable to convert the Recent Grad-uate to a term or permanent position in the competitive service in the cur-rent organizational unit of the employ-ing agency or another component with-in the same Department or agency. The reasons for conversion at another agen-cy may include unforeseen budgetary constraints; reorganizations; abolish-ment of positions; completion of co-hort-based Pathways programs; or other appropriate reasons. Such a con-version to another agency may not be due to issues related to misconduct, poor performance, or suitability; (2) Conversion must occur on or be- fore the end of the agency prescribed Program period, plus any agency-ap-proved extension; and (3) The position at the new agency must have a full performance level that is equivalent or less than the posi-tion they would have been converted to at the prior agency.

For purposes of this subpart: Agency Presidential Management Fel- lows (PMF) Program Coordinator is an individual, at the appropriate agency component level, who coordinates the placement, development, and other Program-related activities of PMFs ap-pointed in his or her agency and fulfills the criteria described in §362.104(a)(8). The agency Pathways Programs Officer may also serve as the PMF Coordi-nator. Executive Resources Board (ERB) has the same meaning as specified in §317.501(a) of this section; in those agencies that are not required to have an ERB pursuant to that section, it means the senior agency official or of-ficials who have been given responsi-bility for executive resources manage-ment and oversight by the agency head. Presidential Management Fellow (PMF) or Fellow is an individual appointed, at the GS–9, GS–11, or GS–12 level (or equivalent under a non-GS pay and classification system such as the Fed-eral Wage System), in the excepted service under §213.3402(c) of this chap-ter.

(a) The Director may determine the number of Fellows who may be ap-pointed during any given year. This de-termination will be based on input from the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, as well as input from agencies not represented on the Council. (b) Thereafter, subject to the provi- sions and requirements of this chapter, an agency may appoint individuals se-lected by the Director as Fellows final-ists according to its short-, medium-, and long-term senior leadership and re-lated (senior policy, professional, tech-nical, and equivalent) recruitment, de-velopment, and succession require-ments. (c) The Director will establish the qualification requirements for evalu-ating applicants for the PMF Program. (d) An agency that hires Fellows in field locations outside the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area may: (1) In advance of making the appoint- ment, discuss whether the finalist wants to do a developmental rotation to agency headquarters and, if so, make a commitment to allow and fund such a rotation, to the maximum ex-tent practicable, in accordance with §362.405(b) of this part; and (2) Promote interaction among re- gional Fellows with the agency Federal Executive Board (FEB) and permit Fel-lows to attend FEB-sanctioned activi-ties in that region. § 362.403 Announcement, eligibility, and selection. (a) OPM will announce the oppor- tunity to apply for the PMF Program and conduct a competition for the se-lection of finalists as set forth in this section. (b) A Presidential Management Fel- low is an individual who, within the previous 2 years, completed an ad-vanced degree from a qualifying edu-cational institution. (c) An individual may apply for the PMF Program if: (1) The individual has obtained an ad- vanced degree within the 2-year period preceding the Program announcement described in paragraph (a) of this sec-tion, or (2) The individual is still a student attending a qualifying educational in-stitution, as defined in paragraph (2)(iii) of the definition of Qualifying educational institution in §362.102, and he or she expects to complete a quali-fying advanced degree', 'with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup; and (2) Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equiva-lent) below the position from which the employee was released, except that for a preference eligible employee with a compensable service-connected dis-ability of 30 percent or more the limit is five grades (or appropriate grade in-tervals or equivalent). (The agency uses the grade progression of only the released employee’s position of record to determine the applicable grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equiva-lent) of the employee’s retreat right. The agency does not consider the grade progression of the position to which the employee has a retreat right.); and (3) Is the same position, or an essen- tially identical position, formerly held by the released employee on a perma-nent basis as a competing employee in a Federal agency ( i.e., when held by the released employee in an executive, leg- islative, or judicial branch agency, the position would have been placed in ten-ure groups I, II, or III, or equivalent). In determining whether a position is essentially identical, the determina-tion is based on the competitive level criteria found in §351.403, but not nec-essarily in regard to the respective grade, classification series, type of work schedule, or type of service, of the two positions. (d) Limitation. An employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent may be assigned under paragraph (c) of this section only to a position held by another employee with a current annual performance rating of record no higher than minimally suc-cessful (Level 2) or equivalent. (e) Pay rates. (1) The determination of equivalent grade intervals shall be based on a comparison of representa-tive rates. (2) Each employee’s assignment rights shall be determined on the basis of the pay rates in effect on the date of issuance of specific reduction-in-force notices, except that when it is offi-cially known on the date of issuance of notices that new pay rates have been approved and will become effective by the effective date of the reduction in force, assignment rights shall be deter-mined on the basis of the new pay rates. (f)(1) In determining applicable grades (or grade intervals) under §§351.701(b)(2) and 351.701(c)(2), the agency uses the grade progression of the released employee’s position of record to determine the grade (or inter-val) limits of the employee’s assign-ment rights. (2) For positions covered by the Gen- eral Schedule, the agency must deter-mine whether a one-grade, two-grade, or mixed grade interval progression is applicable to the position of the re-leased employee.

The normal line of progression may include positions in different pay systems. (4) For positions where no grade structure exists, the agency determines a line of progression for each occupa-tion and pay rate, and provides assign-ment rights to positions within three grades (or intervals) lower on that basis. (5) If the released employee holds a position that is less than three grades above the lowest grade in the applica-ble classification system (e.g., the em-ployee holds a GS–2 position), the agen-cy provides the released employee with assignment rights up to three actual grades lower on a one-grade basis in other pay systems. (g) If a competitive area includes more than one local commuting area, the agency determines assignment rights under this part on the basis of the representative rates for one local commuting area within the competi-tive area ( i.e., the same local com- muting area used to establish competi-tive levels under §351.403(c)(4), (5), and (6)).

1. There is a high likelihood the employee will be separated through RIF procedures
2. Employment opportunities in the same or similar position in the local commuting area are limited
3. Placement opportunities within federal agencies in the local commuting area are limited
4. The employee has not filed for retirement or indicated intent to retire (if eligible for optional retirement)

The certification can be issued up to 6 months before the expected RIF date and is designed to help employees access workforce assistance programs. Importantly, this certification cannot be used to satisfy notice requirements and its eligibility determination cannot be appealed to OPM or the Merit Systems Protection Board.","['as constituting additional FLSA overtime pay. (This method does not apply to nondiscretionary bonuses established as a percentage of a seg-ment of pay, such as ratings-based cash awards under §451.104(g) of this chapter that are expressed as a percentage of basic pay, excluding locality adjust-ments. To meet overtime pay require-ments for these types of bonuses, use one of the methods described in para-graphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.) (c) Group-based bonus distribution methods. (1) For employees who have earned nondiscretionary group cash awards or bonuses, payment of a bonus under one of the methods of distribu-tion described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section is considered to be in full compliance with the overtime pay requirements of this subpart. These methods may not be used to cir-cumvent any bonus limitations that might otherwise apply. (2) Percentage method. (i) Identify the amount of the group bonus under the agency’s bonus plan and the period of time during which it was earned; (ii) Establish the group bonus as a percentage of the total pay ( i.e., total remuneration before considering the group bonus, including straight time pay for any overtime hours, plus any half-rate overtime pay under §551.512(a)(2)) earned by employees in the group during the bonus period; and (iii) Multiply the percentage in para-graph (c)(2)(ii) of this section times each individual employee’s total pay earned during the bonus period to de-termine each employee’s share of the group bonus. (3) Boosted hour method. (i) Identify the amount of the group bonus under the agency’s bonus plan and the period of time during which it was earned; (ii) Determine the total number of boosted hours for all employees under the group bonus plan by adding up the total number of hours of work by those employees (nonovertime and overtime hours) and increasing that sum by one- half of the total number of overtime hours; (iii) Divide the amount of the group bonus by the total number of boosted hours for all employees under the group bonus plan to determine the amount of the bonus allocable to each hour; and (iv) Multiply this hourly bonus amount by the number of boost-ed hours credited to each individual employee in the bonus period to deter-mine each employee’s share of the group bonus.

An employee may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or co-erce, or attempt to intimidate, threat-en, or coerce any other employee for the purpose of interfering with such employee’s rights to request or not to request compensatory time off in lieu of payment for overtime hours. (d) If compensatory time off earned under paragraph (a) or (b) of this sec-tion is not taken within 26 pay periods after the pay period during which it was earned or if the employee transfers or separates from an agency before using the compensatory time, the em-ployee must be paid for overtime work at the dollar value prescribed in para-graph (g) of this section.

When taking a personnel action that results from a decision or order of OPM, the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board, Equal Employment Op-portunity Commission, or Federal Labor Relations Authority, as author-ized by the rules and regulations of those agencies, or as the result of a court order, a judicial or administra-tive settlement agreement, or an arbi-tral award under a negotiated agree-ment, the agency must follow the in-structions in the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions and comply with all other relevant substantive and docu-mentary requirements, including those applicable to retirement, life insur-ance, health benefits, and other bene-fits provided under this chapter. § 250.102 Delegated authorities. OPM may delegate its authority, in- cluding authority for competitive ex-aminations, to agencies, under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2), through a delegation agree-ment. The delegation agreement devel-oped with the agency must specify the conditions for applying the delegated authorities. The agreement must also set minimum standards of performance and describe the system of oversight by which the agency and OPM will mon-itor the use of each delegated author-ity. § 250.103 Consequences of improper agency actions. If OPM finds that an agency has taken an action contrary to a law, rule, regulation, or standard that OPM administers, OPM may require the agency to take corrective action. OPM may suspend or revoke a delegation agreement established under §250.102 at any time if it determines that the VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR82 5 CFR Ch.

OPM may sus-pend or withdraw any authority grant-ed under this chapter to an agency, in-cluding any authority granted by dele-gation agreement, when OPM finds that the agency has not complied with qualification standards OPM has issued, instructions OPM has pub-lished, or the regulations in this chap-ter. OPM also may suspend or with-draw these authorities when it deter-mines that doing so is in the interest of the civil service for any other reason.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1103(c), this sub- part defines a set of systems, including standards and metrics, for assessing the management of human capital by Federal agencies. These regulations apply to agencies covered by 31 U.S.C. 901(b) of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101–576), as well as 5 U.S.C. 1401 and support the performance planning and reporting that is required by sections 1115(a)(3) and (f) and 1116(d)(5) of title 31, United States Code. [83 FR 55931, Nov. 9, 2018] § 250.202 Definitions. Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) is the agency’s senior leader whose pri-mary duty is to: (1) Advise and assist the head of the agency and other agency officials in carrying out the agency’s responsibil-ities for selecting, developing, training, and managing a high-quality, produc- tive workforce in accordance with merit system principles; and (2) Implement the rules and regula- tions of the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the laws governing the civil service within the agency. CHCO agency is an Executive agency, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, which is re-quired by 5 U.S.C. 1401 and 31 U.S.C. 901(b)(1) to appoint a CHCO. Director of OPM is, among other things, the President’s advisor on ac-tions that may be taken to promote an efficient civil service and a systematic application of the merit system prin-ciples, including recommending poli-cies relating to the selection, pro-motion, transfer, performance, pay, conditions of service, tenure, and sepa-ration of employees. The Director of OPM provides governmentwide leader-ship and direction in the strategic management of the Federal workforce. Evaluation system is an agency’s over- arching system for evaluating the re-sults of all human capital planning and implementation of human capital strategies to inform the agency’s con-tinuous process improvement efforts. This system is also used for ensuring compliance with all applicable stat-utes, rules, regulations, and agency policies. Federal Workforce Priorities Report (FWPR) is a strategic human capital report, published by OPM by the first Monday in February of any year in which the term of the President com-mences. OPM may extend the date of publication if needed. The report com-municates key Governmentwide human capital priorities and suggested strate-gies. The report also informs agency strategic and human capital planning. Focus areas are areas that agencies and human capital practitioners must focus on to achieve a system’s stand-ard. HRStat is a strategic human capital performance evaluation process that identifies, measures, and analyzes human capital data to inform the im-pact of an agency’s human capital management on organizational results with the intent to improve human cap-ital outcomes. HRStat, which is a quarterly review process, is a compo-nent']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the ""Certificate of Expected Separation"" that an agency can issue to employees facing a reduction in force, including specific eligibility criteria such as a high likelihood of separation, limited employment opportunities, and other conditions, which allows for a comprehensive answer to the question with only minor details potentially missing.",5,"This is an exceptionally useful question for multiple stakeholders in federal employment. The question addresses a critical and complex aspect of workforce management during Reduction in Force (RIF) scenarios, which directly impacts employees' job security and future employment prospects. 

The question is highly relevant to Title 5 regulations, specifically addressing workforce restructuring procedures. It seeks to understand a specific certification that can potentially mitigate the negative impacts of a RIF, which is of immense practical value to:

1. Employees facing potential job loss
2. HR specialists managing RIF processes
3. Managers involved in workforce planning
4. Union representatives negotiating employee protections
5. Career counselors assisting displaced federal workers

The query demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the nuanced protections available during organizational downsizing. By asking about a ""unique certification"" and its ""specific eligibility criteria,"" the question shows a desire for precise, actionable information that could help employees navigate a challenging professional transition.

This type of question goes beyond surface-level understanding and seeks to uncover specific mechanisms that can help federal employees maintain employment continuity or improve their reemployment prospects during organizational restructuring. The practical implications for career preservation and workforce mobility make this an extremely valuable inquiry into federal employment regulations."
" Under what conditions can an employee transfer annual leave to another employee's leave account during a medical emergency?

This subpart prescribes the regula- tions authorized by section 5903 of title 5, United States Code, for the payment of uniform allowances. § 591.102 Definitions. Agency means an ‘‘Executive agen- cy,’’ as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. Employee means an employee in or under an agency. Category of employees means any group of employees designated by an agency that has the same basic uni-form requirements. Head of agency means the head of an agency or an official who has been del-egated the authority to act for the head of the agency in the matter con-cerned. Uniform means a specified article or articles of clothing that may include, but is not limited to, such items as shoes, boots, hats, shirts, slacks, skirts, or outerwear an employee is re-quired by an agency to wear to provide a distinctive and easily identifiable ap-pearance in performing his or her job. A ‘‘uniform’’ does not include protec-tive equipment required for the em-ployee’s safety under 5 U.S.C. 7903 or normal business or work attire pur- chased at the discretion of the em-ployee.

Unless a higher initial maximum uni- form allowance rate is payable under §591.104 to an employee who is required by statute, regulation, or an agency’s written administrative procedures to wear a uniform, the head of each agen- cy concerned, out of funds available, shall— (a) Pay an allowance for a uniform not to exceed $800 a year; or (b) Furnish a uniform at a cost not to exceed $800 a year. (c) Any agency which provides a uni- form allowance under paragraph (a) of this section must establish policies to administer the uniform allowance pro-gram, including uniform standards ac-ceptable to the agency. [59 FR 43705, Aug. 25, 1994, as amended at 72 FR 20702, Apr. 26, 2007] § 591.104 Higher initial maximum uni- form allowance rate. (a) The head of an agency may estab- lish one or more initial maximum uni-form allowance rates greater than the Governmentwide maximum uniform al-lowance rate established under §591.103. (b) A higher initial maximum uni- form allowance rate established under this section may not exceed the aver-age total uniform cost for the min-imum basic uniform for the affected employees and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, applies only to the year in which the employee becomes subject to a requirement to wear the uniform. (c) An agency that establishes one or more higher initial maximum uniform allowance rates under this section may divide the cost of the minimum basic uniform and continue a higher initial maximum uniform allowance for the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the require-ment to wear the uniform, provided the agency publishes a notice of its inten-tion to continue such payments in the F EDERAL REGISTER for notice and com- ment. (d) Before establishing a higher ini- tial maximum uniform allowance rate under this section, an agency shall publish in the F EDERAL REGISTER for notice and comment— (1) A description and justification of the circumstances requiring a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate; (2) An estimate of the number of em- ployees affected; (3) The specific items required for the basic uniform and the average total uniform cost for the affected employ-ees; (4) The amount of the proposed high- er initial maximum uniform allowance rate to be paid during the year the em-ployee first becomes subject to the uni-form requirement; (5) The proposed effective date of the higher initial maximum uniform allow-ance rate; and, (6) The intent of the agency (if any) to divide the cost of a minimum basic uniform and continue to make higher initial maximum basic uniform allow-ance payments in the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the uniform requirement. (e) So that OPM can evaluate agen- cies’ use of this authority and provide the Congress and others with informa-tion regarding the use of a higher ini-tial maximum uniform allowance rate, each agency concerned shall maintain such other records and submit to OPM such other reports and data as OPM shall require. (f) When OPM determines that an agency is using this authority inappro-priately, OPM may require its prior ap-proval before that agency establishes any future higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate. (g) An agency may increase a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate only as']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the voluntary leave transfer program, including conditions such as the leave recipient needing to have a medical emergency requiring at least 24 hours of leave without pay, the ability to transfer leave only within the same agency (with some exceptions), and the process for verifying and transferring leave, which covers most aspects of the question.",5,"This is an excellent and highly practical question that directly addresses a critical aspect of federal employee leave policies under Title 5. The question focuses on the specific conditions for leave transfer during medical emergencies, which is a nuanced but important employee support mechanism. This information would be extremely valuable to:

1. HR Specialists: They need to understand the precise conditions and procedures for implementing leave transfers.
2. Federal Employees: Those facing medical emergencies or wanting to support colleagues in need would benefit from knowing their options.
3. Managers: Understanding these policies helps them support employee welfare and navigate complex leave management scenarios.

The question demonstrates a genuine information need about a specific regulatory provision that has direct, meaningful impact on federal workplace policies. It touches on employee assistance, compassionate workplace practices, and the administrative procedures surrounding leave management. The specificity of asking about ""medical emergency"" conditions shows a sophisticated understanding of the potential complexities in such transfers.

This type of question helps employees understand their rights, assists HR in implementing policies correctly, and provides clarity on an important employee support mechanism that goes beyond standard leave policies."
 What happens if an OPM organization receives a FOIA request for records it does not possess?," Per § 294.107(e), when an OPM organization receives a FOIA request for records it does not have, it will typically either:
1) Retrieve the records from the organization that has possession of them, or
2) Promptly forward the request to the appropriate organization

If a person has requested to be kept informed about any delays, OPM will provide notice of the forwarding action. Otherwise, OPM may, at its discretion, provide such notice.","['listed is within the category that is required to be in-dexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2).

(g) Records from other Government agencies. When a person seeks records that originated in another Government agency, OPM may refer the request to the other agency for response. Ordi-narily, OPM will provide notice of this type of referral. (h) Creating records. If a person seeks information from OPM in a format that does not currently exist, OPM will not ordinarily compile the information for the purpose of creating a record to respond to the request. OPM will ad-vise the individual that it does not have records in the format sought. If other existing records would reason-ably respond to the request or portions of it, OPM may provide these. If fees as provided in §294.109 apply to any alter-native records, OPM will advise the re-quester before providing the records. [54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 32150, July 21, 1992; 58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993] § 294.108 Procedures for obtaining records. (a) Mailing or delivering a request. Any person may ask for records under sec-tion 552 of title 5, United States Code, by directing a letter to one of the orga-nizations listed in §294.107, or by deliv-ering a request in person at the ad-dresses listed in that section during business hours on a regular business day. (b) Proper marking. Each request for records should have a clear and promi-nent notation on the first page, such as ‘‘Freedom of Information Act Re-quest.’’ In addition, if sent by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, mark the outside clearly and prominently with ‘‘FOIA Request’’ or ‘‘Freedom of Information Act Re-quest.’’ (c) Contents of request letter. A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OPM per-sonnel to locate the records with a rea-sonable amount of effort. (1) OPM will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph, if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive to OPM operations. (2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, re-cipient, and subject matter of the record. (3) If an OPM organization deter- mines that a request does not reason-ably describe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additional information needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. OPM will also offer the record seeker an op-portunity to confer, with the objective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirements of this section. (d) Medical records. OPM or another Government agency may disclose the medical records of an applicant, em-ployee, or annuitant to the subject of the record, or to a representative des-ignated in writing. However, medical records may contain information about an individual’s mental or physical con-dition that a prudent physician would hesitate to', 'even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position held by an em-ployee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a locality rate, a special rate under this subpart or a similar rate under 38 U.S.C. 7455, or a retained rate, but ex-cluding additional pay of any other kind. Rate range or range means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or similar rates under other legal author-ity. Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range appli-cable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Serv-ice, under 5 CFR 359.705. Special rate means a rate of pay with- in a special rate schedule established under this subpart. Special rate schedule means a pay schedule established under this subpart VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00409 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR400 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 530.303 to provide higher rates of pay for speci- fied categories of GS positions or em-ployees at one or more grades. An in-creased or decreased special rate sched-ule refers to an increase or decrease in one or more rate ranges within that schedule. Special rate supplement means the por- tion of a special rate paid above an em-ployee’s GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supple-ment equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer’s LEO spe-cial base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law en-forcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Exec-utive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in §530.304(a). [70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008] § 530.303 Coverage. (a) Under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may es- tablish special rates for employees paid under a statutory pay system (as de-fined in 5 U.S.C. 5302(1)) or any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for civilian positions in the executive branch. Special rates apply only to GS employees unless the approved schedule coverage criteria specifically state otherwise. OPM will establish special rate schedules cov-ering employees under a non-GS pay system only at the request of the agen-cy responsible for administering that system. For employees covered by a non-GS pay system, the responsible agency is subject to the requirements in 5 U.S.C. 5305. To the extent the stat-utory or regulatory provisions gov-erning the non-GS pay system differ from the regulatory provisions of this subpart, the responsible agency must follow policies that are consistent as possible with this subpart. (b) An employee’s coverage under a special rate schedule is subject to the coverage conditions established by OPM for that schedule, except as pro-vided in paragraph (c) of this section. The coverage conditions for a special rate schedule may be based on occupa-tion, grade, employing agency, geo-graphic location of official worksite, or other factors OPM may determine to be appropriate. An agency determina- tion as to whether an employee meets the coverage conditions for a special rate schedule must be based on the em-ployee’s position of record and official worksite. An agency also may be re-quired to consider other employee-spe-cific factors established by OPM to de-termine special rate coverage, such as special qualifications or certifications. (c) An agency must pay the applica- ble special rate to any employee who meets the coverage conditions estab-lished by OPM with respect to a special rate schedule unless an authorized agency official determines that a cat-egory of employees of the agency will not be covered by a proposed or exist-ing special rate schedule, subject to the following requirements: (1) An authorized agency official may determine that a category of employ-ees of the agency will not be covered by a special rate request or a proposed new special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The notice must be received by OPM before the effective date of the new special rate schedule. (2) An authorized agency official may remove a category of employees of the agency from coverage under an exist-ing special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The loss of coverage under a special rate schedule will become effective on the first day of the first pay period be-ginning on or after the date of the no-tice to OPM. (d) An employee covered by a special rate schedule is not entitled to a spe-cial rate for any purpose with respect to any period during which the em-ployee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other legal author-ity. For example, an employee is not entitled to a special rate if he or she is VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00410 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR401 Office of Personnel Management § 530.305 entitled', 'wave action.25 May 4, 1988.

(a) An agency must make a lump- sum payment for accumulated and ac-crued annual leave when an employee— (1) Separates or retires from the Fed-eral service; (2) Dies; or (3) Transfers to a position that is not covered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, and his or her accumulated and accrued annual leave cannot be transferred, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. (b) The Department of Defense (DOD) must make a lump-sum payment to an employee who has unused annual leave that was restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) when he or she transfers from a DOD installation undergoing closure or realignment to a position in any other department or agency of the Fed-eral Government or moves to a posi-tion within DOD not located at an in-stallation undergoing closure or re-alignment. (c) An employee who enters on active duty in the armed forces may elect to receive a lump-sum payment for accu-mulated and accrued annual leave or may request to have the annual leave remain to his or her credit until return from active duty. However, an agency must make a lump-sum payment for any annual leave previously restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) when the em-ployee enters active duty. The agency may not recredit the restored leave when the employee returns to Federal service. (d) An employee who transfers to a position in a public international orga-nization under 5 U.S.C. 3582 may elect to retain accumulated and accrued an-nual leave to his or her credit at the time of transfer or receive a lump-sum payment for such annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 3582(a)(4). However, the agency must make a lump-sum payment for any annual leave previously restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) when the em-ployee transfers to the public inter-national organization. The agency may not recredit the leave under these cir-cumstances. (e) An agency must make a lump-sum payment to an employee who transfers to a position excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(x)–(xiii) for any annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) upon transfer to an ex-cepted position. However, the agency may not make a lump-sum payment for any annual leave in the employee’s reg-ular leave account upon transfer to the excepted position. The agency must hold such annual leave in abeyance for recredit if the employee is subse-quently reemployed without a break in service in a position to which his or her accumulated and accrued annual leave may be transferred. If the employee later becomes eligible for a lump-sum payment under the conditions specified in this section, the current employing agency must make a lump-sum pay-ment for the annual leave held in abey-ance. The agency must compute the lump-sum payment under §550.1205(b) based on the pay the employee was re-ceiving immediately before the date of the transfer to the position excepted by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(x)–(xiii). An employee who elects to retain his or her leave benefits upon accepting a Presidential appointment, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), is not entitled to receive a lump-sum payment.

The agency must compute the lump-sum payment under §550.1205(b) based on the pay the employee was re-ceiving immediately before the date of the transfer to the position not covered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code. This does not apply to an employee transferring to an excepted position covered by para-graph (e) of this section.

The agency must compute the lump sum payment under §550.1205(b) based on the rate of pay in effect at the time the annual leave became subject to for-feiture under 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), or (c). (h) An agency may not make a lump- sum payment for accumulated or ac-crued annual leave to—(1) An employee who transfers between positions cov-ered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code; (2) An employee who transfers to a position not covered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, but to which all of his or her ac-cumulated and accrued annual leave may be transferred; (3) An employee who transfers to the government of the District of Columbia or the U.S. Postal Service; (4) A nonappropriated fund employee of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard who moves without a break in service of more than 3 days to an appropriated fund position within the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, under 5 U.S.C. 6308(b); or (5) An employee who is concurrently employed in more than one part-time position and who separates from one of the part-time positions.

Non-occupational/Patient Record means a record of treatment or exam-ination, created and maintained by a health care facility, when the person is admitted to or voluntarily seeks treat-ment at the health care facility for non-job-related reasons. Records main-tained by an agency dispensary are pa-tient records for the purposes of these regulations except when such records result as a condition of employment or relate to an on-the-job occurrence.

It touches on an important procedural issue that HR professionals, records managers, and legal staff in federal agencies frequently encounter. The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of information management and administrative protocols.

The practicality is strong because FOIA requests are common, and understanding the proper handling of requests for non-existent records is crucial for maintaining transparency and legal compliance. This question would be particularly useful for:
1. HR specialists managing records and FOIA requests
2. Federal agency administrators
3. Legal professionals working in federal agencies
4. Researchers interested in government information access procedures

While not a high-stakes policy question, it addresses a specific procedural challenge that requires precise knowledge of administrative protocols. The question shows a sophisticated approach to understanding federal information management, making it valuable for professionals working within or studying federal administrative processes."

The Office of Personnel Management bases its procedures for handling na-tional security information on Execu-tive Order 12065, ‘‘National Security In-formation,’’ and Information Security Oversight Office Directive No. 1 con-cerning national security information. [45 FR 995, Jan. 4, 1980] § 175.102 Requests for the declassifica- tion of documents. Any Federal agency, Government employee or member of the public has the right to request a mandatory re-view of any classified document, held by the Office of Personnel Manage-ment, which was classified for national security purposes by the Civil Service Commission. The Office of Personnel Management does not have the author-ity to classify documents. (a) Requests for mandatory declas- sification review should be addressed to the Director, Office of Management, or the designee of the Director, who will act on requests within 60 days. Re-quests need not be made in any special form but shall, as specified in section 3–501 of the Executive order, reason-ably describe the information. (b) Based upon the review, the docu- ment, or any reasonably segregable portion thereof that no longer requires protection under the Executive order, shall be declassified and released un- less withholding is otherwise war-ranted under applicable law. (c) No OPM official will refuse to confirm the existence or non-existence of any document requested under the Freedom of Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of the Ex-ecutive order, unless the fact of its ex-istence or', 'by the President or OPM, list positions to the appropriate schedule of the excepted service only after obtaining written ap-proval from the OPM Director to do so. For exceptions effectuated by Con-gress, inform OPM of the positions ex-cepted either before the effective date of the provision, if the statutory provi-sions are not immediately effective, or within 30 days thereafter. (6) For exceptions created by the President or OPM, initiate any hiring actions under the excepted service au-thority only after OPM publishes any such authorizations in the F EDERAL REGISTER , to include the types, num- bers, and locations of the positions moved to the excepted service. (c) In accordance with the require- ments provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section— (1) An agency that seeks to move an encumbered position from the competi-tive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, must— (i) Provide written notification to the incumbent employee of the intent to move the position 30 days prior to the effective date of the position being moved. (ii) In the written notification re- quired by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this sec-tion, if the movement was involuntary, inform the employee that the employee retains any competitive status or pro-cedural and appeal rights previously accrued under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, notwithstanding the movement of the position, and inform the employee of appeal rights conferred under §302.603 and the timing for exer-cising such appeal rights.

(a) A competitive service employee whose position is placed into the ex-cepted service or who is otherwise moved involuntarily to the excepted service, or an excepted service em-ployee whose position is placed into a different schedule of the excepted serv-ice or who is otherwise involuntarily moved to a position in a different schedule of the excepted service, may directly appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, as provided in para-graphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The appeal rights conferred in this sec-tion are in addition to, and not in dero-gation of, any right the individual would otherwise have to appeal a sub-sequent personnel action undertaken without following appropriate proce-dures under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code. (b) Where the agency, notwith- standing the requirements of section 302.602 of this part, asserts that the move of the original position or any subsequent position to which the indi-vidual is involuntarily moved there-after will eliminate competitive status or any procedural and appeal rights that had previously accrued, the af-fected individual may appeal from that determination and request an order di-recting the agency: (1) To correct the notice to provide that any previously accrued status or procedural and appeal rights under those provisions continue to apply; and (2) To comply with the requirements of either chapter 75, subchapter II or section 4303, title 5, United States Code, in pursuing any action available under those provisions, except to the extent that any such order would be in-consistent with an applicable statute. (c) Where the agency fails to comply with §302.602(c)(1) of this part and fails to provide the individual with the req-uisite notice, the affected individual may appeal the failure to provide the requisite notice and request an order directing the agency to comply with that provision. (d) An individual may appeal under this part on the basis that: (1) A facially voluntary move was co- erced or otherwise involuntary; or (2) A facially voluntary move to a new position would require the indi-vidual to relinquish their competitive status or any civil service protections and the move was coerced or otherwise involuntary.

(c) A consultant position is one that requires providing advice, views, opin-ions, alternatives, or recommendations on a temporary and/or intermittent basis on issues, problems, or questions presented by a Federal official. (d) An expert is a person who is spe- cially qualified by education and expe-rience to perform difficult and chal-lenging tasks in a particular field be-yond the usual range of achievement of competent persons in that field. An ex-pert is regarded by other persons in the field as an authority or practitioner of unusual competence and skill in a pro-fessional, scientific, technical or other activity. (e) An expert position is one that re- quires the services of a specialist with skills superior to those of others in the same profession, occupation, or activ-ity to perform work on a temporary and/or intermittent basis assigned by a Federal official. For example, a micro-bial contamination specialist may apply new test methods to', 'may not change the initial summary rating but may recommend a different rating to the PRB. HLR may be pro-vided by an official who is at a higher level in the agency than the appointing authority who will approve the final rating under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (ii) When an agency cannot provide review by a higher-level official for an executive who receives an initial sum-mary rating from the agency head be-cause no such official exists in the agency, the agency must offer an alter-native review as it determines appro-priate, except that the review may not be provided by a member of the PRB or an official who participated in deter-mining the initial summary rating. (iii) If a senior executive declines re- view by agency-designated higher-level officials, the agency may offer an al-ternative review but it not obligated to do so. The agency must document the executive’s declination of the HLR op-portunity provided by the agency be-fore offering an alternative review. (iv) Copies of findings and rec- ommendations of the HLR official or the official performing an alternative review under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) through (iii) of this section must be given to the senior executive, the su-pervisor, and the PRB. (3) PRB review. The PRB must receive and review the initial summary rating, the senior executive’s response to the initial rating if made, and findings and recommendations of any HLR or any alternative review under paragraph (e)(2) of this section before making rec-ommendations to the appointing au-thority, as provided in §430.311.

(5) Shortened appraisal periods. The procedures of this section apply when-ever an agency terminates an appraisal period under §430.304(b)(5). § 430.310 Details and job changes. (a) When a senior executive is de- tailed or temporarily reassigned for 120 days or longer, the gaining organiza-tion must set performance goals and requirements for the detail or tem-porary assignment. The gaining organi-zation must appraise the senior execu-tive’s performance in writing, includ-ing through the use of automated sys-tems, and this appraisal must be con-sidered when deriving the initial sum-mary rating. (b) When a senior executive is reas- signed or transferred to another agency after completing the minimum ap-praisal period, the supervisor must ap-praise the executive’s performance in writing, including through the use of automated systems, before the execu-tive leaves and provide this informa-tion to the executive. (c) The most recent annual summary rating and any subsequent appraisals must be transferred to the gaining agency or organization. The gaining supervisor must consider the rating and appraisals when deriving the ini-tial summary rating at the end of the appraisal period. § 430.311 Performance Review Boards (PRBs). Each agency must establish one or more PRBs to make recommendations to the appointing authority on the per-formance of its senior executives. (a) Membership. (1) Each PRB must have three or more members who are appointed by the agency head, or by another official or group acting on be-half of the agency head. Agency heads are encouraged to consider diversity and inclusion in establishing their PRBs. (2) PRB members must be appointed in a way that assures consistency, sta-bility, and objectivity in SES perform-ance appraisal. (3) When appraising a career ap- pointee’s performance or recom-mending a career appointee for a per-formance-based pay adjustment or per-formance award, more than one-half of the PRB’s members must be SES ca-reer appointees. (4) The agency must publish notice of PRB appointments in the F EDERAL REGISTER before service begins. (b) Functions. (1) Each PRB must con- sider agency performance as commu-nicated by the oversight official through the performance appraisal guidelines when reviewing and evalu-ating the initial summary rating, any senior executive’s response, and any higher-level official’s findings and rec-ommendations on the initial summary rating or the results of an alternative review. The PRB may conduct any fur-ther review needed to make its rec-ommendations. The PRB may not re-view an initial summary rating to which the executive has not been given the opportunity to respond in writing, including through the use of auto-mated systems. (2) The PRB must make a written recommendation, including through the use of automated systems, to the appointing authority about each senior executive’s annual summary rating, performance-based pay adjustment, and performance award. (3) PRB members may not take part in any PRB deliberations involving their own appraisals, performance- based pay adjustments, and perform-ance awards. § 430.312 Using performance results. (a) Agencies must use performance appraisals as a basis for adjusting pay, granting awards, retaining senior ex-ecutives, and making other personnel decisions. Performance appraisals also will be a factor in assessing a senior ex-ecutive’s continuing development needs. (b) Agencies are required to provide appropriate incentives and recognition (including pay adjustments and per-formance awards under part 534, sub-part D) for excellence in performance. (c) A career executive may be re- moved from the SES for performance reasons, subject to the provisions of part 359, subpart E, as follows: VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00377 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR368 5 CFR Ch.

(a) To assure effective implementa- tion of agency performance manage-ment systems, agencies must provide appropriate information and training to agency leadership, supervisors, and senior executives on performance man-agement, including planning and ap-praising performance. (b) Agencies must periodically evalu- ate the effectiveness of their perform-ance management system(s) and imple-ment improvements as needed. Evalua-tions must provide for both assessment of effectiveness and compliance with relevant laws, OPM regulations, and OPM performance management policy. (c) Agencies must maintain all per- formance-related records for no fewer than 5 years from the date the annual summary rating is issued, as required in 5 CFR', 'the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additional information needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. OPM will also offer the record seeker an op-portunity to confer, with the objective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirements of this section. (d) Medical records. OPM or another Government agency may disclose the medical records of an applicant, em-ployee, or annuitant to the subject of the record, or to a representative des-ignated in writing. However, medical records may contain information about an individual’s mental or physical con-dition that a prudent physician would hesitate to give to the individual. Under such circumstances, OPM may disclose the records, including the exact nature and probable outcome of the condition, only to a licensed physi-cian designated in writing for that pur-pose by the individual or his or her des-ignated representative. (e) Publications. If the subject matter of a request includes material pub-lished and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents, Govern-ment Printing Office), OPM will ex-plain where a person may review and/or purchase the publications. (f) Responses within 10 working days. Except in unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)), OPM will determine whether to disclose or deny records within 10 working days after receipt of the request (excluding weekends and holidays) and will pro-vide notice immediately of its deter- mination and the reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal any adverse de-termination.

(a) Applicability of fees. (1) OPM will furnish, without charge, reasonable quantities of material that it has avail-able for free distribution to the public. (2) OPM may furnish other materials, subject to payment of fees intended to recoup the full allowable direct costs of providing services. Fees for these ma-terials may be waived if the request meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section. (3) If a request does not include an acceptable agreement to pay fees and does not otherwise convey a willing-ness to pay fees, OPM will promptly provide notification of the estimated fees. This notice will offer an oppor-tunity to confer with OPM staff to re-formulate the request to meet the re-quester’s needs at a lower cost. Upon agreement to pay the required fees, OPM will further process the request. (4) As described in §294.107, OPM ordi- narily responds to FOIA requests in a decentralized manner. Because of this, OPM may at times refer a single re-quest to two or more OPM entities to make separate direct responses. In such cases, each responding entity may assess fees as provided by this section, but only for direct costs associated with any response it has prepared. (5) If fees for document search are au- thorized as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, OPM may assess charges for employee time spent searching for documents and other direct costs of a search, even if a search fails to locate records or if records located are deter-mined to be exempt from disclosure. Searches should be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive man- ner so as to minimize the cost for both the agency and the requester, e.g., per-sonnel should not engage in line-by- line search when photocopying an en-tire document would be a less expen-sive and quicker way to comply with a request. (6) Services requested and performed but not required under the FOIA, such as formal certification of records as true copies, will be subject to charges under the Federal User Charge Statute (31 U.S.C. 483a) or other applicable statutes. (b) Rates used to compute fees. The fol- lowing rates form the basis for assess-ing reasonable, standard charges for document search, duplication, and re-view as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The listing of rates below should be used in conjunction with the fee com-ponents listed in paragraph (c) of this section: Service Rate Employee time .......................

Actual direct cost. Supplies and other materials Actual direct cost. Other costs not identified above.Actual direct cost. (c) Assessing fees based on requester’s category. Rates are assessed differently for the different categories of request-ers as defined in §294.103. Requests have three cost components for the purpose of assessing fees: the cost of document search, the cost of duplica-tion, and the cost of review. OPM will apply the rates in paragraph (b) of this section to the cost components that apply to the requester’s category as follows: Requester’s category Search Review Duplication Commercial ..............................

If requested records are maintained in a computerized data base, OPM will use the following formula, suggested by OMB, to provide the equivalent of 2 hours manual search time free before charging for com-puter search time: The operator’s hourly salary plus 16% will be added to the hourly cost of operating the central processing u nit that contains the record information.

(2) If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more than $25, OPM will not release the records unless the requester agrees in advance to pay the anticipated charges. (3) OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when there is a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests to evade the assessment of fees.

The question targets a critical procedural detail that is extremely relevant for both HR specialists and SES employees. Understanding how non-pay status time is credited during the probationary period is crucial for career progression, performance evaluation, and potential retention or removal decisions. 

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of SES employment policies, focusing on a technical but important regulatory consideration. It would be particularly useful for:
1. HR professionals managing SES probationary periods
2. SES employees seeking to understand their employment status
3. Managers involved in SES performance evaluations
4. Legal and compliance professionals interpreting employment regulations

The specificity of the question suggests a genuine need for precise information about how non-pay status impacts the critical probationary period for senior executives. This type of detailed inquiry helps ensure accurate interpretation and application of federal employment regulations, making it highly valuable for stakeholders involved in federal executive management."
" Can an employee be disqualified from a position solely based on their medical history?
"," No. According to §339.206, an employee or applicant may not be disqualified for any position solely on the basis of medical history. For positions subject to medical standards or physical requirements, a medical condition may only result in disqualification if: 1) the condition itself is disqualifying, 2) recurrence of the condition is based on reasonable medical judgment, and 3) the duties of the position are such that a recurrence would pose a significant risk of substantial harm.","['certain hazardous mate-rials.

Practitioner means a person providing health services who is not a medical doctor, but who is certified by a na-tional organization, licensed by a State, and/or registered as a health professional to provide the health serv-ice in question. Subtle incapacitation means gradual, initially imperceptible impairment of physical or mental function, whether reversible or not, which is likely to re-sult in safety, performance and/or con-duct issues that may undermine the agency’s commitment to maintaining a safe working environment for all em-ployees and others. Sudden incapacitation means abrupt onset of loss of control of physical or mental function(s), whether reversible or not, which is likely to result in safe-ty, performance or conduct issues that may undermine the agency’s commit-ment to maintaining a safe working environment for all employees and oth-ers.

OPM must review and decide upon an agency’s request to pass over a can-didate, who is a preference eligible, on medical grounds pursuant to §339.306. OPM may deny an applicant employ-ment by reason of physical or mental unfitness for the position for which he or she has applied.

OPM may establish and/or approve medical standards for a Government-wide occupation ( i.e., an occupation common to more than one agency) or approve revisions to its established medical standards. An individual agen- cy may establish medical standards for positions that predominate in that agency ( i.e., where the agency has 50 percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be justified on the basis that the duties of the positions are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status for successful perform-ance when the nature of the positions involves a high degree of responsibility toward the public or sensitive national security concerns. The rationale for es-tablishing the standard must be docu-mented and supported by a study(ies) or evaluation(s) establishing the med-ical standard is job-related to the occu-pation(s). Medical standards estab-lished by agencies must be approved by OPM prior to implementation.

Additional information obtained by the agency may be considered in deter-mining whether a waiver is appro-priate. An agency may establish time-frames, in writing, for submission of initial or additional information for consideration, with allowance for rea-sonable extensions. (b) Agencies may, but are not re- quired to, establish medical review boards to help the agency provide a case-by-case, fact-based, individualized assessment whenever an individual is found to not meet agency medical standards or physical requirements. An agency may also use a medical review board as a forum for a higher level of review within the agency when medical questions or issues arise. If established, the Board is expected to recommend administrative actions that are con-sistent with applicable law, as well as applicable and current medical prac-tice standards of care, through the combined expertise of its members. (c) The use and composition of a med- ical review board will be determined by the agency. Upon request, an agency will provide to OPM information re-garding the composition and use of medical review boards. OPM may issue guidance from time to time as to best practices with respect to the composi-tion and use of such boards. § 339.205 Medical evaluation programs. Agencies may establish periodic med- ical examinations, medical surveil-lance, or immunization programs by written policies or directives to safe-guard the health of employees whose work may expose them or others to sig-nificant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental expo-sure or demands. This may include the requirement to undergo vaccination with products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (e.g., for na-tional security reasons or in order to fulfill the duties of a position des-ignated as national security sensitive). The need for a medical evaluation pro-gram must be clearly supported by the nature of the work. The specific posi-tions covered must be identified and the applicants or employees notified in writing of the reasons for including the positions in the program. § 339.206 Disqualification on the basis of medical history. An employee or applicant may not be disqualified for any position solely on the basis of medical history. For posi-tions subject to medical standards and/ or physical requirements, and for posi-tions under medical evaluation pro-grams, a history of a particular med-ical condition may result in medical disqualification only if the condition at issue is itself disqualifying, recur-rence of the condition is based on rea-sonable medical judgment, and the du-ties of the position are such that a re-currence of the condition would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to', 'vised.........................................60329 335 Authority citation revised ......84690 335.107 Added;

Under 5 U.S.C. 5363, an employee whose rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced as a result of a man-agement action is entitled to retain his or her rate of basic pay under the cir-cumstances prescribed in this part. § 536.102 Coverage. (a) Subject to the exclusions in para- graphs (b) through (e) of this section, this part covers any employee who, at the time this part is applied— (1) Is in a covered pay system; or (2) Is moving to a position under a covered pay system from a position not under a covered pay system, as long as the individual was an employee as de- fined in 5 CFR 536.103 while serving in the position in a noncovered pay sys-tem. (b) An agency may not provide grade or pay retention under this part to an employee who— (1) Is reduced in grade or pay for per- sonal cause or at the employee’s re-quest; (2) Was employed on a temporary or term basis immediately before the ac-tion causing the reduction in grade or pay; (3) Does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2), and, as a result, is re-moved from a supervisory or manage-rial position; (4) Is entitled to receive a saved rate of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 3594(c) and 5 CFR 359.705 because of removal from the Senior Executive Service and placement in a civil service position (other than a Senior Executive Service position) under 5 U.S.C. 3594(b)(2); (5) Moves from an Executive Sched- ule position paid under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter II, or a position whose rate of pay is fixed by law at a rate equal to a rate for the Executive Schedule; (6) Moves between positions not under a covered pay system or from a position under a covered pay system to a position not under a covered pay sys- tem; (7) Moves to a nonappropriated fund position as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c) (except a position occupied by a pre-vailing rate employee); (8) Moves from a nonappropriated fund position as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c) (except a position occupied by a prevailing rate employee) to a position in a covered pay system, unless covered by §536.302(a); or (9) Is reduced in pay upon termi- nation of a critical position pay au-thority under 5 CFR part 535. (c) An agency may not provide grade or pay retention under this part based on the grade or rate of basic pay held by the employee during a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment. However, a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment does not af-fect an employee’s preexisting entitle-ment to grade or pay retention. (d) An agency may not provide grade retention under subpart B of this part to an employee who moves from a posi-tion not under a covered pay system to a position under a covered pay system. (e) An employee loses eligibility for or entitlement to grade or pay reten-tion under the conditions specified in §§536.207, 536.208, and 536.308.

A rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the applicable rate of basic pay is con- sidered to be any rate of basic pay that exceeds the amount derived by multi-plying the applicable rate of basic pay by a factor of 1.1; (3) Any pay-setting action under §534.506(c)(2) that results in a higher rate of basic pay than the senior pro-fessional had upon leaving the agency; and (4) Any off-cycle pay increase under §534.510. (d) An agency must keep its written procedures for setting and increasing rates of basic pay up to date, make them available to affected SL and ST employees, periodically provide train-ing or supplemental guidance to clarify how they are applied, and provide a copy to OPM upon request. (e)(1) The head of an agency may del- egate to an Inspector General the au-thority to set and adjust pay for senior professionals in the Office of the In-spector General, including authority for pay actions described in paragraph (c) of this section. (2) An agency head who delegates to an Inspector General the authority to set and adjust pay for all senior profes-sionals in the Office of the Inspector General, including all pay actions de-scribed in paragraph (c) of this section, may exclude those senior professionals from the count of agency senior profes-sionals for the purpose of determining whether centralized review under para-graph (a)(5) of this section is required.

[79 FR 12357, Mar. 5, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 57698, Sept. 25, 2015] § 534.506 Setting a rate of basic pay upon appointment. (a) An authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of an indi-vidual who is not currently an SL or ST appointee of the agency at any rate within the applicable rate range under §534.504(a) upon appointment to an SL or ST position in the agency, subject to the requirements of this section. In setting a new senior professional’s rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individ-ual’s experience, accomplishments, and any unique skills, qualifications, or competencies the individual possesses as they relate to requirements of the senior professional position and its im-pact on the agency’s performance. When making a first appointment (re-gardless of tenure) as a civilian em-ployee of the Federal Government, an agency may not consider the individ-ual’s salary history ( i.e., existing sal- ary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer. Rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Exec-utive Schedule, but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, generally are reserved for those newly appointed senior profes-sionals who possess superior leader-ship, scientific, professional or other competencies necessary to address key program and mission requirements, as determined by the agency through its strategic human capital planning proc-ess. (b) Consistent with the agency’s writ- ten procedures and paragraph (a) of this section, an authorized agency offi-cial may set the rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee upon transfer from another agency at any rate of basic pay within the pay range that ap-plies to the SL or ST position under §534.504(a), except as provided in §534.509(a). (c)(1) Consistent with the agency’s written procedures and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an au-thorized agency official may set pay upon reappointment of a former SL or ST employee at any rate of basic pay within the pay range that applies to the SL or ST position under §534.504(a). When setting pay, the agency may not consider the individual’s non-Federal salary history ( i.e., existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a com-peting job offer. (2) If a former agency SL or ST em- ployee is reappointed within 30 days to the same position or a successor posi-tion in the same agency, the agency may not give the individual a higher rate of basic pay upon reappointment unless the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications de-scribed in §430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior profes-sionals in the agency determines that a higher rate of basic pay is warranted.

An agency may not further extend a period of in-vestigative leave under paragraph (g) of this section on or after the date that is 30 calendar days after the comple-tion of the investigation of the em-ployee by an investigative entity. (i) Possible prohibited personnel action. For purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapter II, and section 1221, place-ment on investigative leave under this subpart for a period of 70 workdays or more shall be considered a personnel action for purposes of the Office of Spe-cial Counsel in applying the prohibited personnel practices provisions at 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8) or (9). (j) Conversion of workdays to hours. In applying this section, the limitations based on workdays ( i.e., the 30-workday increments in paragraphs (b), (f), and (g) of this section and the 70-workday limit in paragraph (i) of this section) must be converted to hours, taking into account the different workdays that can apply to employees under dif-ferent work schedules, as follows: (1) For a full-time employee (includ- ing an employee on a regular 40-hour basic workweek or a flexible or com-pressed work schedule under 5 U.S.C. chapter 61, subchapter II, but excluding an employee on an uncommon tour of duty), the 30-workday increment is converted to 240 hours and the 70-work-day limit is converted to 560 hours. (2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty under §630.210, the 30-workday increment is converted to three times the number of hours in the biweekly uncommon tour of duty (or the average biweekly hours for un-common tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle), and the 70-workday limit is converted to a number of hours derived by multi-plying the hours equivalent of 30 work-days (for a given uncommon tour) times the ratio of 70 divided by 30. (3) For a part-time employee, the cal- endar year limit is prorated based on the number of hours in the officially scheduled part-time tour of duty estab-lished for purposes of charging leave when absent ( e.g., for a part-time em- ployee who has an officially scheduled half-time tour of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the 30-workday increment is converted to 120 hours, which is half of 240 hours (the 30-workday increment for full-time employees)). (4) For an employee who has more than one type of work schedule while on investigative leave, the 30-workday and 70-workday limits must be applied by— (i) Converting hours of investigative leave used under a part-time schedule by multiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the officially scheduled biweekly part- time tour of duty established for pur-poses of charging leave when absent; (ii) Converting hours of investigative leave used under a biweekly uncommon tour of duty under §630.210 (or the aver-age biweekly hours for uncommon tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle) by mul-tiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the uncommon tour of duty; (iii) Summing the hours of investiga- tive leave used for each period of time under a different type of work sched-ule, using actual hours for full-time tours and converted hours for part- time and uncommon tours, as deter-mined under paragraphs (j)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section; and VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00920 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR911 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1506 (iv) Applying the sum derived under paragraph (j)(4)(iii) of this section against a 240-hour standard for pur-poses of the 30-workday limit and against a 560-hour standard for the pur-poses of the 70-workday limit. § 630.1505 Administration of notice leave. (a) Commencement. Notice leave may commence only after an employee has received written notice of a proposed adverse action. There is no require-ment that the employee exhaust 10 workdays of administrative leave under 5 U.S.C. 6329a(b) and §630.1404 be-fore the employee may be placed on no-tice leave. (b) Duration. Placement of an em- ployee on notice leave shall be for a pe-riod not longer than the duration of the notice period. (c) Written explanation of leave. If an agency places an employee on notice leave, the agency must provide the em-ployee with a written explanation re-garding the placement of the employee on notice leave.

It touches on critical areas of Title 5 regulations related to employment discrimination, medical privacy, and fair hiring practices. The question is practical and addresses a genuine concern for both job applicants and HR professionals who must navigate complex legal and ethical guidelines surrounding medical information in hiring decisions.

The query is particularly valuable because it explores the intersection of medical history, employment eligibility, and potential discrimination protections. It requires a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations, including aspects of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other protections outlined in Title 5. HR specialists, managers involved in hiring, and job applicants would find this question extremely useful in understanding the legal boundaries of medical information in employment decisions.

While not receiving a perfect 5 rating, the question is nonetheless highly practical and addresses a significant concern in federal employment contexts. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to understanding the limits of medical information use in hiring processes, which is crucial for ensuring fair and legal employment practices."
" How do Senior Executive Service (SES) employees accrue annual leave, and what is the maximum amount they can accumulate?
"," According to § 630.301, SES employees accrue annual leave at a rate of 1 day (8 hours) for each full biweekly pay period. They can accumulate up to 90 days (720 hours) of annual leave at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period in a calendar year. Additionally, an SES employee who had accumulated more than 90 days of annual leave as of October 13, 1994, is entitled to retain that leave as a personal leave ceiling.","['of this section, the employing agency may approve the use of any or all annual leave donated to an employee under part 630, subpart I, of this chapter (Voluntary Leave Transfer Program), or made available to the employee under part 630, subpart J, of this chapter (Voluntary Leave Bank Program), as of the effective date of the reduction in force or relocation.

(b) Overtime thresholds for standard tours. (1) The applicable biweekly over- time threshold prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies during a pay period to an agent whose regular tour of duty is fixed at one of the three standard tours for the entire pay pe-riod. (2) For an agent covered by para-graph (b)(1) of this section, the thresh-old used to determine whether an agent has performed overtime work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is— (i) 100 hours for a Level 1 regular tour of duty; (ii) 90 hours for a Level 2 regular tour of duty; or (iii) 80 hours for a Basic regular tour of duty. (c) Overtime threshold for hybrid pay period. (1) For a hybrid pay period in which an agent has one type of regular tour of duty in effect for one part of the period and another type for an-other part of the period, the threshold used to determine whether an agent has performed overtime work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is equal to the sum of the reg-ular time hours (paid or unpaid) and the number of normally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty (whether obligated or not and whether worked or not) in the pay pe-riod. For example, if an agent has a Level 1 regular tour of duty in the first week of a pay period and a Level 2 reg-ular tour of duty in the second week, the agent’s regular time hours would be 40 in the first week and 40 in the sec-ond week and the normally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty would be 10 (5 days times 2 hours each day) in the first week and 5 (5 days times 1 hour each day) in second week, resulting in an biweekly over-time threshold of 95 hours. (2) For a hybrid pay period in which an individual is employed as a Border Patrol agent for only part of the pay period, the threshold used to determine whether an agent has performed over-time work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is equal to the sum of the paid regular time hours (paid or unpaid) and the number of nor-mally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty (whether obli-gated or not and whether worked or not) during the portion of the pay pe-riod the individual was employed as an agent. For example, if an individual is employed as an agent only during the second week of a pay period and has a Level 1 regular tour of duty, the over-time threshold would be 50 hours (40 regular time hours plus 10 normally scheduled overtime hours) in deter-mining whether the agent has overtime hours in that week that are compen-sable under §§550.1624, 550.1625, and 550.1626.

(a) Coverage. An agent is entitled to compensatory time off as provided in this section for irregular overtime hours outside an agent’s regular tour of duty, as specified in §550.1623, except that such hours are excluded from cov-erage under this section (except para-graph (c) of this section) when required by the superseding provisions in §550.1626.

Notwith- standing paragraph (b) of this section, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5542(b)(1) and §550.112(h), an agent must be deemed to have performed 2 hours of irregular overtime work for a lesser amount of irregular overtime work if— (1) An agent is required perform such work on a day when the agent was not scheduled to work; or', 'the same purpose is entitled to overtime pay in accordance with the provisions of section 5544 of title 5, United States Code. The rate of pay for each hour of overtime work of such an employee is computed as fol- lows: (1) If the rate of basic pay of the em- ployee is fixed on an annual basis, di-vide the rate of basic pay by 2,087 and multiply the quotient by one and one- half; and (2) If the rate of basic pay of the em- ployee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply the rate of basic pay by 12 to derive an annual rate of basic pay, di-vide the annual rate of basic pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half. Rates are computed in full cents, counting a fraction of a cent as the next higher cent. (e)(1) For firefighters compensated under subpart M of this part, the over-time hourly rate for all overtime hours is 1 1⁄2times the firefighter’s hourly rate of basic pay under §550.1303(a) or (b)(2), as applicable, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (2) For firefighters compensated under subpart M of this part who areexempt from the overtime provi-sions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and whose hourly rate of basic pay under §550.1303(a) or (b)(2), as applica-ble, exceeds the applicable minimum hourly rate of basic pay for GS–10 (as computed under paragraph (a) of this section by dividing the annual rate of basic pay by 2087 hours), the overtime hourly rate is equal to the greater of— (i) One and one-half times the appli- cable minimum hourly rate of basic pay for GS–10 (as computed under para-graph (a) of this section by dividing the annual rate of basic pay by 2087 hours); or (ii) The individual’s own firefighter hourly rate of basic pay under §550.1303(a) and (b)(2), as applicable.

The question is practical and valuable for multiple stakeholders:

1. For HR Specialists: It provides critical information about leave accrual and maximum accumulation rules specific to SES employees, which is essential for accurate benefits administration.

2. For SES Employees: Understanding their leave accrual and maximum accumulation helps with personal planning, career management, and financial considerations related to potential leave payouts.

3. For Managers: Knowing the leave rules for SES employees is important for workforce management and understanding compensation structures.

The question targets a nuanced area of federal employment regulations that is not immediately obvious to most people. It requires specific knowledge of Title 5 provisions related to executive service leave policies. The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for precise information about a complex employment benefit.

The query is particularly useful because SES employees have different leave accrual rules compared to other federal employees, making this information both specialized and important for accurate understanding of federal employment benefits."
 What are the key purposes of research programs in personnel management according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)?," According to § 470.201, research programs aim to: (1) Develop new knowledge, techniques, and materials about personnel management; (2) Seek solutions to personnel management problems; (3) Provide a factual base to support existing or proposed changes in personnel management policies; (4) Modify or develop personnel management systems to improve federal human resource management; (5) Gather and systematize knowledge from practicing managers; (6) Develop new research methods or standards; and (7) Design systems for assessing and transmitting personnel management strategies.","['Personnel Management, or under its supervision, to determine whether a specified change in personnel management poli-cies or procedures would result in im-proved Federal personnel management (5 U.S.C. 4701).

(c) Factors for authorizing a retention incentive for a group or category of em-ployees. (1) An agency must consider the factors in paragraph (b) of this sec-tion as they relate to determining whether a group or category of employ-ees— (i) Has unusually high or unique qualifications ( i.e., competencies) or that the agency has a special need for the employees’ services that makes it essential to retain the employees in that category; and (ii) That it is reasonable to presume that there is a high risk that a signifi-cant number of employees in the tar-geted category would be likely to leave the Federal service in the absence of a retention incentive. (2) An agency must narrowly define a targeted category of employees using factors that relate to the conditions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Factors that may be appro-priate include the following: occupa-tional series, grade level, distinctive job duties, unique competencies re-quired for the position, assignment to a special project, minimum agency serv-ice requirements, organization or team designation, geographic location, and required rating of record. (While a rat-ing of record of higher than the ‘‘Fully Successful’’ rating of record required by §575.305(d) may be a factor used in defining the targeted category, a rat-ing of record by itself is not sufficient to justify a', 'record (e.g., 5 CFR 531.206 for GS positions and 5 CFR 532.413 for Federal Wage System posi-tions).

The determination to sus-pend implementation may be made by the Director or the Director’s designee. Suspending the implementation does not change the effective date of the de-cision except when the original deci-sion requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the em-ployee is not entitled to grade or pay retention. (c) When the original decision re- quires that the grade or pay of the po-sition be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay retention, the reviewing authority, if sustaining the original decision, shall issue a new certificate and the effective date of the new certificate shall be not earlier than the date of the new decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the new decision, unless a subsequent VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00403 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR394 5 CFR Ch.

(a) Applicability. A retroactive effec- tive date may be required only if the employee is wrongfully demoted. (b) Downgrading. (1) The effective date of a classification appellate cer-tificate or agency appellate decision can be retroactive only if it corrects a classification action which resulted in a loss of grade or pay. In order for the decision to be made retroactive, the employee must file the initial request for review with either the agency or the Office not later than 15 calendar days after the effective date of the re-classification action. (2) However, if the appellate decision raises the grade of the position above the original grade, retroactivity will apply only to the extent of restoration to the original grade. (3) The right to a retroactive effec- tive date provided by this section is preserved on subsequent appeals from an agency or Office classification deci-sion when the subsequent appeal is filed not later than 15 calendar days following receipt of written notifica-tion of a final agency administrative decision or 15 calendar days after the effective date of the action taken as a result of the classification decision, whichever is later. (c) Grade change based on new duties and responsibilities. Retroactivity may be based only on duties and responsibil-ities existing at the time of demotion and cannot be based on duties and re-sponsibilities assigned later. (d) Retroactivity when time limits are extended. The right to a retroactive ef- fective date provided by this section may be preserved at the discretion of the Office, on a showing by the em-ployee that he or she was not notified of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that cir-cumstances beyond his or her control prevented filing an appeal within the prescribed time limit.

A national emergency must meet all of the following condi- tions: (i) It was declared by the President or Congress. (ii) It involves a danger to the United States’ safety, security, or stability that results from specified cir-cumstances or conditions and that is national in scope. (iii) It requires a national program specifically intended to combat the threat to national safety, security, or stability. (2) Termination of a national emer- gency. A national emergency no longer exists if it is officially terminated by the President or Congress, or if the spe- cific circumstances, conditions, or pro- gram cited in the original declaration are terminated or corrected. (b) Basic authority. Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appoint-ments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM’s approval to make emergency-indefinite appoint-ments without a declared national emergency when the President has au-thorized the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must make emergency-indefi-nite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available eligibles. (c) Appointment under direct-hire au- thority. An agency may make emer- gency-indefinite appointments under this section using the direct-hire proce-dures in part 337 of this chapter. (d) Appointment noncompetitively. An agency may give emergency-indefinite appointments under this section to the following classes of persons without re-gard to registers of eligibles and the provisions in §332.102 of this chapter: (1) Persons who were recruited on a standby basis prior to the national emergency; (2) Members of the National Defense Executive Reserve, designated in ac-cordance with section 710(e) of the De-fense Production Act of 1950, Executive Order 11179 of September 22, 1964, and applications issued by the agency au-thorized to implement the law and Ex-ecutive Order; and (3) Former Federal employees eligi- ble for reinstatement. (e) Tenure of emergency-indefinite em- ployees. (1) Emergency-indefinite em- ployees do not acquire a competitive status on the basis of their emergency- indefinite appointments. (2) An emergency-indefinite appoint- ment may be continued for the dura-tion of the emergency for which it is made. (f) Trial period. (1) The first year of service of an emergency-indefinite em-ployee is a trial period. (2) The agency may terminate the ap- pointment of an emergency-indefinite employee at any time during the trial period. The employee is entitled to the procedures set forth in §315.804 or §315.805 of this chapter as appropriate. (g) Eligibility for within-grade in- creases. An emergency-indefinite em- ployee serving in a position subject to the General Schedule is eligible for within-grade increases in accordance with subpart D of part 531 of this chap-ter. (h) Applications of other regulations. (1) The term indefinite employee includes an emergency-indefinite employee or an employee under an emergency ap-pointment as used in the following: parts 351, 353 of this chapter, subpart G of part 550 of this chapter, and part 752 of this chapter. (2) The selection procedures of part 337 of this chapter apply to emergency- indefinite appointments that use the direct-hire authority under paragraph (c) of this section. (3) Despite the provisions in §831.201(a)(11) of this chapter, an em-ployee serving under an emergency-in-definite appointment under authority of this section is excluded from retire-ment coverage, except as provided in paragraph (b) of §831.201 of this chap-ter.

While it relates to personnel management and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which are directly connected to Title 5 regulations, the question is somewhat abstract and academic in nature. 

The question's relevance is mixed:
- It touches on an important federal agency (OPM) responsible for personnel policies
- Research programs in personnel management can inform policy development and workforce strategies
- However, the question is more theoretical and less immediately practical for day-to-day federal employment concerns

Potential value exists for:
- HR researchers and policy analysts
- OPM staff and policy developers
- Academic researchers studying federal workforce management
- Senior HR specialists interested in strategic personnel management

Limitations include:
- Not directly addressing specific employee rights, benefits, or procedures
- Lacks immediate actionable insights for most federal employees
- Requires a more specialized, research-oriented perspective

The question would be more compelling if it specified the practical implications or specific outcomes of OPM's research programs. As it stands, it provides a general inquiry into OPM's research purposes without clear practical context."

Candidates may be advanced without time restriction to positions up to GS– 5 if the position to be filled is no more than two grades above the lowest grade the employee held within the preceding 52 weeks under his or her latest non-temporary competitive appointment. § 300.605 Creditable service. (a) All service at the required or higher grade (or equivalent) in posi-tions to which appointed in the Federal civilian service is creditable towards the time periods required by §300.604 of this part, except as provided in para-graph (c) of this section. Creditable service includes competitive and ex-cepted service in positions under the General Schedule and other pay sys-tems, including employment with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality. Service while on detail is credited at the grade of the employee’s position of record, not the grade of the position to which detailed. Also creditable is serv-ice with the District of Columbia Gov-ernment prior to January 1, 1980 (or prior to September 26, 1980, for those District employees who were converted to the District personnel system on January 1, 1980). (b) Service in positions not subject to the General Schedule (GS) is credited at the equivalent GS grade by com-paring the candidate’s rate of basic pay with the representative rate (as defined in §351.203 of this chapter) of the GS position in effect when the non-GS service was performed. The equivalent GS grade is the GS grade with a rep- resentative rate that equals the can-didate’s rate of basic pay. When the candidate’s rate of basic pay falls be-tween the representative rates of two GS grades, the non-GS service is cred-ited at the higher grade. (c) In applying the restrictions in §300.604 of this part, prior service under temporary appointment at a level above that of a subsequent non-temporary competitive appointment is credited as if the service had been per-formed at the level of the non-temporary appointment.

Factors that may be appro-priate include the following: occupa-tional series, grade level, distinctive job duties, unique competencies re-quired for the position, assignment to a special project, minimum agency serv-ice requirements, organization or team designation, geographic location, and required rating of record. (While a rat-ing of record of higher than the ‘‘Fully Successful’’ rating of record required by §575.305(d) may be a factor used in defining the targeted category, a rat-ing of record by itself is not sufficient to justify a retention incentive. A rat-ing of record may function as a sup-porting factor in authorizing an incen-tive or setting the incentive rate only to the extent it directly relates to the conditions in paragraph (d) of this sec-tion.)

(a) Before paying retention incen- tives under this subpart, an agency must establish a retention incentive plan. This plan must include the fol-lowing elements: (1) The designation of officials with authority to review and approve pay-ment of retention incentives, subject to paragraph (b) of this section; (2) The categories of employees who are prohibited from receiving retention incentives; (3) Required documentation for deter- mining that an employee would be likely to leave the Federal service; (4) Any requirements for determining the amount of a retention incentive; (5) The payment methods that may be authorized; (6) Requirements governing service agreements which, at a minimum, must include— (i) The criteria for determining the length of a service period under a serv-ice agreement; (ii) The conditions for terminating a service agreement; (iii) The obligations of the agency if the agency terminates a service agree-ment; and (iv) The conditions for terminating retention incentive payments when no service agreement is required (see §575.310(f)); and (7) Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow recon-struction of the action and fulfill the requirements of §§575.312 and 575.313.

[70 FR 25747, May 13, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 67839, Dec. 3, 2007] § 575.308 Approval criteria and written determination. (a) An agency in its sole and exclu- sive discretion, subject only to OPM re-view and oversight, may approve a re-tention incentive for an individual em-ployee or group or category of employ-ees using the approval criteria in §575.306. (b) For each determination to pay a retention incentive under this subpart, an agency must document in writing— (1) The basis for determining that the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee (or group of employ-ees) or a special need of the agency for the employee’s (or group of employees’) services makes it essential to retain the employee(s); (2) The basis for determining that the employee (or a significant number of employees in a group) would be likely to leave the Federal service in the ab-sence of a retention incentive; and (3) The basis for establishing the amount and timing of the approved re-tention incentive payment and the length of the required service period. § 575.309 Payment of retention incen- tives. (a) An authorized agency official must determine the criteria for deter-mining the amount of a retention in-centive. An agency must establish a single retention incentive rate for each individual or group of employees that is expressed as a percentage of the em-ployee’s rate of basic pay. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this sec-tion, a retention incentive rate may not exceed— (1) 25 percent, if authorized for an in- dividual employee; or (2) 10 percent, if authorized for a group or category of employees. (b) An agency may pay a retention incentive in— (1) Installments after the completion of specified periods of service; or (2) A single lump-sum payment after completion of the full service period. (c)(1) An installment payment is de- rived by multiplying the rate of basic pay the employee earned in the install-ment period by a percentage not to ex-ceed the incentive percentage rate es-tablished for the employee under para-graph (a) of this section. For example, an agency establishes a retention in-centive percentage rate of 10 percent for an employee. The employee has a service agreement that provides for a retention incentive installment pay-ment after completion of 6 pay periods of service at the full percentage rate established for the employee. The em-ployee earns $15,000 during the 6 pay periods of service ($2,500 biweekly rate of basic pay × 6). Upon completion of that service period, the employee will receive the accrued retention incentive installment payment of $1,500 ($15,000 × .10). (2) If the retention incentive install- ment payment percentage is less than the full percentage rate established for the employee under paragraph (a) of this section, any accrued portion of the retention incentive that is not paid as an installment payment during the service period must be paid as part of a final installment payment to the em-ployee after completion of the full service period under the terms of the service agreement established under §575.310. For example, an agency estab-lishes a retention incentive percentage rate of 10 percent for an employee. The employee’s service agreement provides for a 7 percent retention incentive in-stallment payment after completion of 6 pay periods of service. The employee earns $15,000 during the 6 pay periods of service ($2,500 biweekly rate of basic pay × 6). Upon completion of that in- stallment period, the employee accrues a retention incentive installment pay-ment of $1,500 ($15,000', 'details and transfers shall not exceed 8 years in the aggregate. Re-fusal by the head of the agency to au-thorize the transfer or the extension of the transfer is not reviewable by or ap-pealable to OPM. (b) Letter of consent. When an agency consents to the transfer of an em-ployee, the agency shall give its con-sent in writing to the international or-ganization and shall furnish the em-ployee with a copy of the consent. (c) Effective date. The agency and the international organization shall estab-lish the effective date of transfer by mutual agreement. (d) Recording requirement. The agency must furnish the employee with a leave statement, showing his or her annual and sick leave balances at the time of transfer. In addition, the notification of personnel action effecting the em-ployee’s separation for transfer must include: (1) Identification of the international organization to which the employee is transferring, (2) A clear statement of the period during which the employee has reem-ployment rights in the agency under section 3582 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart, and (3) The legal and regulatory condi- tions for reemployment.

An employee who is transferred to an international organi-zation with the consent of the employ-ing agency is entitled to retain cov-erage for retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance purposes if he or she so chooses. The period during which coverage, rights, and benefits are retained under this paragraph, dur-ing employment with the international organization, is deemed employment by the United States. At the time an employing Federal agency consents to the transfer of an employee, the agency must advise the employee in writing of the employee’s right to continue re-tirement, health benefits, and group life insurance coverage, as applicable, for the duration of the assignment or transfer. The notice must explain the conditions for continued coverage and the employee’s obligations and respon-sibilities with regard to continued cov-erage. The notice must also explain that, if the employee elects to retain coverage, the agency will continue to make the agency contributions to the funds, and the employee’s coverage will continue as long as employee payments are currently deposited in the respec-tive funds. (b) Employee action. The employee must acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the notice and state whether or not he or she wishes to retain coverage under the retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance systems or any of them by continuing the required employee payments. The employee must make a written election to retain benefits, as applicable, and make ar-rangements for the required employee payments. An employee who transfers to an international organization is not eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) while employed by the international organization even if he or she elects to retain Federal re-tirement coverage. However, upon re-employment, an employee who elected to retain Federal retirement coverage while employed by the international organization and has made all deposits required for such coverage may make contributions to the TSP which he or she missed as a result of the service with an international organization, and receive make-up agency contribu-tions and lost earnings on the agency contributions, as provided under §352.311(e). (c) Agency responsibility. For retire- ment and group life insurance pur-poses, the employing agency is respon-sible for determining the applicable rate of pay in accordance with the pro-visions of section 3583 of title 5, United States Code. The agency is also respon-sible for collecting, accounting for, and depositing in the respective funds all VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00302 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR293 Office of Personnel Management § 352.312 retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance employee payments re-quired to be made for the purpose of protecting the rights of the employee so transferred; and for accounting for and depositing in the respective funds all agency contributions. The agency must furnish the employee with spe-cific information as to how, when, and where the payments are to be sub-mitted. (d) Coverage. Employee payments are considered to be currently deposited if received by the agency before, during, or within 3 months after the end of the pay period covered by the deposit. If the contributions are not currently de-posited, coverage terminates on the last day of the pay period for which the required contributions were currently deposited, subject to a 31-day extension of group life insurance and health bene- fits coverage as provided in parts 870 and 890 of this chapter and to the con-version benefits provided in parts 870 and 890 of this chapter. Coverage so terminated may not be re-established before the employee actually enters on duty, on the first day in a pay status in an agency. However, terminated retire-ment, health benefits, and group life insurance coverage must be reinstated retroactively when, in the judgment of OPM, the failure to make the required current deposit was due to cir-cumstances beyond the employee’s control and the required payments were deposited at the first opportunity. Coverage under a system other than the Civil Service Retirement System must be reinstated retroactively if the agency which administers the retire-ment system determines that the fail-ure to make the required current de-posit was due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee and the re-quired payments were deposited at the first opportunity. [73 FR 64860, Oct. 31, 2008] § 352.310 [Reserved] § 352.311 Reemployment. (a) An employee who transferred to an international organization with the consent of the employing agency is en-titled to be reemployed in his or her former position, or one of like senior-ity, status, and pay, within 30 days of applying for reemployment if the em- ployee: (1) Is separated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, without cause, within the term of employment with an inter-national organization; and (2) Applies for reemployment with the employing agency or its successor no later than 90 days after separation from the international organization. (b) Pay upon reemployment will be set at that to which the employee would have been entitled had the em-ployee remained with the employing agency. (c) When an employee’s reemploy- ment right is to a position in the SES, reemployment may be to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified. The employee must be re-turned at not less than the SES rate of basic pay as determined under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, at which the em-ployee was being paid immediately be-fore transfer to the international orga-nization, or if', 'is indefinite solely be-cause they occupy obligated positions; or whose tenure is equivalent to ca-reer-conditional in the competitive service. (b) Agency Exceptions. As an excep- tion to the general definition of part- time employment in §340.202(a) and under the authority provided in 5 U.S.C. 3402(a)(3), an agency may permit an employee who has an appointment in tenure group I or II to perform regu-larly scheduled work of from 1 to 15 hours per week. (c) Mixed Tours of Duty. The provi- sions of this subpart and the term ‘‘part-time career employment’’ do not apply to employees with appointments in tenure groups I or II who work under mixed tours of duty. For this purpose, a mixed tour of duty consists of annu-ally recurring periods of full-time, part-time, or intermittent service as long as the employee does not work part-time more than 6 pay periods per calendar year.

(b) Each agency shall include with such reports a copy of any agencywide part-time career employment program regulations and instructions issued during the 6-month period preceding the report date. (c) Reports should be sent to the As- sociate Director for Staffing Services, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. Subpart C [Reserved ] Subpart D—Seasonal and intermittent Employment SOURCE : 60 FR 3061, Jan. 13, 1995, unless otherwise noted. § 340.401 Definitions. (a) Seasonal employment means annu- ally recurring periods of work of less than 12 months each year. Seasonal employees are permanent employees who are placed in nonduty/nonpay sta-tus and recalled to duty in accordance with preestablished conditions of em-ployment. (b) Intermittent employment means em- ployment without a regularly sched-uled tour of duty. § 340.402 Seasonal employment. (a) Appropriate use. Seasonal employ- ment allows an agency to develop an experienced cadre of employees under career appointment to perform work which recurs predictably year-to-year. Consistent with the career nature of the appointments, seasonal employees receive the full benefits authorized to attract and retain a stable workforce. As a result, seasonal employment is ap-propriate when the work is expected to last at least 6 months during a cal-endar year. Recurring work that lasts less than 6 months each year is nor-mally best performed by temporary employees. Seasonal employment may not be used as a substitute for full-time employment or as a buffer for the full- time workforce. (b) Length of the season. Agencies de- termine the length of the season, sub-ject to the condition that it be clearly tied to nature of the work. The season must be defined as closely as prac-ticable so that an employee will have a reasonably clear idea of how much work he or she can expect during the year. To minimize the adverse impact of seasonal layoffs, an agency may as-sign seasonal employees to other work during the projected layoff period. While in nonpay status, a seasonal em- ployee may accept other employment, Federal or non-Federal, subject to the regulations on political activity (part 733 of this title) and on employee re-sponsibilities and conduct (part 735), as well as applicable agency policies. Sub-ject to the limitation on pay from more than one position (5 U.S.C. 5533), a seasonal employee may hold more than one appointment. (c) Employment agreement. An employ- ment agreement must be executed be-tween the agency and the seasonal em-ployee prior to the employee’s entering on duty. At a minimum, the agreement must inform the employee: (1) That he or she is subject to peri- odic release and recall as a condition of employment, (2) The minimum and maximum pe- riod the employee can expect to work, VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00275 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR266 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 340.403 (3) The basis on which release and re- call procedures will be effected, and (4) The benefits to which the em- ployee will be entitled while in a non-pay status. (d) Release and recall procedures. A seasonal employee is released to non-pay status at the end of a season and recalled to duty the next season. Re-lease and recall procedures must be es-tablished in advance and uniformly ap-plied. They may be based on perform-ance, seniority, veterans’ preference, other appropriate indices, or a com-bination of factors. A seasonal layoff is not subject to the procedures for fur-lough prescribed in parts 351 and 752 of this title. Reduction in force or adverse action procedures, as applicable, are required for a seasonal layoff that is not in accordance with the employ-ment agreement, for example, if an agency intends to have an employee work less than the minimum amount of time specified in the employment agreement. However, an agency may develop a new employment agreement to reflect changing circumstances. (e) Noncompetitive movement. Seasonal employees serving under career ap-pointment may move to other posi-tions in the same way as other regular career employees. § 340.403 Intermittent employment. (a) Appropriate use. An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in ad-vance. When an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time', '(1–1–25 Edition) § 630.1208 or procedures for providing notifica- tion of leave. The agency’s policies or procedures for providing notification of leave must not be more stringent than the requirements in this section. How-ever, an agency may not deny an em-ployee’s entitlement to leave under §630.1203(a) of this part if the employee fails to follow such agency policies or procedures. (g) An agency may require that a re- quest for leave under §630.1203(a) (1) and (2) be supported by evidence that is administratively acceptable to the agency.

Redesignated and amended at 76 FR 60704, 60705, Sept. 30, 2011] § 630.1208 Medical certification. (a) An agency may require that a re- quest for leave under §630.1203(a) (3) or (4) be supported by written medical certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the spouse, son, daugh-ter, or parent of the employee, as ap-propriate. An agency may waive the re-quirement for an initial medical cer-tificate in a subsequent 12-month pe-riod if the leave under §630.1203(a) (3) or (4) is for the same chronic or con-tinuing condition. (b) The written medical certification shall include— (1) The date the serious health condi- tion commenced; (2) The probable duration of the seri- ous health condition or specify that the serious health condition is a chron-ic or continuing condition with an un-known duration and whether the pa-tient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of epi-sodes of incapacity; (3) The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, ex-amination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider; (4) For the purpose of leave taken under §630.1203(a)(3) of this part— (i) A statement from the health care provider that the spouse, son, daugh-ter, or parent of the employee requires psychological comfort and/or physical care; needs assistance for basic med-ical, hygienic, nutritional, safety, or transportation needs or in making ar-rangements to meet such needs; and would benefit from the employee’s care or presence; and (ii) A statement from the employee on the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the amount of time needed to care for his or her spouse, son, daughter, or parent; (5) For the purpose of leave taken under §630.1203(a)(4), a statement that the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his or her position or requires medical treatment for a serious health condi-tion, based on written information pro-vided by the agency on the essential functions of the employee’s position or, if not provided, discussion with the em-ployee about the essential functions of his or her position; and (6) In the case of certification for intermittent leave or leave on a re-duced leave schedule under §630.1203(a) (3) or (4) for planned medical treat-ment, the dates (actual or estimates) on which such treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treat-ment, and the period of recovery, if any, or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of inca-pacity. (c) The information on the medical certification shall relate only to the serious health condition for which the current need for family and medical leave exists. The agency may not re-quire any personal or confidential in-formation in the written medical cer-tification other than that required by paragraph (b) of this section. If an em-ployee submits a completed medical certification signed by the health care provider, the agency may not request new information from the health care provider. However, a health care pro-vider representing the agency, includ-ing a health care provider employed by the agency or under administrative oversight of the agency, may contact the health care provider who completed VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00902 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR893 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1208 the medical certification, with the em- ployee’s permission, for purposes of clarifying the medical certification. (d) If the agency doubts the validity of the original certification provided under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency may require, at the agency’s expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a second health care pro-vider designated or approved by the agency concerning the information cer-tified under paragraph (b) of this sec-tion. Any health care provider des-ignated or approved by the agency shall not be employed by the agency or be under the administrative oversight of the agency on a regular basis unless the agency is located in an area where access to health care is extremely lim-ited—e.g., a rural area or an overseas location where no more than one or two health care providers practice in the relevant specialty, or the only health care providers available are em-ployed by the agency. (e) If the opinion of the second health care provider differs from the original certification provided under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency may re-quire, at the agency’s expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or ap-proved jointly by the agency and the employee concerning the information certified under paragraph (b) of this section. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be binding on the agency and the employee. (f) To remain entitled to family and medical leave under §630.1203(a) (3) or (4) of this part, an employee or the em-ployee’s spouse, son, daughter, or par-ent must comply with any requirement from an agency that he or she submit to examination (though not treatment) to obtain a second or third medical cer-tification from a health care provider other than the individual’s health care provider. (g) If the employee is unable to pro- vide the requested medical certifi-cation before leave begins, or if the agency questions the validity of the original certification provided by the employee and the medical treatment requires the leave to begin, the agency shall grant provisional leave pending final written medical certification. (h) An employee must provide the written medical certification required by paragraphs (a), (d), (e), and (g) of this section, signed by the health care provider, no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification.

The question touches on multiple critical aspects of federal employment regulations under Title 5, specifically addressing employee rights during international transfers. 

The usefulness stems from several key factors:
1. Relevance: Directly relates to federal employee benefits and rights during international organizational transfers
2. Practicality: Addresses a specific scenario that federal employees might actually experience, especially those in diplomatic, international development, or specialized agency roles
3. Complexity: Covers multiple benefit domains (retirement, health insurance, life insurance) which require nuanced understanding of federal regulations
4. Information Need: Provides critical guidance for employees considering or undergoing international assignments
5. Applicability: Helps employees understand their rights and potential implications of transferring to an international organization

HR specialists, managers handling international assignments, and federal employees considering such transfers would find this question extremely valuable. It requires understanding specific provisions in Title 5 regarding benefit preservation, potential continuation or modification of federal benefits, and the legal framework governing such transitions."

Head of agency means the head of an agency or an official who has been del-egated the authority to act for the head of the agency in the matter con-cerned.

Unless a higher initial maximum uni- form allowance rate is payable under §591.104 to an employee who is required by statute, regulation, or an agency’s written administrative procedures to wear a uniform, the head of each agen- cy concerned, out of funds available, shall— (a) Pay an allowance for a uniform not to exceed $800 a year; or (b) Furnish a uniform at a cost not to exceed $800 a year. (c) Any agency which provides a uni- form allowance under paragraph (a) of this section must establish policies to administer the uniform allowance pro-gram, including uniform standards ac-ceptable to the agency.

(a) The head of an agency may estab- lish one or more initial maximum uni-form allowance rates greater than the Governmentwide maximum uniform al-lowance rate established under §591.103. (b) A higher initial maximum uni- form allowance rate established under this section may not exceed the aver-age total uniform cost for the min-imum basic uniform for the affected employees and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, applies only to the year in which the employee becomes subject to a requirement to wear the uniform. (c) An agency that establishes one or more higher initial maximum uniform allowance rates under this section may divide the cost of the minimum basic uniform and continue a higher initial maximum uniform allowance for the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the require-ment to wear the uniform, provided the agency publishes a notice of its inten-tion to continue such payments in the F EDERAL REGISTER for notice and com- ment. (d) Before establishing a higher ini- tial maximum uniform allowance rate under this section, an agency shall publish in the F EDERAL REGISTER for notice and comment— (1) A description and justification of the circumstances requiring a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate; (2) An estimate of the number of em- ployees affected; (3) The specific items required for the basic uniform and the average total uniform cost for the affected employ-ees; (4) The amount of the proposed high- er initial maximum uniform allowance rate to be paid during the year the em-ployee first becomes subject to the uni-form requirement; (5) The proposed effective date of the higher initial maximum uniform allow-ance rate; and, (6) The intent of the agency (if any) to divide the cost of a minimum basic uniform and continue to make higher initial maximum basic uniform allow-ance payments in the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the uniform requirement. (e) So that OPM can evaluate agen- cies’ use of this authority and provide the Congress and others with informa-tion regarding the use of a higher ini-tial maximum uniform allowance rate, each agency concerned shall maintain such other records and submit to OPM such other reports and data as OPM shall require.

It demonstrates a practical information need that would be valuable for multiple stakeholders:

1. For HR Specialists: The question directly relates to their critical responsibility of interpreting and applying leave policies during medical emergencies.

2. For Federal Employees: Understanding the criteria for qualifying as a leave recipient during a medical emergency is crucial for employees who might need additional leave support during challenging personal health situations.

3. For Managers: The question helps managers understand the agency's guidelines for processing medical emergency leave requests and supporting employees.

The question is technically specific, targeting a nuanced aspect of federal employment leave regulations. It seeks substantive information about procedural determinations, which suggests a genuine need to understand the precise mechanisms of leave allocation during medical emergencies.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it's somewhat narrowly focused on a specific leave scenario. However, it remains a highly practical and relevant inquiry that would provide meaningful insights into federal employment leave policies under Title 5."
" What is the definition of an ""employee"" according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations?"," According to the policy, an employee has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 2105, with two additional inclusions: (1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e), and (2) An individual employed by a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality who is moved without a break in service of more than 3 days to a position under a covered pay system in the same agency.","['2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00582 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR573 Office of Personnel Management § 536.103 a single rate, the single rate of basic pay for that position; and (2) For the purpose of comparing grades or levels of work in making rea-sonable offer determinations when one of the grades or levels of work is not under a covered pay system and after applying any applicable geographic conversion rules under §536.105(b) for positions with different official work-sites— (i) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade of a position covered by the General Sched-ule; (ii) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade of a position under a regular prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chap-ter 53, subchapter IV, or in the case of a prevailing rate position with a single rate, the single rate of basic pay for that position; and (iii) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade or level of work in the case of a position not covered by paragraph (2)(i) or (ii) of this definition. In the case of a position with a single rate under such a sched-ule, the single rate of basic pay for that position is the comparison rate. Covered pay system means a covered pay schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5361(5)— i.e., the General Schedule pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chap-ter 53, subchapter III; a prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chap-ter 53, subchapter IV; or a special occu-pational pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IX. The various prevailing rate systems under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, are considered separate systems if they have separate job grading structures. Employed on a temporary or term basis means employment under an appoint-ment having a definite time limitation or designated as temporary or term. Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that em- ployee also includes— (1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and (2) An individual employed by a De- partment of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) who is moved without a break in service of more than 3 days from employment in such an instrumentality to a position under a covered pay system in the same agency. FEPCA means the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101–509, November 5, 1990, as amended). General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. This term also refers to the pay schedule estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. 5332. Highest applicable rate range means the rate range applicable to an em-ployee based on a given position of record and official worksite that pro-vides the highest rates of basic pay, ex-cluding any retained rates. For exam-ple, a rate range of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305 may exceed an applicable locality rate range under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for General Schedule employees. In certain circumstances, the highest ap- plicable rate range may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules—e.g., a range where special rates are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range. Management action means an action (not for personal cause) by an agency official not initiated or requested by an employee which may adversely affect the employee’s grade or rate of basic pay. However, an employee’s placement in or transfer to a position under a for-mal employee development program es-tablished by an agency for recruitment and employee advancement purposes (e.g., Recent Graduates Program) is considered a management action even though the employee initiates or re-quests such placement or transfer. Official worksite means the official lo- cation of the employee’s position of record as determined under the rules of the applicable pay system (e.g., 5 CFR 531.605 for General Schedule employ-ees). Official worksite is synonymous with the term ‘‘official duty station’’ as used in 5 U.S.C. 5363(c). OPM means the Office of Personnel Management.

Pay schedule means a set of rate ranges established under a single au-thority— i.e., the General Schedule, a law enforcement officer special base rate schedule (for grades GS–3 through 10) under section 403 of FEPCA; a pre-vailing rate schedule (including a spe-cial schedule or special rate schedule) under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on GS rates; a local-ity rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on law enforcement officer spe-cial base rates (for grades GS–3 through 10); or a special rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar author-ity. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the es-tablished coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee be-cause of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Prevailing rate employee has the mean- ing given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5342(a)(2) and refers to an employee', 'years or less except that the appointee may not serve in one or more positions in the agency under such appointment in excess of 3 years.

As provided for in §§317.702 and 317.703, an agency may reinstate a former SES career appointee without regard to the merit staffing require-ments established by OPM in §317.501(c). § 317.702 General reinstatement: SES career appointees. (a) Eligibility for general reinstatement. A former SES career appointee who meets the following conditions is eligi-ble for reinstatement under this sec-tion: (1) The individual completed an SES probationary period under a previous SES career appointment or was ex-empted from that requirement; and (2) The individual’s separation from his or her last SES career appointment was not a removal under subpart C of part 359 of this chapter for failure to be recertified as a senior executive; or a removal under subpart E of part 359 of this chapter for less than fully success-ful executive performance; or under 5 U.S.C. 1207 by order of the Merit Sys-tems Protection Board as a result of a disciplinary action initiated by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. 1206; or under 5 U.S.C. 7532 (National Security); or under subpart F of part 752 of this chapter for misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance; or a resignation after receipt of a notice proposing or directing removal under any of the above conditions. Removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment to another commuting area, or to accom- pany a position in a transfer of func-tion to another commuting area, does not preclude reinstatement to the SES unless the appointment to the original position included acceptance of a writ-ten nationwide mobility agreement or policy. (b) Applying for reinstatement; time limit. Application for reinstatement under this section shall be made di-rectly to the agency in which SES em-ployment is sought. There is no time limit for reinstatement under this sec-tion. (c) Qualifications. The individual must meet the qualification require- ments of the position to which rein-stated. The agency makes this deter-mination. (d) Tenure upon reinstatement. An in- dividual who is reinstated under §317.702 becomes an SES career ap-pointee. [54 FR 9759, Mar. 8, 1989, as amended at 56 FR 172, Jan. 3, 1991] § 317.703 Guaranteed reinstatement: Presidential appointees. (a) Eligibility for reinstatement. (1) A former SES career appointee who was appointed by the President to a civil service position outside the SES with-out a break in service, and who left the Presidential appointment for reasons other than misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance, is entitled by law to be reinstated to the SES. (2) If an individual is serving under a Presidential appointment with rein-statement entitlement and receives an-other Presidential appointment with-out a break in service between the two appointments, the individual continues to be entitled to be reinstated to the SES following termination of the sec-ond appointment. If there is an interim period between the two Presidential appointments, the individual must be reinstated as an SES career appointee before the effective date of the second appointment to preserve reinstatement entitlement following termination of the second appointment.

An application may be submitted as soon as the Presi-dential appointee’s resignation is re-quested or submitted. (c) Directing reinstatement. (1) To the extent practicable, OPM will direct re-instatement within 45 days of the date of receipt by OPM of the application for reinstatement or the date of separa-tion from the Presidential appoint-ment, whichever is later. (2) OPM will use the following order of precedence in directing reinstate-ment of a former Presidential ap-pointee: (i) The agency in which the indi- vidual last served as an SES career ap-pointee before accepting the Presi-dential appointment; (ii) The successor agency to the one in which the individual last served as an SES career appointee; (iii) The agency or agencies in which the individual served as a Presidential appointee; or (iv) Any other agency in the Execu- tive branch with positions under the SES. (3) The agency being directed to take the reinstatement action is responsible for assigning the individual to a posi-tion for which he or she meets the qualifications requirements. (4) When directing the reinstatement of a Presidential appointee, OPM may, as appropriate, allocate an additional SES space authority to the agency. (5) When a Presidential appointee tenders his or her resignation, volun-tarily or upon request, the agency in which the Presidential appointment was held, upon approval by OPM, may place the appointee as an interim measure on an SES limited term or limited emergency appointment as ap-propriate, pending reinstatement, to preclude a break in service after the Presidential appointment has termi-nated. (6) To preserve reinstatement rights', '(b)(4)(i) of this section must be currently married to the mem-ber of the armed forces on active duty.

(a) Telework employees. (1) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, employees who are partici-pating in a telework program and are able to safely travel to and work at an approved telework site may not be granted leave under §630.1603. Employ-ees who are eligible to telework and participating in a telework program under applicable agency policies are typically able to safely perform work at their approved telework site (e.g., home), since they are not required to work at their regular worksite. (2)(i) If, in the agency’s judgment, the conditions in §630.1603 could not reasonably be anticipated, an agency may provide leave under this subpart to the extent an employee was not able to prepare for telework as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and is otherwise unable to perform productive work at the telework site. (ii) If an employee is prevented from safely working at the approved telework site due to circumstances, arising from one or more of the condi-tions in §630.1603, applicable to the telework site, an agency may, at its discretion, provide leave under this subpart to the employee. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, an agency may decide not to provide leave under this subpart when the conditions in §630.1603 do not prevent the em-ployee from safely traveling to or safe-ly performing work at a regular work-site, even if the affected day is a sched-uled telework day. (3) In making a determination under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an agency must evaluate whether any of the conditions in §630.1603 could be rea-sonably anticipated and whether the employee took reasonable steps (within the employee’s control) to prepare to perform telework at the approved telework site. For example, if a signifi-cant snowstorm is predicted, the em-ployee may need to prepare by taking home any equipment (e.g., laptop com- puter) and work needed for tele-working. To the extent that an em-ployee is unable to perform work at a telework site because of failure to make necessary preparations for rea-sonably anticipated conditions, an agency may not provide weather and safety leave, and the employee would need to use other appropriate paid leave, paid time off, or leave without pay. (b) Emergency employees. An agency may designate emergency employees who are critical to agency operations and for whom weather and safety leave may not be applicable. To the extent practicable, an agency should inform employees of their designation as emergency employees well in advance in anticipation of the possible occur-rence of the conditions set forth in §630.1603. If the agency wishes to pro-vide for the possibility that an emer-gency employee could work from an ap-proved telework site in lieu of trav-eling to the regular worksite in appro-priate circumstances, an agency should encourage the employee to enter into a telework agreement providing for that contingency. An agency may designate different emergency employees for the different circumstances expected to arise from these conditions. Emergency employees must report to work at their regular worksite or another approved location as directed by the agency, un-less— (1) The agency determines that travel to or performing work at the worksite is unsafe for emergency employees, in which case the agency may require the employees to work at another location, including a telework site as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, as appro-priate; or (2) The agency determines that cir- cumstances justify granting leave under this subpart to emergency em-ployees. § 630.1606 Administration of weather and safety leave. (a) An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for weather and safety leave as it does for annual and sick leave under §630.206.

For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic work-week as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under §630.210. (c) Employees may not receive weather and safety leave for hours dur-ing which they are on other preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or paid time off. Agencies should not pro-vide weather and safety leave to an em-ployee who, in the agency’s judgment, is cancelling preapproved leave or paid time off, or changing a regular day off in a flexible or compressed work sched-ule, for the primary purpose of obtain-ing weather and safety leave. § 630.1607 Records and reporting. (a) Record of placement on leave. An agency must maintain an accurate record of the placement of an employee on weather and safety leave. (b) Reporting. In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record weather and safety leave under section 6329c and this sub-part as a category of leave separate from other types of leave. Subpart Q—Paid Parental Leave § 630.1701 Purpose, applicability, and agency responsibilities. (a) Purpose. This subpart provides regulations to govern the granting of paid parental leave to covered employ-ees. Since paid parental leave may only be substituted for unpaid leave granted following a birth or placement under specific provisions', 'as well as those paid by com-mission. (4) In addition to all standard North American Industry Classification Sys-tem (NAICS) codes currently used on the regular surveys, the industries sur- veyed will include— 2022 NAICS Codes 2022 NAICS Industry titles 441110 .......

(5) The surveys will cover establish- ments with a total employment of eight or more. (6) The special schedules for NAF automotive mechanics will be effective on the same dates as the regular wage schedules in the NAF FWS wage area. (d) New employees will be hired at step 1 of the position under the flat rate pay system. Current employees will be moved to these special wage schedules on a step-by-step basis.

The definition of ""employee"" is fundamental to understanding rights, benefits, and legal protections under Title 5 regulations. HR specialists, managers, and federal workers need a clear understanding of who qualifies as an employee to correctly apply personnel policies, determine benefit eligibility, and ensure proper classification. 

The question addresses a core definitional issue that impacts multiple aspects of federal employment, including:
- Benefit entitlements
- Leave and compensation rules
- Performance management
- Hiring and classification procedures
- Legal rights and protections

This type of foundational knowledge is critical for:
- New HR professionals understanding regulatory frameworks
- Managers making staffing and classification decisions
- Employees seeking to understand their organizational status
- Legal professionals interpreting employment regulations

The question demonstrates a substantive information need that goes beyond surface-level inquiries, seeking to clarify a key definitional concept that has significant practical implications across federal employment settings. Its broad relevance and potential to provide crucial regulatory insight make it highly valuable for multiple stakeholders."
" Under what circumstances can an agency medically disqualify a job applicant, and what approval is needed?
"," Per §339.306, agencies are authorized to medically disqualify a nonpreference eligible, who then has the right to a higher-level review within the agency. However, for preference eligible employees or veterans with 30% or more disability, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must approve the sufficiency of the agency's reasons for medical disqualification. This approval is required for various scenarios, such as selecting a nonpreference eligible over a preference eligible, passing over a disabled veteran, or medically disqualifying a veteran for a position or reassignment.","['§§339.301 or 339.302, or the results of any previous medical treatments or evalua-tions relative to the identified medical issue, to authorized agency representa-tives, including the agency physician or medical review officer and/or inde-pendent medical specialists, may be a basis for disqualification for the posi-tion by the hiring agency. In addition, an employee may be subject to adverse action. (b) The agency designates the exam- ining physician or other appropriate practitioner, but must offer the appli-cant or employee an opportunity to submit medical documentation from his or her private physician or practi-tioner for consideration in the medical examination process. The agency must review and consider all such docu-mentation supplied by the private phy-sician or practitioner. The applicant or employee must authorize release of this documentation to all authorized agency representatives. In situations where the medical documentation of the applicant or employee’s private physician or practitioner is contradic- tory and cannot be resolved by the ex-amining physician or the agency physi-cian or medical review officer, the agency may, at its option, pursue an-other opinion from an appropriate spe-cialist at agency expense. An applicant or employee also may, at his or her op-tion, pursue another opinion from an appropriate specialist at his or her ex-pense in the event of conflicting or contradictory medical documentation. § 339.304 Payment for examination. (a) An agency must pay for all med- ical and/or psychological and/or psy-chiatric examinations required or of-fered by the agency under this subpart, whether conducted by the agency’s physician or medical review officer, an independent medical evaluation spe-cialist (e.g., occupational audiologist) identified by the agency, or a licensed physician or practitioner chosen by the applicant or employee. This includes special evaluations or diagnostic proce-dures required by an agency. (b) Following conclusion of the ini- tial medical, psychological, and/or psy-chiatric examination, the agency phy-sician or medical review officer will render a final medical determination. In certain final medical ineligibility determinations, the agency physician or medical review officer may reference supplemental medical examination, testing or documentation, which the applicant or employee may submit to the agency for consideration and fur-ther review relative to potential med-ical eligibility. Under these cir-cumstances, the applicant or employee is responsible for payment of this fur-ther examination, testing and docu-mentation. (c) An applicant or employee must pay to obtain all relevant medical doc-umentation from his or her private li-censed physician or required practi-tioners in instances where no medical examination is required or offered by the agency, but where the agency re-quests the applicant or employee to provide medical documentation rel-ative to an identified medical or phys-ical condition in question or where the agency needs medical documentation VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00270 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR261 Office of Personnel Management § 340.101 to render an informed management de- cision. (d) An applicant or employee must pay for a medical examination con-ducted by his or her private licensed physician or practitioner where the purpose of the examination is to secure a change sought by an applicant (e.g., new employment) or by an employee (e.g., a request for change in duty sta-tus, reasonable accommodation, and/or job modification). § 339.305 Records and reports. (a) Agencies will receive and main- tain all medical documentation and records of examinations obtained under this part in accordance with part 293, subpart E, of this chapter. (b) The report of an examination con- ducted under this subpart must be made available to the applicant or em-ployee under the provisions of part 297 of this chapter. (c) Agencies must forward to the Of- fice of Workers’ Compensation Pro-grams (OWCP), Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, a copy of all medical documentation and reports of examinations of employ-ees who are receiving or have applied for injury compensation benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, including continu-ation of pay. The agency must also re-port to OWCP the failure of such em-ployees to report for examinations that the agency orders under this subpart. When the employee has applied for dis-ability retirement, this information and any medical documentation or re-ports of examination must be for-warded to OPM. § 339.306 Processing medical eligibility determinations. (a) In accordance with the provisions of this part, agencies are authorized to medically disqualify a nonpreference eligible. A nonpreference eligible so disqualified has a right to a higher level review of the determination with-in the agency. (b) OPM must approve the sufficiency of the agency’s reasons to: (1) Medically disqualify or pass over a preference eligible in order to select a nonpreference eligible for: (i) A competitive service position under part 332 of this chapter; or (ii) An excepted service position in the executive branch subject to title 5, U.S. Code; (2) Medically disqualify or pass over a 30 percent or more compensably dis-abled veteran for a position in the U.S. Postal Service in favor of a non-preference eligible; (3) Medically disqualify a 30 percent or more compensably disabled veteran for assignment to another position in a reduction in force under §351.702(d) of this chapter; or (4) Medically disqualify a 30 percent or more disabled veteran for non-competitive appointment, for example, under §316.302(b)(4) of this chapter.

(2) Any general pay adjustment (in- cluding a retained rate adjustment under §536.305) that takes effect on the same date as an action described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be processed first, before any other pay action and before applying the rules in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (b), or (c) of this section, as applicable. (3) If the location of an employee’s official worksite changes in conjunc-tion with an action that may provide initial entitlement to pay retention, the agency must apply the geographic conversion rule under §536.303(a) before applying the rules in paragraph (b) of this section. The converted rate of basic pay must be treated as the em-ployee’s existing payable rate of basic pay in applying those rules. (4) If the location of an employee’s official worksite changes while he or she is receiving a retained rate, the agency must apply the geographic con-version rule under §536.303(b) before ap-plying the rules in paragraph (c) of this section. The converted retained rate must be treated as the employee’s ex-isting retained rate in applying those rules.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 536.304 effective date as other pay actions that affect an employee’s rate of basic pay, the actions must be processed in the order prescribed under the rules gov-erning the covered pay system of the employee’s position of record (e.g., 5 CFR 531.206 for GS positions and 5 CFR 532.413 for Federal Wage System posi-tions). (6) In applying this section, an agen- cy must convert an employee’s existing annual rate of pay to an hourly rate of pay if the employee’s new position is under a pay system that uses only hourly rates. An agency must convert an employee’s existing hourly rate of pay to an annual rate of pay if the em-ployee’s new position is under a pay system that uses annual rates of pay. (b) Determining initial pay retention entitlement. When an employee becomes entitled to pay retention under §536.301 or 536.302, the agency must determine the employee’s pay retention entitle-ment under the following rules (subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section): (1) If an employee’s existing payable rate of basic pay is less than or equal to the maximum rate of the highest ap-plicable rate range for the grade of the employee’s position of record imme-diately after the event causing the pay retention entitlement, the employee is entitled to the lowest rate of basic pay in such rate range that equals or ex-ceeds the employee’s existing payable rate of basic pay. If an employee’s pay-able rate of basic pay is set at or below the maximum rate of the highest appli-cable rate range, pay retention under this subpart ceases to apply to the em-ployee. (2) If the employee’s existing payable rate of basic pay is greater than the maximum rate of the highest applica-ble rate range for the grade of the em- ployee’s position immediately after the event causing the pay retention enti-tlement, the employee is entitled to a retained rate equal to the employee’s existing payable rate of basic pay, sub-ject to the limitations in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (3) A newly established retained rate may not exceed— (i) 150 percent of the maximum pay- able rate of basic pay of the highest ap-plicable rate range for the grade of the employee’s position of record; or (ii) The Executive Level IV max- imum rate limitation established under §536.306. (4) In applying this section for an em- ployee who becomes eligible for pay re-tention while serving on a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment, the agency must use the rate of basic pay the employee would have received if the temporary promotion or tem-porary reassignment had not occurred. (c) Redetermining pay retention entitle- ment at time of change in position or pay schedule. When an employee receiving a retained rate undergoes a change in po-sition or pay schedule that results in a new highest applicable rate range (and when the terminating conditions for pay retention under §536.308(a)(1), (3), (4), and (5) do not apply), the agency must determine the employee’s pay re-tention entitlement under the fol-lowing rules (subject to the require-ments in paragraph (a) of this section): (1) If the employee’s grade and pay system are not changing and if the em-ployee’s existing retained rate is less than or equal to the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee’s position of record im-mediately after the position or sched-ule change, the employee is entitled to the maximum rate of the highest appli-cable rate range, and pay retention ceases to apply. (2) If the employee’s grade and pay system are not changing and if the em-ployee’s existing retained rate is great-er than the maximum rate on the high-est applicable rate range for the em-ployee’s position of record immediately after the position or schedule change, the employee continues to be entitled to the existing retained rate. (3) If the employee’s pay system is not changing but the employee is being promoted to a higher-graded position, the agency must apply the applicable promotion rules to determine the em-ployee’s payable rate of basic pay (e.g., the rules in 5 CFR 531.214(d)(5) for GS positions and 5 CFR 532.407 for Federal Wage System positions). If the pro-motion action results in a terminating condition as described in §536.308 (e.g., the resulting rate is equal to or greater than the existing retained rate), pay VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00592 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR583 Office of Personnel Management']",4,"The context provides detailed information about medical disqualification procedures, specifically in section 339.306, which outlines that agencies can medically disqualify a nonpreference eligible and requires OPM approval for medically disqualifying or passing over preference eligible candidates, 30% or more compensably disabled veterans, and provides specific conditions under which such disqualification can occur, with only minor details about the specific medical grounds for disqualification potentially missing.",5,"This is an excellent and highly practical question that directly addresses critical aspects of federal employment regulations under Title 5. The question explores medical qualification standards, which are crucial for both job applicants and federal agencies in ensuring fair hiring practices while maintaining necessary job performance standards.

The question is particularly useful because it:
1. Addresses a sensitive and complex area of federal employment law
2. Seeks to understand the procedural and legal boundaries of medical disqualification
3. Has direct relevance for HR specialists, hiring managers, and job applicants
4. Touches on important issues of disability rights, employment equity, and job-related medical standards
5. Requires understanding of specific regulatory requirements and approval processes

For HR professionals, this question helps clarify the legal and procedural constraints around medical evaluations in hiring. For job applicants, it provides insight into potential barriers and their rights. The question demonstrates a nuanced approach to understanding how medical qualifications are assessed in federal employment, making it highly valuable for anyone involved in or studying federal hiring practices."

This part applies to all incumbents of, and candidates for, supervisory, managerial, and executive positions in the General Schedule, the Senior Exec-utive Service (SES), or equivalent pay systems also covered by part 410 of this chapter. § 412.102 Purpose. (a) This part implements for super- visors, managers, and executives the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, re-lated to training, and 5 U.S.C. 3396, re-lated to the criteria for programs of systematic development of candidates for the SES and the continuing devel-opment of SES members. (b) This part identifies a continuum of leadership development, starting with supervisory positions and pro-ceeding through management and exec-utive positions Governmentwide. For this reason, this part provides require-ments by which agencies: (1) Develop the competencies needed by supervisors, managers, and execu-tives; (2) Provide learning through con- tinuing development and training in the context of succession planning; and (3) Foster a broad agency and Gov- ernmentwide perspective to prepare in-dividuals for advancement, thus sup-plying the agency and the Government with an adequate number of well-pre-pared and qualified candidates to fill leadership positions. Subpart B—Succession Planning § 412.201 Management succession. The head of each agency, in consulta- tion with OPM, must develop a com-prehensive management succession program, based on the agency’s work-force succession plans, to fill agency supervisory and managerial positions. These programs must be supported by employee training and development programs. The focus of the program should be to develop managers as well as strengthen organizational capa-bility, and to ensure an adequate num-ber of well-prepared and qualified can-didates for leadership positions. These programs must: (a) Implement developmental train- ing consistent with agency succession management plans; (b) Provide continuing learning expe- riences throughout an employee’s ca-reer, such as details, mentoring, coach-ing, learning groups, and projects. These experiences should provide broad knowledge and practical experience linked to OPM’s Federal leadership competencies, as well as agency-identi-fied, mission-related competencies, and should be consistent with the agency’s succession management plan; and (c) Include program evaluations pur- suant to 5 CFR 410.202.

All agencies must provide for the de- velopment of individuals in super-visory, managerial and executive posi-tions, as well as individuals whom the agency identifies as potential can-didates for those positions, based on the agencies’ succession plans. Agen-cies also must issue written policies to ensure they: (a) Design and implement leadership development programs integrated with the employee development plans, pro-grams, and strategies required by 5 CFR 410.201, and that foster a broad agency and Governmentwide perspec-tive; (b) Provide training within one year of an employee’s initial appointment to a supervisory position and follow up periodically, but at least once every three years, by providing each super-visor and manager additional training on the use of appropriate actions, op-tions, and strategies to: (1) Mentor employees; (2) Improve employee performance and productivity; (3) Conduct employee performance appraisals in accordance with agency appraisal systems; and (4) Identify and assist employees with unacceptable performance. (c) Provide training when individuals make critical career transitions, for in-stance from non-supervisory to man-ager or from manager to executive. This training should be consistent with assessments of the agency’s and the in-dividual’s needs. Subpart C—Senior']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the Emergency Leave Transfer Program, specifically stating that the President must declare a major disaster or emergency that results in severe adverse effects for a substantial number of employees, which directly addresses the key conditions for establishing the program.",4,"This question is highly relevant and practical for federal employees and HR specialists. The Emergency Leave Transfer Program is a specific provision within Title 5 that allows federal employees to donate leave to colleagues facing personal or family medical emergencies. By asking about the conditions for presidential establishment of such a program, the question addresses an important policy mechanism that can provide critical support to federal workers during challenging times.

The question demonstrates a substantive interest in understanding the regulatory framework for emergency leave transfers, which has direct implications for:
1. Employee welfare and support systems
2. HR policy implementation
3. Interdepartmental leave donation procedures
4. Understanding executive discretion in establishing emergency support programs

While not a daily concern for all federal employees, this question would be particularly valuable for HR professionals, union representatives, and employees interested in comprehensive understanding of federal leave policies. The technical nature of the question suggests a serious information need related to specific regulatory conditions, making it a meaningful inquiry into Title 5 provisions.

The practicality is high because emergency situations can arise unexpectedly, and knowing the conditions for establishing such a program could be crucial for employees and managers seeking support during critical personal circumstances."
" What factors must an agency consider when determining whether a position is likely to be difficult to fill for the purpose of offering a relocation incentive?
"," According to §575.206, an agency must consider eight key factors:

2. Salaries typically paid outside the Federal Government for similar positions
3. Recent turnover in similar positions
4. Employment trends and labor market factors
5. Special or unique competencies required
6. Agency efforts to use non-pay authorities like special training and work scheduling flexibilities
7. Desirability of duties, work environment, or geographic location
8. Other supporting factors

(a) Service of a complaint must be made by certified or registered mail or by delivery in any manner authorized by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service is complete upon receipt. (b) Proof of service, stating the name and address of the person on whom the complaint was served, and the manner and date of service, may be made by: (1) Affidavit of the individual serving the complaint by delivery; (2) A United States Postal Service re- turn receipt card acknowledging re-ceipt; or (3) Written acknowledgment of re- ceipt by the defendant or his or her representative. § 185.109 Answer. (a) The defendant may request a hearing in the answer filed with the re-viewing official within 30 days of serv-ice of the complaint. (b) In the answer, the defendant: (1) Shall admit or deny each of the allegations of liability made in the complaint; (2) Shall state any defense on which the defendant intends to rely; (3) May state any reasons why the de- fendant contends that the penalties and assessments should be less than the statutory maximum; and (4) Shall state the name, address, and telephone number of the person author-ized by the defendant to act as defend-ant’s representative, if any. (c) If the defendant is unable to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section within the time provided, the defendant may, be-fore the expiration of 30 days from service of the complaint, file with the reviewing official a general answer de-nying liability and requesting a hear-ing, and a request for an extension of time within which to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The reviewing offi-cial shall file promptly with the ALJ the complaint, the general answer de-nying liability, and the request for an extension of time as provided in §185.110. For good cause shown, the ALJ may grant the defendant up to 30 additional days within which to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The ALJ shall decide expeditiously whether the dependent shall be granted an addi-tional period of time to file such an-swer.

(a) If the defendant does not file an answer within the time prescribed in §185.109(a), the reviewing official may refer the complaint to the ALJ. (b) Upon the referral of the com- plaint, the ALJ shall promptly serve on the defendant in the manner pre-scribed in §185.108, a notice that an ini-tial decision will be issued under this section. (c) The ALJ shall assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and, if such facts establish liability under §185.103, the ALJ shall issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of penalties and assessments allowed under the statute. (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, by failing to file a timely answer the defendant waives any right to further review of the penalties and assessments imposed under paragraph (c) of this section and the initial deci-sion shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after it is issued. (e) If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant files a motion with the ALJ seeking to reopen on the grounds that extraordinary cir-cumstances prevented the defendant from filing an answer, the initial deci-sion shall be stayed pending the ALJ’s decision on the motion. (f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary cir-cumstances excusing the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ shall with-draw the initial decision in paragraph (c) of this section, if such a decision has been issued, and shall grant the de-fendant an opportunity to answer the complaint. (g) A decision of the ALJ denying a defendant’s motion under paragraph (e) of this section is not subject to recon-sideration under §185.138. (h) The defendant may appeal to the authority head the decision denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head within 15 days after the ALJ denies the mo-tion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal shall stay the initial decision until the authority head decides the issue. (i) If the defendant files a timely no- tice of appeal with the authority head, the ALJ shall forward the record of the proceeding to the authority head. (j) The authority head shall decide expeditiously whether extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant’s failure to file a timely answer based solely on the record before the ALJ. (k) If the authority head decides that extraordinary circumstances excused the defendant’s failure to file a timely answer, the authority head shall re-mand the case to the ALJ with instruc-tions to grant the defendant an oppor-tunity to answer. (l) If the authority head decides that the defendant’s failure to file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such de-cision. § 185.111 Referral of complaint and an- swer to the ALJ. Upon receipt of an answer, the re- viewing official shall file the complaint and answer with the ALJ. § 185.112 Notice of hearing. (a) When the ALJ receives the com- plaint and answer, the ALJ shall promptly serve a notice of hearing upon the defendant in the manner pre-scribed by §185.108. At the same time, the ALJ shall send a copy of such no-tice to the reviewing official or his or her designee. (b) Such notice shall include: (1) The tentative time and place, and the nature of the hearing; (2) The legal authority and jurisdic- tion under which the hearing is to be held; (3) The matters of fact and law to be asserted; (4) A description of the procedures for the conduct of the hearing; (5) The name, address, and telephone number of the representative of the Government and of the defendant, if any;', 'employee (or job candidate) has an outstanding student loan that qualifies for repayment under this part. The agency must verify remain-ing balances to ensure that loans are not overpaid. (2) The agency may repay more than one loan if the employee’s student loan repayment benefit does not exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. (3) These regulations do not impose a limit on the age of a student loan for qualification purposes. The agency may, however, specify in its agency plan that only student loans made within a certain timeframe are eligible for repayment. (c) Benefit amount. (1) In determining the amount of student loan repayment benefits to approve, an agency must consider the employee’s (or job can-didate’s) value to the agency and how far in advance the agency is permitted to commit funds. If an agency decides to make additional student loan repay-ment benefits contingent on budget levels or other factors, it must address these contingent benefits in the writ- ten service agreement as described in §537.107(a). (2) The amount of student loan re- payment benefits provided by an agen-cy is subject to both of the following limits: (i) $10,000 per employee per calendar year; and (ii) A total of $60,000 per employee. (3) In applying the limits in para- graph (c)(2) of this section, the agency must count the full student loan repay-ment benefit ( i.e., before deducting any tax withholdings as described in para-graph (a)(6)(iii) of this section). (d) Employee responsibility. Loan pay- ments made by an agency under this part do not exempt an employee from his or her responsibility and/or liabil-ity for any loan(s) the individual has taken out. The employee also is re-sponsible for any income tax obliga-tions resulting from the student loan repayment benefit. § 537.107 Service agreements. (a) Before an employing agency makes any loan payments for an em-ployee, the employee (or job candidate) must sign a written service agreement to complete a specified period of serv-ice with the agency and to reimburse the agency for the student loan repay-ment benefit when required by §537.109. The service agreement also may speci-fy any other employment conditions the agency considers to be appropriate, including the employee’s (or job can-didate’s) position and the duties he or she is expected to perform, his or her work schedule, his or her level of per-formance, and the geographic location of his or her position. (See §§537.108 and 537.109.) The service agreement may ad-dress the possibility that, during the period the agreement is in effect, the agency may modify the agreement to provide student loan repayment bene-fits in addition to those fixed in the agreement based on contingencies or conditions specified in the agreement. (b) The minimum period of service to be established under a service agree-ment is 3 years, regardless of the amount of student loan repayment ben-efits authorized.

Periods of leave without pay, or other periods during which the em-ployee is not in a pay status, do not count toward completion of the re-quired service period. Thus, the service completion date must be extended by the total amount of time spent in non- pay status. However, as provided by 5 CFR 353.107, absence because of uni-formed service or compensable injury is considered creditable toward the re-quired service period upon reemploy-ment. (c) A service agreement made under this part in no way constitutes a prom-ise of, or right or entitlement to, ap-pointment, continued employment, or noncompetitive conversion to the com-petitive service. This condition should be stated in the service agreement. (d) The service period begins on the date specified in the service agreement. That beginning date may not be— (1) Earlier than the date the service agreement is signed; or (2) Earlier than the date the indi- vidual begins serving in the position for which he or she was recruited (when student loan repayment benefits are approved to recruit a job candidate to fill an agency position). (e) The service agreement must con- tain a provision addressing whether the individual would be required to reim-burse the paying agency for student loan repayment benefits if he or she voluntarily separates from the paying agency to work for another agency be-fore the end of the service period. (See §537.109(b)(2).) (f) The agency may include in a serv- ice agreement specific conditions (in addition to those required by law) that trigger the loss of eligibility for stu-dent loan repayment benefits and/or a requirement that the employee reim-burse the agency for student loan re-payment benefits already received. (See §§537.108(a)(3) and 537.109(a)(2).) However, a service agreement may not require reimbursement based on— (1) An employee’s failure to maintain performance at a particular level (un-less the employee is separated based on unacceptable performance); or (2) An involuntary separation for rea- sons other than misconduct, unaccept-able performance, or a negative suit-ability determination under 5 CFR part 731 (e.g., an involuntary separation re-sulting from a reduction in force or medical reasons). § 537.108 Loss of eligibility for student loan repayment benefits. (a) An employee receiving student loan repayment benefits from an agen-cy is ineligible for continued benefits from that agency if the employee— (1) Separates from the agency; (2) Does not maintain an acceptable level of performance, as determined under standards and procedures pre-scribed by the agency; or (3) Violates a condition in the service agreement, if the agreement specifi-cally provides that eligibility is lost when the condition is violated. (b) For the purpose of applying para- graph (a)(2) of this section, an accept-able level of performance is one that is equivalent to level 3 (‘‘Fully Success-ful’’ or equivalent) or higher, as de-scribed in 5 CFR 430.208(d). An em-ployee loses eligibility for student loan repayment benefits if his or her most recent official performance evaluation does not meet this requirement. § 537.109 Employee reimbursements to the Government. (a) An employee is indebted to the Federal Government and must reim-burse the paying agency for the amount of any student loan repayment benefits received under a service agree-ment if he or she— (1) Fails to complete the period of service required in the applicable serv-ice agreement (except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section); or (2)', 'rate for each appro-priated fund survey job having at least 10 unweighed matches and for each nonappropriated fund job having at least 5 unweighed matches. The weighted average rates shall be com-puted using the survey job data col-lected in accordance with §§532.235 and 532.247 and the establishment weight. (2)(i) Incentive and piece-work rates shall be excluded when computing weighted average rates if, after estab-lishment weights have been applied, 90 percent or more of the total usable wage survey data reflect rates paid on a straight-time basis only. (ii) When sufficient incentive and piece-work rate data are obtained, the full incentive rate shall be used in computing the job weighted average rate when it is equal to or less than the average nonincentive rate. If the full incentive rate is greater than the aver-age nonincentive rate, the incentive rate shall be discounted by 15 percent. The discounted incentive rate shall be compared with the guaranteed min-imum rate and the average nonincen-tive rate, and the highest rate shall be used in computing the job weighted av-erage rate. (b) The lead agency shall compute paylines using the weighted average rates computed under paragraph (a) of this section. (1) The lead agency shall compute unit and frequency paylines using the straight-line, least squares regression formula: Y = a + bx, where Y is the hourly rate, x is grade, a is the inter-cept of the payline with the Y-axis, and b is the slope of the payline. (i) The unit payline shall be com- puted using a weight of one for each of the usable survey jobs and the weight-ed average rates identified and com-puted under paragraph (a) of this sec-tion. (ii) The frequency payline shall be computed using a weight equal to the number of weighted matches for each of the usable survey jobs and the weighted average rates identified and computed under paragraph (a) of this section. (2) Either or both of the lines com- puted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be recomputed after eliminating survey job data that cause distortion in the lines. (3) The lead agency may compute midpoint paylines using the following formula: Y = (a u+ a f)/2 + ((b u+ b f)/2)x, where Y is the hourly rate, x is the grade, a uis the intercept of the unit payline, a fis the intercept of the fre- quency payline, b uis the slope of the unit payline, and b fis the slope of the frequency payline. A midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on all of the usable survey job data as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and a second midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on limited survey job data authorized in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (4) The lead agency may compute other paylines for the purpose of insti-tuting changes in the scope of the sur-vey. (c) Usable data obtained from a par- ticular establishment may not be modified or deleted in order to reduce the effect of an establishment’s rates on survey findings, i.e., data will not be deleted or modified to avoid establish-ment domination.

It focuses on a specific aspect of workforce management that is directly applicable to HR specialists, managers, and agency leadership. The question probes the criteria for offering relocation incentives, which is a practical concern for agencies struggling to attract or retain talent in competitive job markets.

The question demonstrates a substantive information need by seeking to understand the decision-making process behind relocation incentives. It requires a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations and workforce planning strategies. HR professionals would find this particularly useful for developing recruitment strategies, while managers would benefit from knowing the specific factors that justify such incentives.

The practical applicability is strong, as relocation incentives are an important tool for federal agencies to address skill gaps, recruit specialized talent, and manage workforce distribution. By exploring the factors that determine when a position is ""difficult to fill,"" the question gets to the heart of a complex human resources challenge in the federal employment context.

While not a top-tier 5-rating question (which would involve an even more critical or broadly applicable policy issue), this question is nonetheless a valuable inquiry into federal employment practices that would provide meaningful insights for multiple stakeholders in the federal workforce."

Subpart E—Extended Assignment Incentives SOURCE : 68 FR 53669, Sept. 12, 2003, unless otherwise noted. § 575.501 Purpose. This subpart contains OPM regula- tions implementing 5 U.S.C. 5757, which authorizes the payment of extended as- signment incentives. Subject to the re-quirements of this subpart, an agency may pay an extended assignment in-centive to eligible Federal employees assigned to positions located in a terri-tory or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands who agree to complete a specified additional period of employ-ment with the agency in that location. § 575.502 Definitions. In this subpart: Agency means an ‘‘Executive agen- cy,’’ as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. Authorized agency official means the head of an agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned. Employee means an employee of an agency who satisfies the definition of that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105. Involuntarily reassigned refers to a re- assignment initiated by an agency against an employee’s will and without he employee’s consent for reasons other than cause on charges of mis-conduct, delinquency, or inefficiency. Involuntarily separated refers to a sep- aration initiated by an agency against an employee’s will and without the em-ployee’s consent for reasons other than cause on charges of misconduct, delin-quency, or inefficiency. In addition, when an employee is separated because he or she declines to accept reassign-ment to another geographic area out-side one of the covered locations, the separation is involuntary if the em-ployee’s position description or other written agreement does not provide for such reassignment. However, an em-ployee’s separation is not involuntary if, after such a written mobility agree-ment is added, the employee accepts one reassignment outside his or her particular territory, possession, or commonwealth, but subsequently de-clines another reassignment. An em-ployee’s separation as a result of dis-ability retirement, a disability that prevents an employee from continuing Federal service or is the basis for sepa-ration by the agency as determined by acceptable medical evidence, or the death of an employee is considered to be an involuntary separation.

For example, a rate of basic pay may not include nonforeign area cost- of-living allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5941, night shift differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f), or environmental dif-ferentials under 5 U.S.C. 5343(c)(4). Service agreement means a written agreement between an agency and an employee under which the employee agrees to a specified period of employ-ment with the agency in a particular territory, possession, or common-wealth in return for payment of an ex-tended assignment incentive. Service period means an agreed-upon period of employment an employee is obligated to complete under a service agreement. Territory, possession, or commonwealth means a territory or a possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

(9) Prescribe criteria and procedures on how the agency will determine whether it has the resources available to convert a Pathways Participant to a term or permanent position in the competitive service. These procedures must specify the timeline for making the determination, which must include informing the Pathways Participant no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of the appointment about whether the agency is able to convert them. If an agency is unable to convert a Path-ways Participant, its procedures may include the actions it will take to as-sist a Participant in pursuing conver-sion at another agency (when appro-priate). (10) Identify the minimum service- hour requirement that must be com-pleted by an Intern as required by §362.204. (11) An agency’s Pathways Policy must be maintained and be available for review upon request of OPM, appli-cants, Pathways Programs partici-pants, or agency employees. (b) Implementation of Pathways Policy requirement. Agencies must establish a Pathways Policy that meets the cri-teria listed in paragraph (a) of this sec-tion not later than December 9, 2024. Upon June 11, 2024, agencies with exist-ing Pathways memorandums of under-standing (MOUs) may continue to use the Pathways Programs subject to the regulations in this part in lieu of an updated Pathways Policy while they are developing and updating their poli-cies in accordance with the regulations in this part. Agencies without an exist-ing MOU or an expired MOU on June 11, 2024, must establish an agency Path-ways Policy before they begin making Pathways appointments. Agencies with MOUs that expire within 240 days of April 12, 2024, may request an extension of the MOU. All Pathways Programs MOUs will expire on December 9, 2024, unless OPM has specifically approved use of the MOU after December 9, 2024. (c) Revocation. The Director may re- voke an agency’s authority to make Pathways appointments when agency use of these Programs is inconsistent with E.O. 13562, this part, or the agen-cy’s Pathways Policies. [89 FR 25770, Apr. 12, 2024] § 362.105 Filling positions. (a) Workforce Planning. Before filling any positions under these Programs, agencies should include measures in their workforce planning to ensure that an adequate number of permanent positions will be available to convert Pathways Participants who success-fully complete their Programs. (b) Announcements. When an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce, it must pro-vide OPM information concerning Pathways Programs job opportunities as provided in each Pathways Program. For the purposes of this paragraph, ‘‘agency’’ means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 and the Gov-ernment Printing Office.

(a) Agencies must follow the Federal procurement laws and the Federal Ac-quisition Regulation, as applicable, in procuring services from the private sector. (b) Agencies should make full use of the provisions of the Federal procure-ment system to make clear that the firm is the legally responsible em-ployer and to specify the obligations the firm will have to meet to provide effective performance including such matters as the types and levels of skills to be provided, deadlines for pro-viding service, liability insurance, and, when necessary, security requirements.

The Pathways Program is a key recruitment and development initiative for federal agencies, and the question focuses on the important process of converting temporary or developmental program participants to permanent positions. 

This question would be extremely useful for:
- HR specialists responsible for implementing Pathways Program policies
- Managers involved in talent development and workforce planning
- Current Pathways participants seeking to understand their potential career progression
- Agency leadership interested in strategic talent management

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment regulations by focusing on the policy considerations surrounding participant conversion. It requires a nuanced exploration of the legal and procedural requirements that govern how agencies transition promising talent from temporary to permanent status.

Key areas of consideration likely include:
- Eligibility criteria for conversion
- Performance evaluation requirements
- Competitive vs. non-competitive conversion processes
- Documentation and procedural compliance
- Career development implications

The question is practical, directly applicable to federal employment contexts, and addresses a substantive policy issue that has real-world implications for both employees and agencies. It reflects a deep engagement with the complexities of federal workforce management under Title 5 regulations."
" What percentage of details to private sector organizations must agencies target for small business concerns, and how is this percentage calculated?
"," According to §370.107, agencies must ensure that at least 20 percent of details made to private sector organizations in each calendar year are to small business concerns. When calculating this percentage, agencies must round up to the nearest whole number. For example, if an agency detailed 11 individuals to private sector organizations during a year, they must have made at least 3 details to small business concerns (rounded up from 2.2). An agency that makes fewer than five details in a year is exempt from this requirement.","['of his or her detail; (3) May not have access to any trade secrets or to any other nonpublic infor-mation which is of commercial value to the private sector organization from which he or she is detailed; (4) Is subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe; and (5) Is covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, Compensation for Work Injuries, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 3704(c).

(d) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 3704(d), a private sector organization may not charge the Federal Government, as di-rect or indirect costs under a Federal contract, for the costs of pay or bene-fits paid by that private sector organi-zation to an employee detailed to an agency under this part. (e) Details may be terminated by the agency (agency head or designee) or private sector organization concerned for any reason at any time. § 370.107 Details to small business con- cerns. (a) The head of each agency must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, of the details made to private sector organizations in each calendar year, at least 20 percent are to small business concerns, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(1). (b) Agencies must round up to the nearest whole number when calcu-lating the percentage of details to small business concerns needed to meet the requirements of this section. For example, if an agency detailed 11 indi-viduals to private sector organizations during a given year, to meet the 20 per-cent requirement, that agency must have made at least 3 (rounded up from 2.2) of these details to small business concerns. (c) For purposes of this section, ‘‘year’’ refers to the 12-month period beginning on date of the enactment of the Act, December 17, 2002, and each succeeding 12-month period in which any assignments are made. Assign-ments ‘‘made’’ in a year are those com-mencing in such year, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(2). (d) Agencies that do not meet the re- quirements of this section are subject to the reporting requirements in 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(3). (e) An agency that makes fewer than five details to private sector organiza-tions in any year is not subject to this section. § 370.108 Reporting requirements. (a) Agencies using this part must pre- pare and submit to OPM semiannual reports in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3706 which must include: (1) The total number of individuals detailed to, and the total number of in-dividuals detailed from, the agency during the report period; (2) A brief description of each detail reported under paragraph (a)(1) of this section including: (i) The name of the detailed indi- vidual, and the private sector organiza-tion and the agency (including the spe-cific bureau or other agency compo-nent) to or from which such individual was detailed; (ii) The respective positions to and from which the individual was detailed, including the duties and responsibil-ities and the pay grade or level associ-ated with each; and (iii) The duration and objectives of the individual’s detail; and (3) Such other information as OPM considers appropriate. (b) Reports are due to OPM no later than April 7 and October 7 of each year for the immediately preceding 6-month periods ending March 31 and September 30, respectively. (c) Agencies that do not meet the re- quirements of §370.107 must prepare and submit annual reports to Congress in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(3), as appropriate. § 370.109 Agency plans. Before detailing agency employees or receiving private sector employees under this part, an agency must estab-lish an Information Technology Ex-change Program Plan. The plan must include, but is not limited to, the fol-lowing elements: (a) Designation of the agency offi- cials with authority to review and ap-prove details; (b) Estimated number of candidates needed, both private sector and Federal employees, to address IT workforce needs within the agency; (c) Criteria for the selection of agen- cy employees for a detail under this part.

(a) An authorized agency official must establish the criteria for deter-mining the amount of a relocation in-centive. An agency may pay a reloca-tion incentive— (1) As an initial lump-sum payment at the commencement of the service period required by the service agree-ment; (2) In installments throughout the service period required by the service agreement; (3) As a final lump-sum payment upon the completion of the full service period required by the service agree-ment; or (4) In a combination of these pay- ment methods. (b)(1) Except as provided in para- graph (c) of this section, the total amount of relocation incentive pay-ments paid to an employee in a service period may not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the em-ployee at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including fractions of a year) in the service period (not to exceed 4 years). (2) For hourly rate employees who do not have a scheduled annual rate of basic pay, compute the annual rate re-quired for paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion by multiplying the applicable hourly rate in effect at the beginning of the service period by 2,087 hours. (3) For the purpose of determining the number of years in a service period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, divide the total number of calendar days in the service period (as estab-lished under §575.208) by 365 and round the result to two decimal places. For example, a service period covering 39 biweekly pay periods equals 546 days, and 546 days divided by 365 days equals 1.50 years. (c)(1) An authorized agency official may request that OPM waive the limi-tation in paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion for an employee based on a critical agency need. The authorized agency of-ficial must determine that the com-petencies required for the position are critical to the successful accomplish-ment of an important agency mission, project, or initiative (e.g., programs or projects related to a national emer-gency or implementing a new law or critical management initiative). Under such a waiver, the total amount of re-location incentive payments paid to an employee in a service period may not exceed 50 percent of the annual rate of VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00749 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR740 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 575.210 basic pay of the employee at the begin- ning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including frac-tions of a year) in the service period. However, in no event may a waiver pro-vide total relocation incentive pay-ments exceeding 100 percent of the em-ployee’s annual rate of basic pay at the beginning of the service period. (2) Waiver requests must include— (i) A description of the critical agen- cy need the proposed relocation incen-tive would address; (ii) The documentation required by §575.208; (iii) The proposed relocation incen- tive payment amount and a justifica-tion for that amount; (iv) The timing and method for mak- ing the relocation incentive payments; (v) The period of service required; and (vi) Any other information pertinent to the case at hand. (d) A relocation incentive is not part of an employee’s rate of basic pay for any purpose. (e) Payment of a relocation incentive is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. § 575.210 Service agreement require- ments. (a) Before paying a relocation incen- tive, an agency must require the em-ployee to sign a written service agree-ment to complete a specified period of employment with the agency (or suc-cessor agency in the event of a transfer of function) at the new duty station. An authorized agency official must es-tablish the criteria for determining the length of a service period. The service period may not exceed 4 years. (b)(1) The service agreement must in- clude the commencement and termi-nation dates of the required service pe-riod. Except as provided under para-graphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the required service period must begin upon the commencement of service at the new duty station. The service pe-riod must terminate on the last day of a pay period. (2) If service at the new duty station does not begin on the first day of a pay period, the agency must delay the serv-ice period commencement date so that a required service period begins on the first day of the first pay period begin- ning on or after the commencement of service at the new duty station. (3) An agency may delay a service agreement commencement date until after the employee completes an initial period of formal training when contin- ued employment in the position is con-tingent on successful completion of the formal training. The agency must make the determination to pay a relo-cation incentive before the employee enters on duty in the position, as re-quired by §575.208(a)(3). However, the service agreement must specify that if an employee does not successfully com-plete the training before the service pe-riod commences, the agency is not ob-ligated to pay any portion of the relo-cation incentive to the employee. (c) The service agreement must specify the total amount of the incen-tive, the method of paying the incen-tive, and the timing and amount of each incentive payment, as established under §575.209. (d) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency must terminate the service agreement ( i.e., if an employee is de- moted or separated for cause, receives a rating of record of less than ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equivalent, fails to maintain residency in the new geo-graphic area for the duration of the service agreement, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agree-ment) and the conditions under which the employee must repay a relocation incentive under §575.211. An agency must define the limits of the new geo-graphic area in the service agreement for the purpose of determining whether an employee maintains residency in that geographic area for the duration of the service agreement. (e) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency may terminate the service agreement before the employee com-pletes the agreed-upon service period. The service agreement must specify the effect of the termination under §575.211, including the conditions under which the agency will pay an addi-tional relocation incentive payment for partially completed service under §575.211(e) and (f).

(d) An employee covered by a special rate schedule is not entitled to a spe-cial rate for any purpose with respect to any period during which the em-ployee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other legal author-ity.

(a) OPM may increase the minimum rates of pay otherwise payable to a cat-egory of employees in one or more areas or locations, grades or levels, oc-cupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, when it is nec-essary to address existing or likely sig-nificant recruitment or retention dif-ficulties. OPM will consider the cir-cumstances listed in paragraph (b) of this section and the factors listed in §530.306 when evaluating the need for special rates. When OPM establishes a minimum special rate under this au-thority, corresponding increases also may be made in one or more of the re-maining rates of the affected grade or level. For any given grade, a minimum special rate may not exceed the max-imum rate of basic pay for the rate range (excluding any locality rate, other special rate, or similar payment under other legal authority) by more than 30 percent. A special rate may not exceed the rate for level IV of the Ex-ecutive Schedule. (b) The circumstances considered by OPM in evaluating the need for special rates are the following: (1) Rates of pay offered by non-Fed- eral employers which are significantly higher than those payable by the Gov-ernment within the area, location, oc-cupational group, or other category of positions under GS pay system; (2) The remoteness of the area or lo- cation involved; (3) The undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational haz-ards); (4) Locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for the area involved; (5) A nonforeign area cost-of-living allowance authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1) for the area involved; or (6) Any other circumstances OPM considers appropriate. (c) In setting the level of special rates within a rate range for a category of employees, OPM will compute the special rate supplement by adding a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percent-age to all GS rates within that range, except that an alternate method may be used— (1) For grades GS–1 and GS–2, where within-grade increases vary through-out the range; and (2) In the nonforeign areas listed in 5 CFR 591.205 for special rate schedules established before January 1, 2012. (d) If OPM establishes a special rate schedule that covers only law enforce-ment officers, OPM may compute the special rate supplement for grades GS– 3 through 10 as a fixed percentage of LEO special base rates instead of GS rates. With respect to such a schedule, references to GS rates in §530.307 are deemed to be references to LEO special base rates. (e) Using its authority in section 1918(a)(1) of the Non-Foreign Area Re-tirement Equity Assurance Act of 2009 in combination with its authority under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may establish a separate special rate schedule for a category of employees who are in GS positions covered by a nonforeign area special rate schedule in effect on Janu-ary 1, 2012, and who are employed in a nonforeign area before an OPM-speci-fied effective date. Such a separate schedule may be established if the ex-isting special rate schedule is being re-duced. An employee’s coverage under the separate special rate schedule is contingent on the employee being con-tinuously employed in a covered GS po-sition in the nonforeign area after the OPM-specified effective date. Such a separate special rate schedule must be designed to provide temporary pay pro-tection and be phased out over time until all affected employees are cov-ered under the pay schedule that would otherwise apply to the category of em-ployees in question.

The request must include a certifi-cation by the authorized agency offi-cial that the requested special rates are necessary to ensure adequate staff-ing levels to accomplish the agency’s mission. (b) The authorized agency official is responsible for submitting complete supporting data for any request for new or higher special rates. OPM may re-quire that the supporting data include a survey of prevailing non-Federal pay rates in the relevant labor market. (c) OPM may coordinate an agency special rate request with other agen-cies that have similar categories of em-ployees. OPM may designate a lead agency to assist in coordinating the collection of relevant data. Each af-fected agency is responsible for submit-ting complete supporting data upon re-quest to OPM or the lead agency, as ap-propriate, unless the agency deter-mines that a category of its employees will not be covered by the proposed special rate schedule, as provided in §530.303(c). § 530.306 Evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates. (a) In evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates, OPM may consider the following factors: (1) The number of existing vacant po- sitions and the length of time they have been vacant; (2) The number of employees who have quit ( i.e., voluntarily left Federal service), including, when available, a subcount of the number of employees who quit to take a comparable position offering higher pay; (3) Evidence to support a conclusion that recruitment or retention problems likely will develop (if such problems do not already exist) or will worsen; (4) The number of vacancies an agen- cy tried to fill, compared to the num-ber of hires and offers made; (5) The nature of the existing labor market; (6) The degree to which an agency has considered and used other', 'the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of inves-tigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a signifi-cant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed. (b) Although not exhaustive, the fol- lowing factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the author-ity head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct ( i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint; (1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements; (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made; (3) The degree of the defendant’s cul- pability with respect to the mis-conduct; (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR61 Office of Personnel Management § 185.134 (5) The value of the Government’s ac- tual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation; (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government’s loss; (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government pro-grams and operations; (8) Whether the defendant has en- gaged in a pattern of the same or simi-lar misconduct; (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct; (10) The degree to which the defend- ant has involved others in the mis-conduct or in concealing it; (11) Where the misconduct of employ- ees or agents is imputed to the defend-ant, the extent to which the defend-ant’s practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct; (12) Whether the defendant cooper- ated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct; (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers; (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant’s sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the de-fendant’s prior participation in the program or in similar transactions; (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or admin-istrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, di-rectly or indirectly; (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and (17) The potential impact of the mis- conduct on the rights of others.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by wit- nesses under oath or affirmation. (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, tes- timony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be pro-vided to all others parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in §185.123(a). (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of in-terrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to— (1) Make the interrogation and pres- entation effective for the ascertain-ment of the truth, (2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) Protect witnesses from harass- ment or undue embarrassment. (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true dis-closure of the facts. (e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on mat-ters relevant to the proceedings with-out regard to the scope of his or her di-rect examination. To the extent per-mitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an ad-verse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.

It demonstrates a practical information need for federal procurement officers, contracting specialists, and small business liaisons who must understand and implement small business contracting requirements.

The question is technically precise and seeks specific, actionable information about:
1. Small business contracting percentages
2. Calculation methodology for these targets

While the question is somewhat technical, it represents a genuine need for understanding federal procurement policies that impact how agencies allocate contracts. This information is crucial for:
- Ensuring compliance with small business development regulations
- Supporting economic opportunities for small businesses
- Guiding procurement strategy in federal agencies

The practicality is high because it directly relates to a key aspect of federal procurement policy that affects multiple stakeholders, including small business owners, federal procurement professionals, and agency leadership responsible for meeting contracting diversity goals.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it's somewhat narrowly focused on a specific procurement policy aspect, rather than having broader applicability across all federal employment contexts."
" What reinstatement rights does an employee have when returning from a position under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961?
"," According to §352.504, an employee appointed under sections 233(d) or 625(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act is entitled to be reinstated in their former position or a position of like seniority, status, and pay in the same agency upon termination of their appointment (for reasons other than misconduct). For Senior Executive Service (SES) employees, reinstatement can be to any SES position for which they are qualified, at not less than their previous SES pay rate.

Collections may be made under procedures which may be determined in accordance with written agreements reached between accounting represent-atives of OPM and the agency. (3) All retirement and insurance ben- efits and obligations shall be computed in the same manner as if the rate of basic pay the officer was receiving on the last day he was in his Federal posi-tion before employment with the agen-cy had continued without change. (4) An officer not covered by either subchapter III of chapter 83, or chapter 87, of title 5, United States Code, in the Federal position which he last held or from which he separates to enter em-ployment with the agency does not ac-quire coverage or benefits under these statutes based on employment with the agency. (b) Death coverage. An officer who dies during his term of employment or within 90 days of his separation there-from is deemed to have died in the Fed-eral Service. § 352.405 Resumption of Federal serv- ice. (a) Pay increase. Except for an em- ployee whose right is to a position in the Senior Executive Service (SES), an officer who is reemployed in the Fed- eral position which he or she left or one of like seniority, status, and pay within 90 days of his or her separation from the agency following a term of employment, is entitled to the rate of basic pay to which he/she would have been entitled had he or she remained in the Federal service. When the employ-ee’s right is to a position in the SES, this subpart authorizes reemployment to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified at not less than the SES rate of basic pay as de-termined under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D at which the employee was being paid immediately before his or her transfer. (b) Sick leave account. An officer shall have any sick leave account which he may have had in his last Federal posi-tion reestablished for credit or charge, if he returns to an appropriate leave system within 52 calendar weeks after the date he is separated from his term of employment with the agency. (c) Service credit for agency employ- ment. An officer who is reemployed in the Federal service within 90 days after completion of his term of employment with the agency is entitled to credit as Federal service for his term of employ-ment with the agency. However, OPM shall give service credit for subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, purposes only if the offi-cer complies with the requirements of §352.404(a)(1).

An em- ployee who separated because of a com- pensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consider-ation, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equiva-lent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency’s reem-ployment priority list for the competi-tive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former com-muting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equiva-lent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an in-jured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and sub-sequently fully recovers.

This right is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the individual is entitled to the rights ac-corded individuals who fully or par-tially recover, as applicable. (d) Partially recovered. Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an indi-vidual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recov-ered employee is expected to seek re-employment as soon as he or she is able. § 353.302 Retention protections. An injured employee enjoys no spe- cial protection in a reduction in force. Separation by reduction in force or for cause while on compensation means the individual has no restoration rights. § 353.303 Restoration rights of TAPER employees. An employee serving in the competi- tive service under a temporary ap-pointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER) under §316.201 of this chapter (other than an employee serv-ing in a position classified above GS– 15), is entitled to be restored to the po-sition he or she left or an equivalent one in the same commuting area. § 353.304 Appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (includ-ing the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) may appeal to the MSPB an agency’s failure to re-store, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB’s regulations. (b) An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for ex-cepted and competitive service employ-ees, respectively. (c) An individual who is partially re- covered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determina-tion of whether the agency is acting ar-bitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency’s failure to credit time spent on compensation for pur-poses of rights and benefits based upon length of service.

(4) The substitution of overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty for obligated overtime hours not worked is solely for pay computation purposes. The substitution does not change the hours of an agent’s regular tour of duty. The hours that are sub-stituted are considered to have been performed when they were worked, not during the obligated overtime hours for which they are substituted. (c) Application of compensatory time off or future overtime work to offset overtime hours debt. (1) If a Border Patrol agent does not have sufficient additional work in a pay period to substitute for all periods of absence during obligated overtime hours within the agent’s reg-ular tour of duty for that pay period, any unused balance of compensatory time off hours previously earned under §550.1625 must be applied towards the newly accrued overtime hours debt. (2) If an agent has a remaining over- time hours debt after applying para-graphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, any additional overtime work outside the agent’s regular tour of duty in subse-quent pay periods that would otherwise be credited under §550.1624 or §550.1625 must be applied towards the overtime hours debt until that debt is satisfied. The application of such hours must be done in the following priority order: first, irregular overtime hours; and sec-ond, regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty. Any overtime hour applied under this paragraph (c)(2) may not be considered an overtime hour of work for any other purpose. (d) Unsatisfied overtime hours debt at movement to a non-agent position or sepa-ration. (1) Any unsatisfied overtime hours debt that exists at the time of movement to a non-agent position or separation from Federal service must be recovered to the extent possible by offsetting the affected employee’s posi-tive balance (if any) of annual leave, time-off awards, or compensatory time off for travel. In cases where the offset will totally eliminate the debt, an agent’s balances must be applied in the following order: first, the balance of annual leave; second, the balance of time-off awards; and third, the balance of compensatory time off for travel. (2) Any unsatisfied overtime hours debt that exists at the time of move-ment to a non-agent position or separa-tion from Federal service after apply-ing paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be converted to a monetary debt equal to the result of multiplying the agent’s hourly rate of basic pay at the time of movement to a non-agent posi-tion or separation by the number of hours in the overtime hours debt. CBP must follow standard debt collection procedures to recover any debt. R ELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROVISIONS § 550.1631 Other types of premium pay.

(For an agent, pay for over-time work on a Sunday or holiday is determined under 5 U.S.C. 5542(g), not under section 5546(d).) The agent’s rate of basic pay (without any overtime supplement) must be used in com-puting such premium payments. (c) An agent may not be paid standby duty premium pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) or administratively uncon-trollable overtime pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(2). § 550.1632 Hazardous duty pay.

It demonstrates a specific information need that would be particularly valuable for:

1. Federal employees who have served overseas under the Foreign Assistance Act
2. HR specialists managing complex reinstatement processes
3. Managers dealing with employee transitions between federal positions
4. Legal and compliance professionals interpreting employee protection regulations

The question touches on an important but potentially complex area of federal employment law that isn't immediately obvious to most employees. Reinstatement rights are critical for protecting an employee's career trajectory when they temporarily leave their federal position for specific international assignments. While not a universally applicable question, it represents a sophisticated and meaningful inquiry about federal employment protections that could have significant practical implications for the individuals involved.

The specificity of the question suggests a real-world scenario where an employee needs clear guidance about their rights and potential job security after serving in an international capacity. This makes it a valuable question for those navigating the intricacies of federal employment regulations."
 What are the key considerations for determining the amount allowable in settlement of a property damage or loss claim?," According to §180.108(i), the amount allowable in settlement depends on two primary factors:
1. If the property is damaged beyond economical repair or lost, the settlement is the depreciated value immediately prior to damage/loss, less any salvage value.
2. If the property is economically repairable, the settlement is the reasonable cost of repairs, provided that the repair cost does not exceed the depreciated value of the property.","['aged or lost property may be made in kind whenever appropriate. (i) Amount allowable. Subject to the limitations of §§180.108(c) through 180.108(h), the amount allowable in set-tlement of a claim is either: (1) The depreciated value imme- diately prior to damage or loss of prop-erty damaged beyond economical re-pair or lost, less any salvage value; or (2) The reasonable cost of repairs when property is economically repair-able, provided that the cost of repairs does not exceed the depreciated value. (j) Notification. The approving author- ity shall notify the claimant in writing of the action taken on the claim and, if the claim is disapproved or only par-tially approved, the reasons therefor.

However, the usefulness is somewhat limited. While it could be relevant to federal employees dealing with property damage claims, the question is somewhat vague and lacks specificity. 

The practicality is moderate - property damage claims can occur in federal employment contexts, such as during official travel or while performing job duties. HR specialists and claims administrators might find this question useful for understanding settlement procedures. However, the broad nature of the question suggests it might require more detailed follow-up to be truly actionable.

The information need is present but not strongly defined. A more specific question about the exact process, documentation requirements, or specific guidelines for property damage claims would be more valuable. As it stands, the question provides a general prompt for exploring settlement considerations without diving into the specific regulatory nuances.

The applicability is moderate, as it could help federal employees understand their rights and potential compensation in property damage scenarios, but lacks the precision to be immediately useful for decision-making or compliance purposes."
 What criteria must an agency consider when placing an employee on investigative leave?," According to § 630.1503(e), when determining whether to place an employee on investigative leave, an agency must consider three baseline factors:
1. The nature and severity of the employee's exhibited or alleged behavior
2. The nature of the agency's or employee's work and the ability to accomplish its mission
3. Other impacts of the employee's continued workplace presence, including potential risks to:
- Life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors, or visitors
- Government physical assets or information systems
- Personal property
- Records (classified, privileged, proprietary, financial, medical)
- Privacy of individuals whose data the government holds","['PO 00000 Frm 00532 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR523 Office of Personnel Management § 532.313 2022 NAICS codes 2022 NAICS industry titles 517121 ............................

When ir-regular or occasional overtime work is performed in other than the full frac-tion, odd minutes shall be rounded up or rounded down to the nearest full fraction of an hour used to credit over-time work. (b) Time spent in preshift or postshift activities. A preshift activity is a pre- paratory activity that an employee performs prior to the commencement of his or her principal activities, and a postshift activity is a concluding activ-ity that an employee performs after the completion of his or her principal activities. Such activities are not prin-cipal activities as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. (1) (i) If the head of a department rea- sonably determines that a preshift or VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00612 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR603 Office of Personnel Management § 550.112 postshift activity is closely related to an employee’s principal activities, and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and that the total time spent in that activity is more than 10 minutes per daily tour of duty, he or she shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the 10 minutes, as hours of work. (ii) If the time spent in a preshift or postshift activity is compensable as hours of work, the head of the depart-ment shall schedule the time period for the employee to perform that activity. An employee shall be credited with the actual time spent in that activity dur-ing the time period scheduled by the head of the department. In no case shall the time credited for the perform-ance of an activity exceed the time scheduled by the head of the depart-ment. If the time period scheduled by the head of the department for the per-formance of a pereshift or postshift ac-tivity is outside the employee’s daily tour of duty, the employee shall be credited with the time spent per-forming that activity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (2) A preshift or postshift activity that is not closely related to the per-formance of the principal activities is considered a preliminary or postliminary activity. Time spent in preliminary or postliminary activities is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable, even if it occurs be-tween periods of activity that are com-pensable as hours of work. (c) Leave with pay. An employee’s ab- sence from duty on authorized leave with pay under subchapter I of chapter 61 of title 5, United States Code, during the time when he would otherwise have been required to be on duty during a basic workweek (including authorized absence on a legal holiday, on a non-workday established by Executive or administrative order, and on compen-satory time off as provided in §550.114) is deemed employment and does not re-duce the amount of overtime pay to which the employee is entitled during an administrative workweek. Leave of absence with pay under subchapter I of chapter 61 of title 5, United States Code, is charged only for an absence that occurs during a basic workweek. (d) Leave without pay. (1) For a period of leave without pay in an employee’s basic workweek, an equal period of service performed outside the basic workweek, but in the same administra-tive workweek, shall be substituted and paid for at the rate applicable to his basic workweek before any remain-ing period of service may be paid for at the overtime rate on the basis of ex-ceeding 40 hours in a workweek. (2) For a period of leave without pay in an employee’s daily tour of duty, an equal period of service performed out-side the daily tour, but in the same workday, shall be substituted and paid for at the rate applicable to his daily tour of duty before any remaining pe-riod of service may be paid for at the overtime rate on the basis of exceeding 8 hours in a workday. (e) Absence during overtime periods. Except as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, as expressly authorized by statute, or to the extent authorized while the employee is in a travel sta-tus, a period is counted as overtime work only when the employee actually performs work during the period or is taking compensatory time off as pro-vided in §550.114. (f) Night, Sunday, or holiday work. Hours of night, Sunday, or holiday work are included in determining for overtime pay purposes the total num-ber of hours of work in an administra-tive workweek. (g) Time in travel status. Time in trav- el status away from the official duty- station of an employee is deemed em-ployment only when: (1) It is within his regularly sched- uled administrative workweek, includ-ing regular overtime work; or (2) The travel— (i) Involves the performance of actual work while traveling; (ii) Is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while trav-eling; (iii) Is carried out under such ardu- ous and unusual conditions that the travel is inseparable from work; or (iv) Results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively, including travel by an employee to such an event and the return of the employee to his or her of-ficial-duty station.

Irregular or occasional overtime work performed by an employee on a day when work was not scheduled for him, or for which he is required to return to his place of employment, is deemed at least 2 hours in duration for the purpose of premium pay, either in money or compensatory time off. (i) Periods of duty that are com- pensated by annual premium pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c) (1) or (2) shall not be credited for the purpose of determining hours of work in excess of 8 hours in a day. (j) Official duty station. An agency may prescribe a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine whether an employee’s travel is within or outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station for determining entitlement to overtime pay for travel under paragraph (g) of this section ex-cept that— (1) An agency’s definition of an em- ployee’s official duty station for deter-mining overtime pay for travel may not be smaller than the definition of ‘‘official station and post of duty’’ under the Federal Travel Regulation issued by the General Services Admin-istration (41 CFR 300–3.1); and (2) Travel from home to work and vice versa is not', 'or more of the subordinates would, in the absence of such a dif-ferential, be more than the continuing pay (as determined under §575.405(c) of this part) of the supervisor.

In this subpart: Agency has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5102. Continuing pay means the aggregate of all continuing payments and annual premium pay received by an employee at any one time. Continuing payment means basic pay and any other form of pay that is paid in the same manner and at the same time as basic pay— i.e., for periods dur- ing which an employee receives basic pay. Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5102. Head of agency means the head of an agency or an official who has been del-egated the authority to act for the head of the agency in the matter con-cerned. Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position to which the em-ployee is or will be appointed before de-ductions and including any special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; local-ity-based comparability payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority, but excluding additional pay of any other kind. For example, rate of basic pay excludes a night differential under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f), an environment differential under 5 U.S.C. 5343(c)(4), or a similar payment under other legal authority. Supervisor has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10).

(3) Each determination to pay a su- pervisory differential shall be docu-mented. § 575.405 Calculation and payment of supervisory differential. (a) A supervisory differential shall be calculated as a percentage of the super-visor’s rate of basic pay or as a dollar amount and shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the su-pervisor’s basic pay— i.e., the differen- tial shall be paid at an hourly rate for each hour during which the supervisor receives basic pay. (b) The amount of a supervisory dif- ferential shall not cause the super-visor’s continuing pay, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, to exceed the continuing pay of the high-est paid subordinate not under the General Schedule, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, by more than 3 percent. (c) For purposes of comparing the continuing pay of a supervisor whose position is under the General Schedule with the continuing pay of a subordi-nate whose position is not under the General Schedule, the following pay-ments shall be included in determining the amount of continuing pay received by the supervisor: (1) Basic pay, including a retained rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5363 and part 536 of this chapter or other similar au-thority: (2) Any other continuing payment, except night, Sunday, or holiday pre-mium pay or a hazardous duty differen-tial under chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code; (3) Premium pay paid on an annual basis under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c); and (4) Any other continuing payment, except night, Sunday, or holiday pre-mium pay or hazardous duty pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V; re-cruitment or relocation incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5753; retention incen-tives under 5 U.S.C. 5754; or similar payments under other legal authority. (d) For purposes of comparing the continuing pay of a supervisor whose position is under the General Schedule with the continuing pay of a subordi-nate whose position is not under the General Schedule, the following pay-ments shall be included in determining the amount of continuing pay received by the subordinate: (1) Basic pay, excluding a night or en- vironmental differential under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f) or 5343(c)(4), respectively, or similar payment under other legal au-thority; (2) Any other continuing payment, except Sunday or holiday pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V; re-cruitment or relocation incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5753; retention incen-tives under 5 U.S.C. 5754; or similar payments under other legal authority; and (3) Premium pay paid on an annual basis under an authority similar to 5 U.S.C. 5545(c). (e) For the purpose of making any of the comparisons required by this sub-part, continuing pay shall be cal-culated on an annual basis for both the supervisor and the subordinate. (f) Payment of a supervisory differen- tial is subject to the aggregate limita-tion on pay under 5 U.S.C. 5307 and sub-part B of part 530 of this chapter.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an employee is considered to be eligible to telework if the agency determines the employee is eligible to telework under agency telework poli-cies described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(a) and is not barred from teleworking under the eligibility conditions described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(4). Any telework agree-ment established under 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(2) must be superseded as nec-essary to comply with an agency’s ac-tion to require telework under 5 U.S.C. 6502(c) and paragraph (c)(1) of this sec-tion. (3) If an employee who is required to telework under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is absent from telework duty without the required approval, an agency may place the employee in ab-sent without leave status, consistent with agency policies. (4) The agency decision to require telework under this paragraph (c), as well as the supporting agency deter-minations and any conditions or re-quirements governing the required telework ( e.g., the telework assign- ment’s duration or location), are to be put into effect at the agency’s discre-tion, subject to the requirements of this paragraph (c). (5) If an agency requires telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave, the agency must provide the em-ployee with a written explanation re-garding the required telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave. The written explanation must include the following: (i) The agency’s determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and, (ii) A description of the limitations of the required telework, including the expected duration of telework. (d) Reassessment and return to duty. (1) An employee may be returned to duty at any time if the agency reassesses its determination to place the employee on investigative leave or notice leave. An employee on investigative leave or notice leave must be prepared to report promptly to work as provided in para-graph (d)(4) of this section. These deci-sions are at the discretion of the agen-cy. (2) For an employee on investigative leave, an agency may reassess its de-termination that the employee must be removed from the workplace based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its deter-mination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appro-priate. An agency may reassess its pre-vious determination to require or not require telework under paragraph (c) of this section. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency. (3) For an employee on notice leave, an agency may reassess its determina-tion that the employee must be re-moved from the regular worksite based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its deter-mination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appro-priate. These decisions are at the dis-cretion of the agency. (4) When an employee is placed on in- vestigative leave or notice leave, the employee must be available to report promptly at a time during the employ-ee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty and to an approved duty location, if di-rected by the employee’s agency. Any failure to so report may result in the employee being recorded as absent without leave, which can be the basis for disciplinary action. An employee who anticipates being unavailable to report promptly must request leave or paid time off in advance, as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this sec-tion, to avoid being recorded as absent without leave.

In making a de- termination regarding the criteria list-ed under paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion, an agency must consider the fol-lowing baseline factors: (1) The nature and severity of the employee’s exhibited or alleged behav-ior; (2) The nature of the agency’s or em- ployee’s work and the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission; and (3) Other impacts of the employee’s continued presence in the workplace detrimental to legitimate Government interests, including whether the em-ployee poses an unacceptable risk to— (i) The life, safety, or health of em- ployees, contractors, vendors or visi-tors to a Federal facility; (ii) The Government’s physical assets or information systems; (iii) Personal property; (iv) Records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, financial or medical records; or (v) The privacy of the individuals whose data the Government holds in its systems. (f) Minimum charge. An agency must use the same minimum charge incre-ments for investigative leave and no-tice leave as it does for annual and sick leave under §630.206. (g) Tour of duty. Employees may be granted investigative leave or notice leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charg-ing annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work re-quirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work sched-ule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under §630.210. § 630.1504 Administration of investiga- tive leave.

When fewer than three candidates re-main in the highest category, consider-ation may be expanded to include the next category. When making an ap-pointment from a list on which can-didates have received numerical scores, the agency must make its selection for each vacancy from not more than the highest three names available for ap-pointment in the order provided in §302.304. Under either method, an agen-cy is not required to— (1) Accord an applicant on its pri- ority reemployment or reemployment list the preference consideration re-quired by §302.304 if the list on which the applicant’s name appears does not contain the names of at least three preference eligibles; or (2) Consider an applicant who has previously been considered three times or a preference eligible if consideration of his/her name has been discontinued for the position as provided in para-graph (b) of this section. (b) Passing over a preference applicant. When an agency, in making an appoint-ment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, passes over the name of a preference eligible, it shall follow the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 3318(c) and 3319(c) as described in the Delegated Ex- amining Operations Handbook. An agen- cy may discontinue consideration of the name of a preference eligible for a position as described in 5 U.S.C. 3318(c). [55 FR 9407, Mar. 14, 1990, as amended at 85 FR 63191, Oct. 7, 2020] § 302.402 Reappointment. An agency may reappoint a current or former nontemporary employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government who is a preference eligi-ble to a position covered by this part without regard to the names of quali-fied applicants on the agency’s priority reemployment, reemployment, or reg-ular employment list. § 302.403 Qualifications for promotion. In determining qualifications for pro- motion with respect to an employee who is a preference eligible, an agency shall waive: (a) Requirements as to age, height, and weight unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the du-ties of the position; and (b) Physical requirements if, in the opinion of the agency, after consid-ering the recommendation of an ac-credited physician, the preference eli-gible is physically able to perform effi-ciently the duties of the position for which the promotion is proposed. Subpart E—Appeals § 302.501 Entitlement. An individual who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) and is entitled to priority consideration under this part (see §302.103) may appeal a violation of his/ her restoration rights to the Merit Sys-tems Protection Board under the provi- sions of the Board’s regulations by pre-senting factual information that he or she was denied restoration rights be-cause of the employment of another person. Subpart F—Moving Employees and Positions into and Within the Excepted Service SOURCE : 89 FR 25046, April 9, 2024, unless otherwise noted. § 302.601 Scope. (a) This subpart applies to any situa- tion where an agency moves: (1) A position from the competitive service to the excepted service, or be-tween excepted services, whether pur-suant to statute, Executive Order, or an OPM issuance, to the extent that this subpart is not inconsistent with applicable statutory provisions; or (2) An employee who has accrued sta- tus and civil service protections under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, in-voluntarily to any position that is not covered by that chapter or subchapter. (b) This subpart also applies in situa- tions where a position previously gov-erned by title 5, United States Code will be governed by another title of the United States Code going forward, un-less the statute governing the excep-tion provides otherwise.

(a) In the event the President, Con- gress, OPM, or their designees direct agencies to move positions from the competitive service into the excepted service under Schedule A, B, or C, or any schedule in the excepted service created after May 9, 2024, or to move positions from a schedule in the ex-cepted service to a different schedule in the excepted service, the following requirements must be met, as relevant: (1) If the directive explicitly delin- eates the specific positions that are covered, the agency need only list the positions moved in accordance with that directive, and their location with-in the organization and provide the list to OPM. (2) If the directive requires the agen- cy to select the positions to be moved pursuant to criteria articulated in the directive, then the agency must pro-vide OPM with a list of the positions to be moved in accordance with those cri-teria, denote their location in the orga-nization, and explain, upon request from OPM, why the agency believes the positions met those criteria. (3) If the directive confers discretion on the agency to establish objective criteria for identifying the positions to be covered, or which specific slots of a particular type of position the agency intends to move, then the agency must, in addition to supplying a list of the identified positions or specific slots of particular types of position, supply OPM with the locations in the organi-zation, the objective criteria to be used, and an explanation of how these criteria are relevant. (b) An agency is also required to— (1) Identify the types, numbers, and locations of positions that the agency proposes to move into the excepted service. (2) Document the basis for its deter- mination that movement of the posi-tions is consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees as applicable. (3) Obtain certification from the agency’s Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) that the documentation is suf-ficient and movement of the positions is both consistent with the standards set forth by the directive, as applica-ble, and with merit system principles. (4) Submit the CHCO certification and supporting documentation to OPM (to include the types, numbers, and lo-cations of positions) in advance of using the excepted service authority, which OPM will then review. (5) For exceptions effectuated by the President or OPM, list positions to the appropriate schedule of the excepted service only after obtaining written ap-proval from the OPM Director to do so. For exceptions effectuated by Con-gress, inform OPM of the positions ex-cepted either before the effective date of the provision, if the statutory provi-sions are not immediately effective, or within 30 days thereafter.

Investigative leave is a nuanced personnel management topic that impacts both employees and agencies during sensitive workplace investigations. The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment procedures and seeks to clarify the specific standards and considerations agencies must follow when implementing investigative leave.

The question is particularly useful for:
- HR specialists who need to understand the legal and procedural requirements for placing employees on investigative leave
- Managers dealing with potential misconduct or workplace investigations
- Federal employees who want to understand their rights and the agency's obligations during investigative processes
- Legal professionals interpreting employment regulations

The criteria for investigative leave involve complex considerations such as due process, employee rights, administrative requirements, and potential disciplinary actions. Understanding these criteria is crucial for ensuring fair treatment, maintaining workplace integrity, and preventing potential legal challenges. The question goes beyond surface-level inquiry and seeks substantive knowledge about a specific administrative procedure, making it highly valuable for anyone involved in federal employment contexts."
" If an employee changes their work schedule during the 12-month parental leave period, how is the remaining balance of paid parental leave calculated?"," If an employee changes their scheduled tour of duty during the 12-month period, the remaining balance of paid parental leave must be recalculated based on the change in the number of average hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty. For example, if a regular full-time employee with 120 hours of unused paid parental leave converts to a part-time schedule of 20 hours per week, the balance would be recalculated proportionally to 60 hours (40/80 times 120 equals 60).","['a pe-riod of using paid parental leave) as follows: (1) For a regular full-time employee with 80 hours in the scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is 480 hours. (2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in §630.201 and described in §630.210), the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the em-ployee’s biweekly scheduled tour of duty (or 6 times the average hours if the biweekly tour hours vary over an established cycle). For example, if an employee has an uncommon tour con-sisting of six 24-hours shifts (144 hours) per biweekly pay period, the amount would be 864 hours. (3) For a part-time employee, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the em-ployee’s scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee has a part-time scheduled tour of duty that consists of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the amount would be 240 hours. (d) Conversion of weeks to days. For employees who are charged leave on a daily basis, the days equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks must be de-rived based on the average number of VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00925 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR916 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 630.1703 workdays in the employee’s established tour of duty over a biweekly pay pe-riod. For example, if an employee had 8 workdays each biweekly pay period, the days equivalent of 12 administra-tive workweeks would be 48 days. (e) Change in tour. If there is a change in an employee’s scheduled tour of duty during the 12-month period com-mencing on the date of a given birth or placement, and the employee has not used the full allotment of paid parental leave during such 12-month period, the remaining balance of paid parental leave must be recalculated based on the change in the number of average hours in the employee’s scheduled tour of duty. For example, if a regular full- time employee has a balance of 120 hours of unused paid parental leave for a 12-month period that is in progress and then converts to a part-time sched-ule of 20 hours per week, the balance would be recalculated to be 60 hours. (Since the old schedule was 80 hours bi-weekly or an average of 40 hours week-ly, the new part-time tour is half of the former full-time tour. 40/80 times 120 equals 60.) (f) Leave usage. (1) An agency may not require an employee to use annual leave or sick leave to the employee’s credit as a condition to be met before the employee uses paid parental leave. An employee may request to use an-nual leave or sick leave without invok-ing FMLA unpaid leave under subpart L of this part, and, in that case, the agency exercises its normal authority with respect to approving or dis-approving the timing of when the leave may be used. (2) Paid parental leave may be used in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement only during the 12- month period following birth or place-ment. (See §630.1703(b).) Paid parental leave may not be used prior to the birth or placement involved even if the employee was granted FMLA unpaid leave under §630.1203(a)(1) or (2) for pe-riods prior to the birth or placement event, as allowed under §630.1203(d). (3) An employee with a seasonal work schedule may not use paid parental leave during the off-season period des-ignated by the agency—the period dur-ing which the employee is scheduled to be released from work and placed in nonpay status. (g) Treatment of unused leave. If an employee has any unused balance of paid parental leave that remains at the end of the 12-month period following the birth or placement involved, the entitlement to the unused leave elapses at that time. No payment may be made for unused paid parental leave that has expired. Paid parental leave may not be considered annual leave for purposes of making a lump-sum payment for an-nual leave or for any other purpose. (h) Documentation of entitlement and employee certification. (1) At the request of the employee’s agency, an employee must provide the agency with appro-priate documentation that shows that the employee’s use of paid parental leave is directly connected to a birth or placement that has occurred. Appro-priate documentation may include, but is not limited to, a birth certificate or a document from an adoption or foster care agency regarding the placement. An agency is responsible for deter-mining what documentation is suffi-cient proof of entitlement. (2) An agency may require that an employee sign a certification attesting that the paid parental leave is being taken in connection with a birth or placement. This employee certification may contain a statement in which the employee acknowledges an under-standing of the consequences of pro-viding a false certification (e.g., the possibility that the employing agency could pursue appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal Service, or make a refer-ral to a Federal entity that inves-tigates whether conduct constitutes a criminal violation). (3) An employee must provide any documentation or certification re-quired by the agency no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such documentation or certifi-cation. If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for an employee to respond within the 15-day time frame, despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts, the em-ployee must provide the documenta-tion or certification within a reason-able period of time under the cir-cumstances involved, but no later than VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00926 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR917 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1705 30 calendar days after the date of the agency’s original request.

Under these circumstances, the granting of paid pa-rental leave is considered to be provi-sional, pending receipt of the requested documentation or certification. (5) If the employee fails to provide the agency with the required docu-mentation or certification within the specified time period, the agency may determine that the employee is not en-titled to paid parental leave and may— (i) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other', '(or later de-termined to have been eligible) for dis-abled veteran leave as an employee of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission and who subsequently commences employ-ment covered by this subpart, the 12- month eligibility period is the period that began on the first day of employ-ment with the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Com-mission (as determined under regula-tions issued by the Postmaster General to implement 5 U.S.C. 6329).

Employment means service as an em- ployee during which the employee is covered by a leave system under which leave is charged for periods of absence. This excludes service in a position in which the employee is not covered by 5 U.S.C. 6329 due to application of an-other statutory authority.

Health care provider has the meaning given that term in §630.1202. Hired means the action of— (1) Receiving an initial appointment to a civilian position in the Federal Government in which the service quali-fies as employment under this subpart; (2) Receiving a qualifying reappoint- ment to a civilian position in the Fed-eral Government in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart; or (3) Returning to duty status in a ci- vilian position in the Federal Govern-ment in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart, when such return immediately followed a break in civilian duty (with the em-ployee in continuous civilian leave sta-tus) to perform military service. Medical certificate means a written statement signed by a health care pro-vider certifying to the treatment of a veteran’s qualifying service-connected disability. Medical treatment means any activity carried out or prescribed by a health care provider to treat a veteran’s quali-fying service-connected disability. Military service means ‘‘active mili- tary, naval, or air service’’ as that term is defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(24). Qualifying reappointment means an appointment of a former employee of the Federal Government following a break in employment of at least 90 cal-endar days. Qualifying service-connected disability means a veteran’s service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more by the Veteran Benefits Administra-tion, including a combined degree of disability of 30 percent or more that re-flects the combined effect of multiple individual disabilities, which resulted in the award of disability compensa-tion under title 38, United States Code. A temporary disability rating under 38 U.S.C. 1156 is considered a valid rating in applying this definition for as long as it is in effect. Service-connected has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). Veteran has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(2). Veterans Benefits Administration means the Veterans Benefits Adminis-tration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. § 630.1304 Eligibility. (a) An employee who is a veteran with a qualifying service-connected disability is entitled to disabled vet-eran leave under this subpart, which will be available for use during the 12- month eligibility period beginning on the first day of employment. For each employee, there is a single first day of employment. (b) In order to be eligible for disabled veteran leave, an employee must pro-vide to the agency documentation from the Veterans Benefits Administration certifying that the employee has a qualifying service-connected disability. The documentation should be provided to the agency— (1) Upon the first day of employment, if the employee has already received such certifying documentation; or (2) For an employee who has not yet received such certifying documenta-tion from the Veterans Benefit Admin-istration, as soon as practicable after the employee receives the certifying documentation.

The 12-month eligibility period is fixed based on the first day of employment and is not af-fected by the timing of when certifying documentation is provided. (d) If an employee’s service-con- nected disability rating is decreased or discontinued during the 12-month eligi-bility period such that the employee no longer has a qualifying service-con-nected disability— (1) The employee must notify the agency of the effective date of the change in the disability rating; and (2) The employee is no longer eligible for disabled veteran leave as of the ef-fective date of the rating change. § 630.1305 Crediting disabled veteran leave. (a) Upon receipt of the certifying documentation under §630.1304, an agency must credit 104 hours of dis-abled veteran leave to a full-time, non-seasonal employee or a proportionally equivalent amount for employees with part-time, seasonal, or uncommon tours of duty, except as otherwise pro-vided in this section. (b) The proportional equivalent of 104 hours for a full-time employee is deter-mined for employees with other sched-ules as follows: (1) For an employee with a part-time work schedule, the 104 hours is pro-rated based on the number of hours in the part-time schedule (as established for leave charging purposes) relative to a full-time schedule (e.g., 52 hours for a half-time schedule); (2) For an employee with a seasonal work schedule, the 104 hours is pro-rated based on the total projected hours to be worked in an annual period of 52 weeks (based on the seasonal em-ployee’s seasonal work periods and full- time or part-time schedule during those periods) relative to a full-time work year of 2,080 hours (e.g., 52 hours for a seasonal employee who works full-time for half a year); and (3) For an employee with an uncom- mon tour of duty (as', 'Director, 6508 Dogwood Parkway, Suite E, Jackson, MS 39213, (601) 965–4140 Human Resources Management Officer, Montgomery Medical Center, 215 Perry Hill Road, Montgomery, AL 36109–3798, (334) 272– 4670 Human Resources Management Officer, Tuskegee Medical Center, 2400 Hospital Road, Tuskegee, AL 36083–5001, (334) 727– 0550 Human Resources Management Officer, Tus- caloosa Medical Center, 3701 Loop Road, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404, (205) 554–2000, ext. 2542 Fort Mitchell National Cemetery, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center, 2400 Hospital Road, Tuskegee, AL 36083–5001, (334) 727–0550 Mobile Outpatient Clinic Substation, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center, 400 Veterans Blvd., Bi-loxi, MS 39531, (601) 388–5541, ext. 5780 Alaska Fort Richardson (Sitka) National Cemetery, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center & Regional Of-fice, 2925 DeBarr Road, Anchorage, AK 99508–2989, (907) 257–4750 Human Resources Management Officer, An- chorage Medical Center & Regional Office, 2925 DeBarr Road, Anchorage, AK 99508– 2989, (907) 257–4750 Arizona Human Resources Management Officer, Pres- cott Medical Center, 500 N.

(d) An SESCDP is a training oppor- tunity for which agencies must recruit consistent with merit system prin-ciples and paragraph (d)(1) of this sec-tion. An agency must provide proce-dures under which selections are made from among either all qualified persons or all qualified persons in the civil service. If selected, the individual par-ticipates in the agency’s SESCDP. (1) An individual who does not cur- rently hold a career or career-type civil service appointment may only participate in an SESCDP by means of a Schedule B appointment authorized by 5 CFR 213.3202(j) to a full-time posi-tion created for developmental pur-poses connected with the SESCDP. Ex-ercising its authority under §302.101(c)(6) of this chapter, OPM here-by exempts these full-time positions created for developmental purposes connected with the SESCDP from the appointment procedures of part 302 of this chapter. Competition for these ap-pointments must be conducted pursu-ant to SES merit staffing procedures at §317.501 of this chapter, except agencies must follow the principle of veterans’ preference as far as administratively feasible, in accordance with §302.101(c) of this chapter. Candidates serving under this Schedule B appointment may not be used to fill an agency’s reg-ular positions on a continuing basis. (2) An individual who currently holds a career or career-type appointment in the civil service must be selected through SES merit staffing procedures at §317.501 of this chapter. Subject to the approval of the agency in which the selectee is employed, such an indi-vidual may be selected for and partici-pate in an SESCDP in any agency while serving in his or her position of record. The individual may continue to participate in the SESCDP upon mov-ing to other civil service positions under career or career-type appoint-ment, assuming the employing agency approves. An SESCDP competition does not satisfy the requirements of part 335 of this chapter and therefore does not provide an independent basis to appoint or promote a career or ca-reer-type appointee. (3) A career or career-type appointee may participate in an SESCDP con-ducted by an agency other than his or her employing agency under such terms as are mutually agreeable and outlined in a Memorandum of Under-standing (MOU) signed by both agen-cies involved. The MOU should be sub-mitted to OPM after the candidate is selected and before the program begins. Terms of the MOU must be consistent with applicable provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, and a copy must be pro-vided to OPM. Either agency may de- cline or discontinue a candidate’s par-ticipation if such terms cannot be ne-gotiated or are not fulfilled. (4) Any candidate’s participation in an SESCDP is at the discretion of the employing agency and subject to provi-sions established under 5 CFR 412.302(a) for removing a participant who does not make adequate progress in the pro-gram. (5) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a ‘‘career-type’’ appointment means a career or career-conditional appoint-ment or an appointment of equivalent tenure. An appointment of equivalent tenure is considered to be an appoint-ment in the excepted service that is placed in Group I or Group II under section 351.502(b).

Subpart F—Removal of Career Appointees as a Result of Re-duction in Force § 359.601 General. (a) Coverage. (1) This subpart covers the removal of a career appointee from the SES']",5,"The context provides a direct and clear explanation in section (e) about how the remaining balance of paid parental leave is recalculated when an employee changes their scheduled tour of duty during the 12-month period, with a specific numerical example demonstrating the proportional calculation method.",5,"This is an excellent, highly practical question that directly addresses a nuanced aspect of federal employee leave policies under Title 5. The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the complexities surrounding parental leave administration. It is particularly useful for:

1. HR Specialists: Provides critical guidance on how to pro-rate and track parental leave when an employee's work schedule changes, which requires precise calculation and policy interpretation.

2. Federal Employees: Helps employees understand how schedule modifications might impact their remaining paid parental leave balance, enabling better personal planning.

3. Managers: Offers insight into the administrative considerations when supporting employees during parental leave transitions.

The question goes beyond a basic leave inquiry by exploring a specific scenario that requires careful policy application. It addresses a real-world situation where work schedule flexibility intersects with leave entitlements, making it highly relevant for federal employment policy understanding.

The technical nature of the question suggests the asker is seeking precise regulatory interpretation, which is exactly the type of substantive knowledge that Title 5 regulations are designed to provide clarity about. The query demonstrates a nuanced approach to understanding employee rights and leave administration in the federal workplace."
" For an employee with multiple children born or placed in the same year, how does the paid parental leave policy work?
"," According to §630.1707, if an employee has multiple children born or placed on the same day, it is considered a single event triggering a single entitlement of up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave. However, if children are born or placed during different times within a 12-month period, each event generates a separate 12-week entitlement. If paid parental leave is used during overlapping 12-month periods, it will count towards the 12-week limit for each respective event.","['14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00929 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR920 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 630.1707 enter into the written agreement after being determined by the agency to no longer be incapacitated, the agency must cancel any portion of the 12 weeks of paid parental leave that has not been exhausted, and designate as invalid any paid parental leave that was used based on the conditional ap-proval. The time covered by the invali-dated paid parental leave must be con-verted to leave without pay unless the employee requests that other paid leave or paid time off to the employee’s credit be applied (as appropriate) in place of the invalidated paid parental leave. To the extent the employee has invalidated paid parental leave hours not replaced by other paid leave or paid time off, pay received for those hours is a debt to the employing agency and is subject to collection under the Federal Claims Collection Standards in 31 CFR parts 900 through 904. § 630.1707 Cases of multiple children born or placed in the same time pe-riod. (a) If an employee has multiple chil- dren born or placed on the same day, the multiple-child birth/placement event is considered to be a single event that triggers a single entitlement of up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave under §630.1703(b). (b) If an employee has one or more children born or placed during the 12- month period following the date of an earlier birth or placement of a child of the employee, the provisions of this subpart shall be independently admin-istered for each birth or placement event. Any paid parental leave sub-stituted for FMLA unpaid leave during the 12-month period beginning on the date of a child’s birth or placement shall count towards the 12-week limit on paid parental leave described in §630.1703(b) applicable in connection with the birth or placement involved. The substitution of paid parental leave may count toward multiple 12-week limits to the extent that there are mul-tiple ongoing 12-month periods begin-ning on the date of an applicable birth or placement, each of which encom-passes the day on which the leave is used. Therefore, whenever paid paren-tal leave is substituted during periods of time when separate 12-month periods (each beginning on a date of birth or placement) overlap, the paid parental leave will count toward each affected period’s 12-week limit. For example, if an employee has a child born on June 1 and another child placed for adoption on October 1 of the same year, each event would generate entitlement to substitute up to 12 weeks of paid paren- tal leave during the separate 12-month periods beginning on the date of the birth and on the date of the placement, respectively. Those two 12-month peri-ods would be June 1–May 31 and Octo-ber 1–September 30. The overlap period for these two 12-month periods would be October 1–May 31. If the employee substitutes paid parental leave during that overlap period, that amount of paid parental leave would count to-wards both the 12-week limit associ-ated with the birth event and the 12- week limit associated with the place-ment event. § 630.1708 Records and reports. (a) Record of usage of paid parental leave. An agency must maintain an ac- curate record of an employee’s usage of paid parental leave. (b) Reporting. In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record usage of paid pa-rental leave in the manner prescribed by the Office of Personnel Manage-ment.

The rules in this subchapter shall apply to all positions in the competi-tive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly pro-vided in the', 'established for leave charging purposes) relative to a full-time schedule (e.g., 52 hours for a half-time schedule); (2) For an employee with a seasonal work schedule, the 104 hours is pro-rated based on the total projected hours to be worked in an annual period of 52 weeks (based on the seasonal em-ployee’s seasonal work periods and full- time or part-time schedule during those periods) relative to a full-time work year of 2,080 hours (e.g., 52 hours for a seasonal employee who works full-time for half a year); and (3) For an employee with an uncom- mon tour of duty (as defined in §630.201 and described in §630.210), 104 hours is proportionally increased based on the number of hours in the uncommon tour relative to the hours in a regular full- time tour (e.g., 187 hours for an em- ployee with a 72-hour weekly uncom-mon tour of duty.) (c) When an employee is converted to a different tour of duty for leave pur-poses, the employee’s balance of un-used disabled veteran leave must be converted to the proper number of hours based on the proportion of hours in the new tour of duty compared to the former tour of duty. For seasonal employees, hours must be annualized in determining the proportion. (d) The amount of disabled veteran leave initially credited to an employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sec-tion must be offset by the number of hours of sick leave an employee has credited to his or her account as of the first day of employment. For example, if an employee is being reappointed and having sick leave recredited upon such reappointment, the amount of disabled veteran leave must be reduced by the amount of such recredited sick leave. Similarly, if an employee is returning to civilian duty status after a period of leave for military service, that em-ployee may have a balance of sick leave, which must be used to offset the disabled veteran leave. (e)(1) An employee who was pre- viously employed by an agency whose employees were not subject to 5 U.S.C. 6329 must certify, at the time the em-ployee is hired in a position subject to 5 U.S.C. 6329, whether or not that former agency provided entitlement to an equivalent disabled veteran leave benefit to be used in connection with the medical treatment of a service-con-nected disability rated at 30 percent or more. The employee must certify the date he or she commenced the period of eligibility to use disabled veteran leave in the former agency. (2) If 12 months have elapsed since the commencing date referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the em-ployee will be considered to have re-ceived the full amount of an equivalent benefit and no benefit may be provided under this subpart. (3) If the employee is still within the 12-month period that began on the commencing date referenced in para-graph (e)(1) of this section, the em-ployee must certify the number of hours of disabled veteran leave used at VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00909 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR900 5 CFR Ch.

The gaining agency must offset the number of hours of dis-abled veteran leave to be credited to the employee by the number of such hours used by the employee at such agency, while making no offset under paragraph (d) of this section. If the em-ployee had a different type of work schedule at the former agency, the hours used at the former agency must be converted before applying the offset, consistent with §630.1305(c). § 630.1306 Requesting and using dis- abled veteran leave. (a) An employee may use disabled veteran leave only for the medical treatment of a qualifying service-con-nected disability. The medical treat-ment may include a period of rest, but only if such period of rest is specifi-cally ordered by the health care pro-vider as part of a prescribed course of treatment for the qualifying service- connected disability. (b)(1) An employee must file an appli- cation—written, oral, or electronic, as required by the agency—to use disabled veteran leave. The application must in-clude a personal self-certification by the employee that the requested leave will be (or was) used for purposes of being furnished medical treatment for a qualifying service-connected dis-ability. The application must also in-clude the specific days and hours of ab-sence required for the treatment. The application must be submitted within such time limits as the agency may re-quire. (2) An employee must request ap- proval to use disabled veteran leave in advance unless the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable—e.g., due to a medical emergency or the unex-pected availability of an appointment for surgery or other critical treatment. The employee must provide notice within a reasonable period of time ap-propriate to the circumstances in-volved. If the agency determines that the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable and that the employee is unable to provide advance notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be delayed or denied. (c)(1) When an employee did not pro- vide the agency with certification of a qualifying service-connected disability before having a period of absence for treatment of such disability, the em-ployee is entitled to substitute ap-proved disabled veteran leave retro-actively for such period of absence (ex-cluding periods of suspension or ab-sence without leave (AWOL), but in-cluding leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time off, or other paid time off) in the 12-month eligibility period. Such retroactive substitution cancels the use of the original leave or paid time off and re-quires appropriate adjustments. In the case of retroactive substitution for a period when an employee used ad-vanced annual leave or advanced sick leave, the adjustment is a liquidation of the leave indebtedness covered by the substitution. (2) An agency may require an em- ployee to submit the medical certifi-cation described in §630.1307(a) before approving such retroactive substi-tution. § 630.1307 Medical certification. (a) In addition to the employee’s self- certification required under §630.1306(b)(1), an agency may addition-ally require that the use of disabled veteran leave be supported by a signed written medical certification issued by a health care provider. (b) When an agency requires a signed written medical certification by a health care provider, the agency may specify that the certification include— (1) A statement by the health care provider that the medical treatment is for one or more service-connected dis-abilities of the employee that resulted in 30 percent or more disability rating; (2) The date or dates of treatment or, if the treatment', 'Pub.

Ex-cept as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an employee must serve at least 3 years of creditable service as de-fined in paragraph (b) of this section to become a career employee. (b) Creditable service. Unless otherwise approved by OPM, the service required for career tenure must include service as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and total at least 3 years. (1) Nontemporary employment. To be creditable, the 3 years of service must begin with one of the following: (i) Nontemporary appointment in the competitive service: For this purpose, nontemporary appointment includes a career-conditional appointment. The 3 years may also begin, but not end, with status quo employment under subpart G of part 316 of this chapter, an over-seas limited appointment of indefinite duration, or an overseas limited term appointment under part 301 of this chapter.

It demonstrates a practical information need that would be valuable for:

1. Federal employees planning family expansion
2. HR specialists who need to accurately interpret and apply leave policies
3. Managers understanding employee leave entitlements
4. Parents seeking to understand their specific rights under federal employment regulations

The question goes beyond a basic inquiry by highlighting a specific scenario (multiple children born/placed in the same year), which suggests a genuine need for detailed policy interpretation. This indicates the questioner is seeking substantive knowledge about the application of parental leave policies.

The topic falls directly under Title 5's coverage of employee benefits and leave policies, making it highly applicable to federal employment contexts. While not a simple yes/no question, it requires a nuanced explanation of how the policy is implemented in complex family situations.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it might apply to a relatively specific subset of federal employees. However, it still represents an important and thoughtful inquiry into federal employment benefits."

If a person seeks information from OPM in a format that does not currently exist, OPM will not ordinarily compile the information for the purpose of creating a record to respond to the request. OPM will ad-vise the individual that it does not have records in the format sought. If other existing records would reason-ably respond to the request or portions of it, OPM may provide these. If fees as provided in §294.109 apply to any alter-native records, OPM will advise the re-quester before providing the records.

Any person may ask for records under sec-tion 552 of title 5, United States Code, by directing a letter to one of the orga-nizations listed in §294.107, or by deliv-ering a request in person at the ad-dresses listed in that section during business hours on a regular business day. (b) Proper marking. Each request for records should have a clear and promi-nent notation on the first page, such as ‘‘Freedom of Information Act Re-quest.’’ In addition, if sent by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, mark the outside clearly and prominently with ‘‘FOIA Request’’ or ‘‘Freedom of Information Act Re-quest.’’ (c) Contents of request letter. A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OPM per-sonnel to locate the records with a rea-sonable amount of effort. (1) OPM will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph, if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive to OPM operations. (2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, re-cipient, and subject matter of the record. (3) If an OPM organization deter- mines that a request does not reason-ably describe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additional information needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. OPM will also offer the record seeker an op-portunity to confer, with the objective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirements of this section. (d) Medical records. OPM or another Government agency may disclose the medical records of an applicant, em-ployee, or annuitant to the subject of the record, or to a representative des-ignated in writing. However, medical records may contain information about an individual’s mental or physical con-dition that a prudent physician would hesitate to', 'even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position held by an em-ployee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a locality rate, a special rate under this subpart or a similar rate under 38 U.S.C. 7455, or a retained rate, but ex-cluding additional pay of any other kind. Rate range or range means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or similar rates under other legal author-ity. Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range appli-cable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Serv-ice, under 5 CFR 359.705. Special rate means a rate of pay with- in a special rate schedule established under this subpart.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 530.303 to provide higher rates of pay for speci- fied categories of GS positions or em-ployees at one or more grades. An in-creased or decreased special rate sched-ule refers to an increase or decrease in one or more rate ranges within that schedule. Special rate supplement means the por- tion of a special rate paid above an em-ployee’s GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supple-ment equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer’s LEO spe-cial base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law en-forcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Exec-utive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in §530.304(a). [70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008] § 530.303 Coverage. (a) Under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may es- tablish special rates for employees paid under a statutory pay system (as de-fined in 5 U.S.C. 5302(1)) or any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for civilian positions in the executive branch. Special rates apply only to GS employees unless the approved schedule coverage criteria specifically state otherwise. OPM will establish special rate schedules cov-ering employees under a non-GS pay system only at the request of the agen-cy responsible for administering that system. For employees covered by a non-GS pay system, the responsible agency is subject to the requirements in 5 U.S.C. 5305. To the extent the stat-utory or regulatory provisions gov-erning the non-GS pay system differ from the regulatory provisions of this subpart, the responsible agency must follow policies that are consistent as possible with this subpart. (b) An employee’s coverage under a special rate schedule is subject to the coverage conditions established by OPM for that schedule, except as pro-vided in paragraph (c) of this section. The coverage conditions for a special rate schedule may be based on occupa-tion, grade, employing agency, geo-graphic location of official worksite, or other factors OPM may determine to be appropriate. An agency determina- tion as to whether an employee meets the coverage conditions for a special rate schedule must be based on the em-ployee’s position of record and official worksite. An agency also may be re-quired to consider other employee-spe-cific factors established by OPM to de-termine special rate coverage, such as special qualifications or certifications. (c) An agency must pay the applica- ble special rate to any employee who meets the coverage conditions estab-lished by OPM with respect to a special rate schedule unless an authorized agency official determines that a cat-egory of employees of the agency will not be covered by a proposed or exist-ing special rate schedule, subject to the following requirements: (1) An authorized agency official may determine that a category of employ-ees of the agency will not be covered by a special rate request or a proposed new special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The notice must be received by OPM before the effective date of the new special rate schedule. (2) An authorized agency official may remove a category of employees of the agency from coverage under an exist-ing special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The loss of coverage under a special rate schedule will become effective on the first day of the first pay period be-ginning on or after the date of the no-tice to OPM. (d) An employee covered by a special rate schedule is not entitled to a spe-cial rate for any purpose with respect to any period during which the em-ployee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other legal author-ity.

(e) An agency must make a lump-sum payment to an employee who transfers to a position excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(x)–(xiii) for any annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) upon transfer to an ex-cepted position. However, the agency may not make a lump-sum payment for any annual leave in the employee’s reg-ular leave account upon transfer to the excepted position. The agency must hold such annual leave in abeyance for recredit if the employee is subse-quently reemployed without a break in service in a position to which his or her accumulated and accrued annual leave may be transferred. If the employee later becomes eligible for a lump-sum payment under the conditions specified in this section, the current employing agency must make a lump-sum pay-ment for the annual leave held in abey-ance. The agency must compute the lump-sum payment under §550.1205(b) based on the pay the employee was re-ceiving immediately before the date of the transfer to the position excepted by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(x)–(xiii). An employee who elects to retain his or her leave benefits upon accepting a Presidential appointment, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), is not entitled to receive a lump-sum payment.

This definition in-cludes the definition of medical records at 29 CFR 1910.20(c)(6); when the term ‘‘Occupational Medical Record’’ is used in these regulations, it includes ‘‘Em-ployee Exposure Records’’ (as that term is defined in this section) and oc-cupational illness, accident, and injury records. Non-occupational/Patient Record means a record of treatment or exam-ination, created and maintained by a health care facility, when the person is admitted to or voluntarily seeks treat-ment at the health care facility for non-job-related reasons. Records main-tained by an agency dispensary are pa-tient records for the purposes of these regulations except when such records result as a condition of employment or relate to an on-the-job occurrence. In these cases, the records are ‘‘Occupa-tional Medical Records’’ as defined herein.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a critical mechanism for transparency in government, and understanding how to properly submit a request to OPM is important for federal employees, researchers, journalists, and citizens seeking information. The question addresses a specific procedural need that has practical implications for accessing government records. It would be particularly useful for individuals wanting to obtain personnel records, policy information, or other documents from OPM. While the question is somewhat narrow in scope, it provides valuable guidance on a specific administrative process within the federal employment system.

This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) implementing 5 U.S.C 5332, 5333, and 5334, which deal with setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for General Schedule (GS) employees. These regu-lations are supplemented by regula-tions on GS within-grade increases in subpart D of this part; GS quality step increases in subpart E of this part; lo-cality rates in subpart F of this part; special rates in 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; and grade and pay retention in 5 CFR part 536. § 531.202 Coverage. This subpart covers employees who occupy positions classified and paid under the GS classification and pay system, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5102 and 5331 or other applicable laws. Law en-forcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. This subpart also covers GS em-ployees who receive special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, sub-part C. § 531.203 Definitions. In this subpart: Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 or an agency in the legislative branch with employees covered by this subpart. To the extent that the regulations in this subpart re-late to non-GS service in the Federal Government, agency includes any other agency in the Federal Government. Demotion means a change of an em- ployee, while continuously employed, from one GS grade to a lower GS grade, with or without a reduction in pay. Employee means an employee as de- fined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is covered by VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm', 'con-sultant: (1) The level and difficulty of the work to be performed; (2) The qualifications of the expert or consultant; (3) The pay rates of comparable indi- viduals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors; and (4) The availability of qualified can- didates. (c) An expert or consultant appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3109 may be employed without pay, provided the individual agrees in advance in writing to waive any claim for compensation for those services. § 304.105 Daily and biweekly basic pay limitations. (a) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, agencies subject to chapter 51 and sub-chapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, may not pay for any 1 day an aggregate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) that exceeds the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under 5 U.S.C. 5332—that is, the daily rate for GS–15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding local-ity pay or any other additional pay). The daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS–15, step 10, rate by 2,087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. (b) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, an expert or consultant shall not be paid for any biweekly pay period an aggre-gate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) in excess of the biweekly rate of pay for GS–15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding locality pay or any other additional pay). The biweekly rate is computed by dividing VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00167 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR158 5 CFR Ch.

(a) The employing agency has the au- thority to adjust the pay of experts and consultants after initial appointment and to establish appropriate policies governing the amount and timing of any such adjustments, subject to the limitations of §304.105. In addition to the factors listed in §304.104(b), the agency may consider factors such as job performance, contributions to agency mission, and the general pay in-creases granted to other Federal em-ployees. Experts and consultants are not entitled to receive automatic ad-justments in their rates of basic pay at the time of general pay increases under 5 U.S.C. 5303 unless specifically pro-vided for in the official appointing doc-ument. In the absence of such auto-matic entitlement, any pay adjust-ments are at the agency’s discretion. (b) Experts and consultants paid on a daily rate basis are not entitled to overtime pay under section 5542 of title 5, United States Code. Otherwise, ex-perts and consultants qualify for pre-mium pay under subchapter V of chap-ter 55 of title 5, United States Code, if they meet the applicable eligibility re-quirements (including the requirement that an employee have a regularly scheduled tour of duty, where applica-ble). (c) Experts and consultants may be entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act if they are non-exempt under OPM regulations imple-menting that Act for Federal employ-ees. (See 5 CFR part 551). (d) An expert or consultant may be paid for service on an intermittent basis in more than one expert or con-sultant position, provided the pay is not received for the same period of time (5 U.S.C. 5533(d)(1)). (e) Experts and consultants are sub- ject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344 and 8468 on reduction of basic pay by the amount of annuity received. (f) Experts and consultants are sub- ject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5532 on reduction of retired military pay. (g) Experts and consultants with a regularly scheduled tour of duty ( i.e., not intermittent) are entitled to sick and annual leave in accordance with chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, and to pay for any holiday occur-ring on a workday on which they per-form no work, provided that workday is part of the basic workweek. Those employed on an intermittent basis do not earn leave and are not entitled to paid holidays. § 304.107 Reports. As required by 5 U.S.C. 3109(e), each agency shall report to the Office of Personnel Management on an annual basis: (a) The number of days the agency employed each paid expert or consult-ant; and (b) The total amount the agency paid each expert or consultant so employed. (Do not include payments for travel and related expenses.) § 304.108 Compliance. (a) Each agency using 5 U.S.C. 3109 must establish and maintain a system of controls and oversight necessary to assure compliance with 5 U.S.C. 3109 and these regulations. The system must include— (1) Appropriate training and informa- tion procedures to ensure that officials and employees using the authority un-derstand the statutory and regulatory requirements; and (2) Appropriate provision for review of expert and consultant appointments. (b) OPM will, as necessary— (1) Review agency employment of ex- perts and consultants and agency con-trols and oversight to determine com-pliance; and (2) Issue instructions and guidance to agencies on employing experts and con-sultants and on reporting procedures.

For the purposes of preference in Federal employment, the following definitions apply: (a) Veteran means a person who has been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honor-able conditions, or who has a certifi-cation as defined in paragraph (h) of this section, if the active duty service was performed: (1) In a war; (2) In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been au-thorized; (3) During the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955; (4) For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period be-ginning February 1, 1955, and ending October 14, 1976; (5) During the period beginning Au- gust 2, 1990, and ending January 2, 1992; or (6) For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period be-ginning September 11, 2001, and ending on August 31, 2010, the last']",5,"The context directly addresses citizenship requirements in § 7.3, which explicitly states that a person must be a citizen or national of the United States to be admitted to a competitive examination and to receive an appointment in the competitive service, with a narrow exception for OPM to authorize alien appointments in specific cases to promote service efficiency.",5,"This is an excellent, highly relevant question that directly addresses a fundamental aspect of federal employment regulations under Title 5. The question explores citizenship requirements for federal employment, which is a critical consideration for:

1. Job applicants seeking federal positions
2. HR specialists responsible for screening and hiring
3. Managers involved in recruitment processes
4. Legal and compliance teams ensuring proper hiring practices

The question touches on a core eligibility requirement that impacts who can enter the competitive service, which is a key component of federal employment policy. It addresses a practical, substantive information need that has direct implications for recruitment, hiring, and equal opportunity in federal employment.

Citizenship requirements are fundamental to federal employment, and understanding these requirements is essential for both potential applicants and federal HR professionals. This question would help individuals understand the legal framework governing federal employment eligibility, making it highly useful for anyone involved in or interested in federal job opportunities.

The technical nature of the question suggests it is seeking precise, authoritative information about federal employment regulations, which aligns perfectly with the purpose of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations."

This amount includes overtime pay, maintenance allowances, and other payments in money or kind. (b) An agency may pay a student-em- ployee a stipend in excess of the amount prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section only if the Office of Per-sonnel Management has determined that a higher maximum stipend is war-ranted for the student-employee. (c) Maximum stipends for positions in the Public Health Service in which duty requires intimate contact with persons afflicted with leprosy are in-creased above the rates prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section to the same extent that additional pay is pro-vided by Public Health Service Regula-tions (42 CFR 22.1) for employees sub-ject to the General Schedule (part 531 of this chapter). (d) Overtime pay, maintenance allow- ances, and other payments in money or kind for a student-employee must be considered as part of the student-em-ployee’s stipend for the purposes of this section, and therefore, may not be used to cause the stipend to exceed the max-imum stipend established under this section.

While it relates to compensation for medical students, which could be relevant to federal internship or training programs, the specificity of the query limits its broad applicability. The question touches on an OPM compensation policy, which is within the scope of Title 5 regulations, but appears to be quite narrow in focus. 

Relevance is moderate, as it pertains to federal compensation guidelines. Practicality is somewhat limited since it seems to target a very specific scenario of medical student stipends. The information could be valuable for HR specialists in medical training programs, federal health agencies, or students seeking federal medical training opportunities. However, the extremely precise nature of the question (fourth-year specifically) reduces its general utility.

The question demonstrates a genuine information need about federal compensation policies, which gives it some merit. For HR professionals dealing with medical training programs or federal health service recruitment, this could provide important details about stipend structures. However, for most federal employees or managers, this would be a niche inquiry with limited broader application."

Notwith- standing paragraph (b) of this section, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5542(b)(1) and §550.112(h), an agent must be deemed to have performed 2 hours of irregular overtime work for a lesser amount of irregular overtime work if— (1) An agent is required perform such work on a day when the agent was not scheduled to work; or (2) An agent is required to return to the agent’s place of employment to perform such work. (d) Earning limited by premium pay cap. An agent may not be credited with earning compensatory time off if the value of such time off would cause the sum of the agent’s basic pay and pre-mium pay in the given pay period to exceed the limitation established under 5 U.S.C. 5547 and §§550.105 and 550.107 in the period in which it was earned. The dollar value of compensatory time off for the purpose of this paragraph is the amount of overtime pay the agent would have received for the period dur-ing which compensatory time off was earned if the overtime had been regu-larly scheduled outside the agent’s reg-ular tour of duty. (e) Pay period limit. (1) An agent may not earn more than 10 hours of compen-satory time off during any pay period unless— (i) CBP, as it determines appropriate, approves in writing a waiver of the 10- hour limit; and (ii) Such waiver approval is executed in advance of the performance of any work for which compensatory time off is earned. (2) If a waiver of the 10-hour limit de- scribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this sec-tion is not granted, the agent involved may not be ordered to perform the as-sociated overtime work. (f) Annual period limit. An agent may not earn more than 240 hours of com-pensatory time off during an annual period. (g) Usage. (1) An agent may use com- pensatory time off by being excused from duty during regular time (in an amount equal to the compensatory time off being used) during the agent’s basic workweek.

(h) Time limit for usage and forfeiture. An agent must use any hours of com-pensatory time off not later than the end of the 26th pay period after the pay period during which the compensatory time off was earned. Any compensatory time off not used within that time limit, or prior to separation from an agent position, is forfeited and not available for any purpose, regardless of the circumstances. An agent may not receive any cash value for unused com-pensatory time off. An agent may not receive credit towards the computation of the agent’s retirement annuity for unused compensatory time off. § 550.1626 Leave without pay during regular time and absences during obligated overtime hours. (a) Substitution for leave without pay during regular time. (1) For any period of leave without pay during an agent’s regular time (basic workweek), an equal period of work outside the agent’s regular time in the same pay period must be substituted to the ex-tent such work was performed. Any time substituted for leave without pay must be treated for all pay computa-tion purposes as if it were regular time (except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) and may not be consid-ered an overtime hour of work for any purpose, including §§550.1621(a)(4) and (b)(4), 550.1624, and 550.1625. (2) Hours of work must be substituted for regular time work under paragraph (a)(1) of this section before being sub-stituted for regularly scheduled over-time within the agent’s regular tour of duty under paragraph (b) of this sec-tion. (3) Hours used for substitution under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be substituted in the following priority order: first, irregular overtime hours; second, regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty; and third, regularly scheduled over-time hours within the regular tour of duty. (4) The substitution of overtime hours for leave without pay is solely for pay computation purposes. The sub-stitution does not change the hours of an agent’s basic workweek or the fact that the agent was in a particular type of nonpay status during those hours. The hours that are substituted are con-sidered to have been performed when they were worked, not during the leave without pay hours for which they are substituted. For example, if an agent performs 4 hours of overtime work out-side the agent’s regular tour of duty during the first week of a pay period and then is placed in leave without pay during the second week due to a shut-down furlough caused by a lapse in ap-propriations, the 4 hours must be sub-stituted for furlough hours for the pur-pose of computing pay owed the agent for the week before the furlough began. (5) If overtime hours are substituted for an absence without approval (AWOL) or a suspension, the basic pay for such substituted hours may not be used in computing an agent’s overtime supplement. (b) Substitution for absences during ob- ligated overtime hours within the regular tour of duty. (1) For a period of absence during obligated overtime hours within an agent’s regular tour of duty, an equal period of work outside the agent’s regular tour of duty in the same pay period must be substituted to the extent such work was performed. Any time so substituted must be treat-ed for all pay computation purposes as if it were obligated overtime work and may not be considered an overtime hour of work for any other purpose, in-cluding §§550.1624 and 550.1625. (2) In substituting hours of work under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, work performed on the same day as the period of absence must be substituted first in circumstances described in §550.1622(b)(2). Hours substituted under this paragraph must be substituted in the following priority order: first, ir-regular overtime hours; and second, regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty. (3) After substituting hours under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any re-maining hours used for substitution under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be substituted in the following priority order: first, irregular overtime hours; and second, regularly scheduled VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38', 'lowest sched-uled rate of the grade to which pro-moted which exceeds the employee’s existing scheduled rate of pay by at least four percent of the representative rate of the grade from which promoted. (b) If there is no rate in the grade to which an employee is promoted which meets the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section the employee shall be entitled to the higher of: (1) the exist-ing scheduled rate of pay in accordance with part 536 of this chapter; or (2) the maximum scheduled rate of the grade to which promoted. (c) If the promotion is to a position in a different wage area, the agency shall determine the employee’s pay en-titlement as if there were two pay ac-tions—a promotion and a reassign-ment—and shall process them in the order which gives the employee the maximum benefit. § 532.409 Grading or regrading of posi- tions.

(a) If an employee becomes entitled to more than one pay change at the same time, the employing agency shall process the pay changes in the order which will provide the maximum ben-efit, except as required by paragraph (b) of this section. (b) If an employee becomes entitled to an increase in pay and subject to a personnel or appointment change at the same time, the increased rate of pay is deemed to be the employee’s ex-isting scheduled rate of pay when the personnel or appointment change is processed. § 532.415 Application of new or revised wage schedules. (a) The head of each installation or activity in a wage area shall place new or revised wage schedules into effect at the beginning of the first full shift on the date specified on the schedule by the lead agency. (b) No agency may retroactively change any personnel or pay actions taken between the effective date of a new or revised wage schedule and the date it is actually put into effect if the personnel or pay actions taken during this period of time are more advan-tageous to an employee than the same personnel or pay action would have been had the new or revised wage schedule been placed into effect on the date specified by the lead agency. (c) In applying a new or revised wage schedule, the scheduled rate of pay of an employee paid at one of the steps of the employee’s grade on an old wage schedule shall be adjusted upward to the newly adjusted rate for the same numerical step of the grade whenever there is an increase in rates. Except when there is a decrease in wage rates because of a statutory reduction in scheduled rates, the employee is enti- tled to pay retention as provided in 5 CFR 536.301(a)(8).

(c) Creditable service. The following periods of time shall be considered creditable service for purposes of wait-ing periods for within-grade increases: (1) Time during which an employee is in receipt of pay, including periods of leave with pay; (2) Time during which an employee with a prearranged regular scheduled tour of duty is in a nonpay status to the extent that the time in a nonpay status does not exceed, in the aggre-gate: (i) One workweek in the waiting pe- riod for step 2; (ii) Three workweeks in the waiting period for step 3; or (iii) Four workweeks in the waiting period for steps 4 and 5; (3) Time during which an employee or former employee is on leave of absence or is separated from Federal service and is entitled to continuation of pay or compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code.

(a) When the number of hours in a nonpay status in a full-time employee’s leave year equals the number of basepay hours in a pay period, the agency shall reduce his credits for leave by an amount equal to the amount of leave the employee earns during the pay period. When the em-ployee’s number of hours of nonpay status does not require a reduction of leave credits, the agency shall drop those hours at the end of the employ-ee’s leave year.

(a) Subject to a grant of authority from OPM in consultation with OMB and all other requirements in this part, the head of an agency may fix the rate of basic pay for a critical position at a rate not less than the rate of basic pay that would otherwise be payable for the position, but not greater than— (1) The rate payable for level II of the Executive Schedule (unless paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section applies); (2) The rate payable for level I of the Executive Schedule in exceptional cir-cumstances based on information and data that justify a rate higher than the rate payable for level II of the Execu-tive Schedule; or (3) A rate in excess of the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule that is established in rare circumstances with the written approval of the Presi-dent. (b) The head of an agency may exer- cise his or her critical position pay au-thority only— (1) When such a position requires ex- pertise of an extremely high level in a scientific, technical, professional, or administrative field and is critical to the agency’s successful accomplish-ment of an important mission; and (2) To the extent necessary to recruit or retain an individual exceptionally well-qualified for the critical position.

(a) An agency may request critical position pay authority only after de-termining that the position in question cannot be filled with an exceptionally well-qualified individual through the use of other available human resources flexibilities and pay authorities. Agen-cy requests must include the informa-tion in paragraph (d) of this section. OPM, in consultation with OMB, will review agency requests. OPM will ad-vise the requesting agency as to wheth-er the request is approved and when the agency’s critical position pay au-thority becomes effective. (b) A request for critical position pay authority (or authorities) must be signed by the head of an agency and submitted to OPM. Requests covering multiple positions must include a list of the positions in priority order. The head of an agency may request cov-erage of positions of a type not listed in 5 U.S.C. 5377(a)(2), as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5377(i)(2) and Executive Order 13415. (c) Requests for critical position pay authority to set pay above the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and up to the rate for level I of the Execu-tive Schedule because of exceptional circumstances require information and data that justify the higher pay. Re-quests for critical position pay author-ity to set pay above the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule due to rare circumstances require approval by the President. The head of an agency must submit such requests to OPM with the information required in paragraph (d) of this section. If OPM, in consultation with OMB, concurs with a request to set pay above the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule, OPM will seek the President’s approval. The President may establish a maximum limitation on the critical pay rate.

The agency should also inform the employee that unless his or her performance in the critical element(s) improves to and is sustained at an ac-ceptable level, the employee may be re-duced in grade or removed. For each critical element in which the employ-ee’s performance is unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee a rea-sonable opportunity to demonstrate ac-ceptable performance, commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee’s position.

(2) If an employee has performed ac- ceptably for 1 year from the beginning of an opportunity to demonstrate ac-ceptable performance (in the critical element(s) for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to dem-onstrate acceptable performance), and the employee’s performance again be-comes unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee an additional op-portunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before determining wheth-er to propose a reduction in grade or removal under this part.

It addresses a specific scenario related to overtime compensation, which is a critical aspect of federal labor policies under Title 5. The question demonstrates a real-world concern about compensation calculations when an employee is unexpectedly called back to work, which is a common situation in many federal agencies.

The query is particularly useful for:
1. HR specialists who need to accurately calculate and process overtime pay
2. Managers planning staffing and understanding compensation implications
3. Federal employees seeking to understand their rights and compensation structure
4. Payroll administrators responsible for accurate time and wage calculations

The question touches on important aspects of federal employment regulations, including:
- Overtime compensation rules
- Scheduling and recall procedures
- Compensation calculations for unexpected work assignments

While the question is somewhat specific, it represents a practical information need that could help federal employees and managers understand their rights and obligations regarding compensation. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it might be somewhat narrow in its application, potentially not applying to all federal employment scenarios."
" What defines an ""agency"" for the purposes of restoration following a compensable injury or uniformed service?"," According to § 353.102, an agency is defined differently depending on the context:
1) For restoration following a compensable injury, it means any department, independent establishment, agency, or corporation in the executive branch (including U.S. Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission), and any agency in the legislative or judicial branch.
2) For uniformed service, it means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, excluding certain intelligence agencies, and including the U.S. Postal Service, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, and military departments.","['apply just to uniformed service and subpart C covers provisions that pertain just to injured employees. § 353.102 Definitions. In this part: Agency means. (1) With respect to restoration fol- lowing a compensable injury, any de-partment, independent establishment, agency, or corporation in the executive branch, including the U.S. Postal Serv-ice and the Postal Rate Commission, and any agency in the legislative or ju-dicial branch; and (2) With respect to uniformed service, an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 (other than an intelligence agency referred to in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii), including the U.S. Postal Service and Postal Rate Com-mission, a nonappropriated fund in-strumentality of the United States, or a military department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102. In the case of a National Guard technician employed under 32 U.S.C. 709, the employing agency is the adjutant general of the State in which the technician is employed. Fully recovered means compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to per-form all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one. Injury means a compensable injury sustained under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter 1, and in-cludes, in addition to accidental injury, a disease proximately caused by the employment. Leave of absence means military leave, annual leave, without pay (LWOP), furlough, continuation of pay, or any combination of these. Military leave means paid leave pro- vided to Reservists and members of the National Guard under 5 U.S.C. 6323. Notice means any written or verbal notification of an obligation or inten-tion to perform service in the uni-formed services provided to an agency by the employee performing the service or by the uniformed service in which the service is to be performed. Partially recovered means an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular du-ties, has recovered sufficiently to re-turn to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. Ordinarily, it is expected that a partially recovered em-ployee will fully recover eventually.

(2) The condition is considered per- manent with little likelihood for im-provement or recovery. Reasonable efforts in the case of ac- tions required by an agency for a per-son returning from uniformed service means actions, including training, that do not place an undue hardship on the agency. Service in the uniformed services means the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for train-ing, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which a person is absent from employ-ment for the purpose of examination to determine fitness to perform such duty. Status means the particular at- tributes of a specific position. This in-cludes the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working condi-tions, pay, tenure, and seniority. Undue hardship means actions taken by an agency requiring significant dif-ficulty or expense, when considered in light of— (1) The nature and cost of actions needed under this part; (2) The overall financial resources of the facility involved in taking the ac-tion; the number of persons employed at the facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of the action on the operation of the fa-cility; and (3) The overall size of the agency with respect to the number of employ-ees, the number, type, and location of its facilities and type of operations, in-cluding composition, structure, and functions of the work force. Uniformed services means the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency. § 353.103 Persons covered. (a) The provisions of this part per- taining to the uniformed services cover each agency employee who enters into such service regardless of whether the employee is located in the United States or overseas. However, an em-ployee serving under a time-limited ap-pointment completes any unexpired portion of his or her appointment upon return from uniformed service. (b) The provisions of this part con- cerning employee injury cover a civil officer or employee in any branch of the Government of the United States, including an officer or employee of an instrumentally wholly owned by the United States, who was separated or furloughed from an appointment with-out time limitation, or from a tem-porary appointment pending establish- ment of a register (TAPER) as a result of a compensable injury; but do not in-clude— (1) A commissioned officer of the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service; (2) A commissioned officer of the Re- serve Corps of the Public Health Serv-ice on active duty; or (3) A commissioned officer of the Na- tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration.

(a) This section and §§530.322 and 530.323 provide conversion rules for set-ting an employee’s pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when an employee’s coverage under an existing special rate schedule is affected by a change in coverage criteria. These con-version rules do not apply to changes in an employee’s special rate entitle-ments based on a change in the em-ployee’s position of record or official worksite. Pay-setting rules for other personnel actions affecting special rate employees are provided in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536. For example, if an em-ployee becomes covered by a special rate schedule as a result of a change in the employee’s official worksite, the geographic conversion rule in 5 CFR 531.205 must be used to set the employ-ee’s rate(s) of basic pay in the new lo-cation before considering any other si- multaneous pay action (other than a general pay adjustment). (b) The conversion rules in §§530.322 and 530.323 are considered general pay adjustments for the purpose of apply-ing 5 CFR 531.206 (dealing with the order of precedence for processing si- multaneous pay actions). The rate(s) of pay resulting from these conversion rules are considered the employee’s ex-isting rate(s) of pay before processing the next simultaneous pay action in the order of precedence. § 530.322 Setting pay when a special rate schedule is newly established or increased. (a) General rule. When an employee holds a position that becomes covered by a newly established special rate schedule (including a schedule for which coverage is expanded) or in-creased special rate schedule (including an increased special rate range within a schedule), the agency must set the employee’s special rate at the step (or relative position in range for a GM em-ployee) of the grade on the new special rate schedule that corresponds to the employee’s existing numerical step (or relative position in range for a GM em-ployee) as in effect immediately before the new special rate schedule takes ef-fect, except as otherwise provided in this section. The corresponding special rate is determined by adding the appli-cable special rate supplement on top of the employee’s GS rate, subject to the limitation that no special rate may ex-ceed the rate for level IV of the Execu-tive Schedule. For an employee receiv-ing an LEO special base rate, add the applicable special rate supplement to the GS rate for the employee’s grade and step, except as otherwise provided under §530.304(d). (b) Employee entitled to a higher rate of basic pay.

It addresses a specific technical definition within Title 5 that has significant implications for employee protections and rights. The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations, particularly those related to injury compensation and military service leave restoration. 

The definition of ""agency"" in this context is crucial because it determines the scope of restoration rights for federal employees who have been injured or have served in uniformed services. HR professionals would find this question particularly valuable for ensuring compliance with federal employment protection laws. Managers would benefit from understanding the precise legal definition to correctly implement restoration policies. Federal employees and those in uniformed services would find this information critical for understanding their rights to job reinstatement.

The technical nature of the question suggests a sophisticated information need, likely coming from someone with a deep interest in federal employment law or someone directly navigating a complex employment situation involving injury or military service. While slightly specialized, the question has broad applicability across federal employment contexts."

In all cases, the employee must establish a residence in the new geographic area before the agency may pay a relocation incentive to the employee. A relocation incen-tive may be paid only if the employee maintains residency in the new geo-graphic area for the duration of the service agreement.

(a) The Director is authorized to en- sure enforcement of the civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and all ap-plicable Executive orders, by: (1) Instructing an agency to separate or take other action against an em-ployee serving an appointment subject to investigation when the Director finds that the employee is disqualified or unsuitable for Federal employment. Where the employee or the agency ap-peals the Director’s finding that a sep-aration or other action is necessary, the Director may instruct the agency as to whether or not the employee should remain on duty and continue to receive pay pending adjudication of the appeal: Provided, That when an agency separates or takes other action against an employee pursuant to the Director’s instructions, and the Director, on the basis of new evidence, subsequently re-verses the initial decision as to the em-ployee’s qualifications and suitability, the agency shall, upon request of the Director, restore the employee to duty or otherwise reverse any action taken. (2) Reporting the results of evalua- tion or investigations to the head of the agency concerned with instructions for any corrective action necessary, in-cluding cancellation of personnel ac-tions where appropriate.

If, during the course of any evaluation or inves-tigation under this section, the Direc-tor finds evidence of matters which come within the investigative and prosecutorial jurisdiction of the Spe-cial Counsel of the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board, the Director shall refer this evidence to the Special Counsel for appropriate disposition. (b) Whenever the Director issues spe- cific instructions as to separation or other corrective action with regard to an employee, including cancellation of a personnel action, the head of the agency concerned shall comply with the Director’s instructions. (c) If the agency head fails to comply with the specific instructions of the Di-rector as to separation or other correc-tive action with regard to an employee, including cancellation of a personnel action, the Director may certify to the Comptroller General of the United States the agency’s failure to act to-gether with such additional informa-tion as the Comptroller General may require, and shall furnish a copy of such certification to the head of the agency concerned. The individual with respect to whom such separation or other corrective action was instructed shall be entitled thereafter to no pay or only to such pay as appropriate to effectuate the Director’s instructions.

SOURCE : 73 FR 58020, Oct. 6, 2008, unless otherwise noted. Subpart A—General Provisions § 295.101 Scope and purpose. (a) This part sets forth policies and procedures you must follow when you submit a demand or request to an em-ployee of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to produce official records and information, or provide testimony relating to official informa-tion, in connection with a legal pro-ceeding. You must comply with these requirements when you request the re-lease or disclosure of official records and information. (b) OPM intends these provisions to: (1) Promote economy and efficiency in its programs and operations; (2) Minimize the possibility of involv- ing OPM in controversial issues not re-lated to our functions; (3) Prevent the misuse of OPM em- ployees as involuntary expert wit-nesses for private interests or as inap-propriate expert witnesses as to the state of the law; (4) Maintain OPM’s impartiality among private litigants where neither OPM nor any other Federal entity is a named party; and (5) Protect sensitive, confidential in- formation and the deliberative proc-esses of OPM. (c) In providing for these require- ments, OPM does not waive the sov-ereign immunity of the United States. (d) This part provides guidance for the internal operations of OPM. It does not create any right or benefits, sub-stantive or procedural, that a party may rely upon in any legal proceeding against the United States. § 295.102 Applicability. This part applies to demands and re- quests to employees of OPM in legal proceedings in which OPM is not a named party, for factual or expert tes-timony relating to official information or for production of official records or information. However, it does not apply to: (a) Demands upon or requests for a current OPM employee to testify as to facts or events that are unrelated to his or her official duties or that are un-related to the functions of OPM; (b) Demands upon or requests for a former OPM employee to testify as to matters in which the former employee was not directly or materially involved while at OPM; (c) Requests for the release of records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a); and (d)']",4,"The context provides detailed information about crediting service during periods of furlough, suspension, or separation, specifically noting that full calendar time credit is given when a finding is made on or after March 30, 1966, that the furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, with some nuanced conditions about restoration and timing of the finding.",4,"This question is highly relevant to federal employment regulations under Title 5, addressing a specific and nuanced aspect of creditable service time during administrative actions like furlough, suspension, or separation. It has significant practical value for:

1. HR Specialists: They need to precisely understand how to calculate service credit in complex employment scenarios, ensuring accurate record-keeping and benefit calculations.

2. Federal Employees: Understanding how administrative actions might impact their total service time is crucial for retirement planning, career progression, and understanding their rights.

3. Managers: Knowing the conditions for service credit helps in making informed decisions about workforce management and understanding potential implications of administrative actions.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment regulations, seeking to clarify the specific conditions under which an employee can receive full calendar time credit during non-standard employment periods. This indicates a genuine need for detailed policy interpretation that goes beyond surface-level understanding.

While extremely relevant and practical, it loses one point because it might be considered a somewhat technical query that could be of more specialized interest rather than having broad, immediate applicability to all federal employees. Nevertheless, it represents an important aspect of federal employment policy that could significantly impact individual career and retirement planning."
 What requirements must an executive agency meet when conducting its annual employee survey?," According to § 250.302, each executive agency must:
1. Conduct an annual survey of employees
2. Include 16 prescribed survey questions from OPM covering areas like leadership, management practices, employee satisfaction, work environment, rewards, recognition, and professional development
3. May include additional agency-specific survey questions
4. Collect survey data by December 31 of each calendar year
5. Post survey results on their website within 120 days of survey completion, including details like survey methodology, employee sample, questions, response rates, and the agency's evaluation of results","['their agency’s progress. § 250.208 System metrics. OPM reserves the right to provide ad- ditional guidance regarding metrics. § 250.209 Consequences of improper agency actions. If OPM finds that an agency has taken an action contrary to a law, rule, regulation, or standard that OPM administers, OPM may require the agency to take corrective action. OPM may suspend or revoke a delegation agreement established under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2) at any time if it determines that the agency is not adhering to the provisions of the agreement. OPM may suspend or withdraw any authority granted under this chapter to an agen-cy, including any authority granted by delegation agreement, when OPM finds that the agency has not complied with qualification standards OPM has issued, instructions OPM has pub-lished, or the regulations in this chap-ter of the regulation. OPM also may suspend or withdraw these authorities when it determines that doing so is in the interest of the civil service for any other reason.

It touches on important aspects of workforce management and organizational communication outlined in Title 5. 

The question is practical because:
1. Annual employee surveys are a critical tool for assessing workplace climate, employee satisfaction, and organizational effectiveness
2. It seeks to understand the regulatory requirements surrounding these surveys, which is crucial for HR specialists and agency leadership
3. The information would help ensure compliance with federal guidelines for employee feedback and engagement

The question has broad applicability across federal agencies, potentially helping:
- HR professionals understand survey implementation requirements
- Managers improve their approach to employee feedback
- Employees understand their rights and the purpose of organizational surveys
- Agency leadership develop more effective workforce strategies

While not addressing a complex technical issue, the question demonstrates a substantive interest in understanding the procedural and regulatory framework for employee surveys in executive agencies. It represents a meaningful inquiry into federal workplace practices that could provide valuable insights for multiple stakeholders."
" Under what circumstances can an employee have forfeited annual leave restored, and what are the time limits for using that restored leave?"," Annual leave can be restored under several scenarios, such as administrative error, exigency of public business, or employee sickness. The time limit for using restored leave is generally by the end of the leave year two years after the date of restoration. For employees subject to specific national emergency provisions, the time limits can be more complex, with potential extensions based on the amount of excess leave and the specific circumstances of the emergency.","['West- ern Area Human Resources Management Office, Human Resources Management Di-rector, 126000 W.

(b) An agency must apply §536.105 in determining whether a position under a different covered pay system is a lower-graded position. (c) An employee’s movement to a lower-graded position is considered to be the result of reduction in force pro-cedures when the employee has re-ceived a specific reduction in force no- tice and— (1) The employee is placed in the po- sition offered in the notice; or (2) The employee is placed in a posi- tion other than that offered in the no-tice but in the same agency, if the posi-tion was offered in writing and at the initiative of management.

(b) An agency must apply §536.105 in determining whether a position under a different covered pay system is a lower-graded position. (c) When an employee is offered a po- sition with grade retention under this section in anticipation of a reduction in grade, the agency must inform the employee in writing that acceptance of the position is not required and that declination of the offer will not affect the employee’s entitlement to grade retention under §536.201 if the agency VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00586 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR577 Office of Personnel Management § 536.205 actually moves the employee to the lower-graded position.

(b) An employee is eligible for grade retention under §536.201(a)(2) based on a reclassification of his or her position only if, immediately before the reduc-tion in grade, that position was classi- fied at the existing grade or a higher grade for a continuous period of at least 1 year.

(e) The ALJ shall make a reasonable effort to dispose or all outstanding mo-tions prior to the beginning of the hearing. § 185.131 Sanctions. (a) The ALJ may sanction a person including any party or representative for the following reasons: (1) Failure to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing the pro-ceeding; (2) Failure to prosecute or defend an action; or (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, or-derly, or fair conduct of the pro-ceeding. (b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in para-graphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or mis-conduct. (c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evi-dence within the party’s control, or a request for admission, the ALJ may (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the in-formation sought; (2) In the case of requests for admis- sion, deem each matter of which an ad-mission is requested to be admitted; (3) Prohibit the party failing to com- ply with such order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise rely-ing upon, testimony relating to the in-formation sought; and (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party fail-ing to comply with such request. (d) If a party fails to prosecute or de- fend an action under this part com-menced by service of a notice of hear-ing, the ALJ may dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments. (e) The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief or other document which is not filed in a timely fashion. § 185.132 The hearing and burden of proof. (a) Where requested in accordance with §185.109 the ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to deter-mine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under §185.103 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or as-sessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors. (b) The authority shall prove defend- ant’s liability and any aggravating fac-tors by a preponderance of the evi-dence. (c) The defendant shall prove any af- firmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evi-dence. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise closed by the ALJ for good cause shown. § 185.133 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments. (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assess-ments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggra-vate the violation and should articu-late in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of inves-tigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a signifi-cant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed. (b) Although not exhaustive, the fol- lowing factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the author-ity head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct ( i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint; (1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements; (2) The time period over which such']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the restoration of forfeited annual leave under different circumstances, including administrative errors, exigencies of public business, and national emergencies, with specific time limits for using restored leave, making it possible to answer most aspects of the question comprehensively.",5,"This is an excellent, highly practical question that directly addresses a critical aspect of federal employee leave management under Title 5. The question touches on several important areas of concern for federal employees and HR professionals:

1. Relevance: It specifically addresses annual leave restoration, which is a nuanced but important policy within federal employment regulations.

2. Practicality: Many federal employees encounter situations where they might forfeit leave due to various circumstances (such as mission-critical work, agency needs, or personal challenges), so understanding restoration options is crucial.

3. Stakeholder Value:
- For Employees: Provides clarity on potential options to recover potentially lost leave
- For HR Specialists: Offers guidance on processing leave restoration requests
- For Managers: Helps understand leave management policies and employee rights

4. Complexity: The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal leave policies by asking not just about restoration, but also about time limits for using restored leave.

The question requires a detailed regulatory interpretation of Title 5, specifically addressing the conditions under which forfeited leave can be reinstated and the associated procedural constraints. It represents a genuine, substantive information need that has direct practical implications for federal workforce management."
" What happens to an employee's performance records if they are involved in an ongoing legal proceeding?
"," Per section 293.404(c), if any performance-related document is needed in connection with an ongoing administrative, negotiated, quasi-judicial, or judicial proceeding, it may be retained beyond the standard retention schedules for as long as necessary, provided it continues to be retained in the same system.","['and automated, pursu-ant to 5 U.S.C. 4303(d) must be de-stroyed after the employee completes one year of acceptable performance from the date of the written advance notice of the proposed removal or re-duction in grade notice.

(b) Performance records for Senior Executive Service appointees, includ-ing those serving under a Presidential appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), are to be retained as follows: (1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4314(b) (3) and (4), Senior Executive Service ap-pointees shall have their performance- related records maintained for five consecutive years (from the date the appraisal is issued) beginning with the effective date of appointment, includ- ing individuals receiving appointments pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3593(b). (2) When an appointee of the Senior Executive Service moves to another position in the Service, either with the same or a different agency, all appro-priate performance-related documents five years old or less shall be forwarded in the Employee Performance File along with the individual’s OPF. (3) When an employee in the Senior Executive Service accepts a Presi-dential appointment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), the employee’s perform-ance file shall be retained as long as the employee remains employed under that Presidential appointment. When the appointment ends, and the indi-vidual does not return to the Senior Executive Service, the employee’s per-formance file shall be destroyed in ac-cordance with agency procedures. (c) Where any performance-related document is needed in connection with an ongoing administrative, negotiated, quasi-judicial, or judicial proceeding, and it continues to be retained in this system rather than another system, it may be retained for as long as nec-essary beyond the retention schedules identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. (d) Screening and purging of folders/ envelopes and rating official’s work files for the purpose of compliance with these retention schedules shall be through any agency process insuring consistency with the requirements.

(c) Consistent with retention sched- ules promulgated in §293.404, destruc-tion of performance-related records shall be in accordance with agency pro-cedures (e.g., by shredding or burning). (d) If a former employee returns to an agency, a new employee perform-ance file will be created unless the prior file for this employee is still available. The original file may be re-activated provided that, consistent with the retention schedules and de-struction requirements promulgated in this subpart, the contents are properly disposed of. (e)(1) It is the responsibility of the agency Personnel Director to insure the maintenance of employee perform-ance files in accordance with this sub-part and subparts A and B of this part, part 297 of this title, and with Office of Personnel Management guidance. (2) This responsibility may be dele- gated in writing to other agency offi-cials as appropriate.

(a) The Department of Defense (DOD) will establish a flat rate pay system for nonappropriated fund (NAF) auto-motive mechanics. This flat rate pay system will take into account local prevailing rates, the mechanic’s skill level, and the standard number of hours required to complete a particular job. (b) DOD will issue special wage schedules for NAF automotive mechan-ics who are covered by the flat rate pay system. These special schedules will provide rates of pay for non-supervisory, leader, and supervisory employees. These special schedule posi-tions will be identified by pay plan codes XW (nonsupervisory), XY (lead-er), and XZ (supervisory), grades 8–10, and will use the Federal Wage System occupational code 5823. (c) DOD will issue special wage sched- ules for NAF automotive mechanics based on annual special flat rate sur-veys of similar jobs conducted in each special schedule wage area. (1) The survey area for these special surveys will include the same counties as the regular NAF survey area. (2) The survey jobs used will be Auto- motive Worker and Automotive Me-chanic. (3) The special surveys will include data on automotive mechanics that are paid under private industry flat rate pay plans as well as those paid by com-mission. (4) In addition to all standard North American Industry Classification Sys-tem (NAICS) codes currently used on the regular surveys, the industries sur- veyed will include— 2022 NAICS Codes 2022 NAICS Industry titles 441110 ....... New car dealers. 811111 ....... General automotive repair. 811191 ....... Automotive oil change and lubrication shops. (5) The surveys will cover establish- ments with a total employment of eight or more. (6) The special schedules for NAF automotive mechanics will be effective on the same dates as the regular wage schedules in the NAF FWS wage area. (d) New', 'strength and strain analysis of en-gineering materials and structures, the physical and chemical characteristics of engineering materials such as elas-tic limits, maximum unit stresses, co-efficients of expansion, workability, hardness, tendency to fatigue, resist-ance to corrosion, engineering adapt-ability, and engineering methods of construction and processing. Exempt professional engineering work includes equivalent work performed in any of the specialized branches of engineering (e.g., electrical, mechanical, or mate- rials engineering). On unusual occa-sions, engineering technicians per-forming work comparable to that per-formed by professional engineers on the basis of advanced knowledge may also be exempt. In such instances, the employee actually is performing the work of an occupation that generally requires a specialized academic degree and is performing substantially the same work as the degreed employee, but has gained the same advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual in-struction which has provided both the-oretical and practical knowledge of the specialty, including knowledge of re-lated disciplines and of new develop-ments in the field. (g) Architecture. Architects generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. Profes-sional architectural work typically re-quires knowledge of architectural prin-ciples, theories, concepts, methods, and techniques; a creative and artistic sense; and an understanding and skill to use pertinent aspects of the con-struction industry, as well as engineer-ing and the physical sciences related to the design and construction of new, or the improvement of existing, buildings. (h) Teachers. A teacher is any em- ployee with a primary duty of teach-ing, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an edu-cational establishment by which the employee is employed. (1) A teacher performs exempt work when serving, for example, as a regular academic teacher; teacher of kinder-garten or nursery school pupils; teach-er of gifted or disabled children; teach-er of skilled and semi-skilled trades and occupations; teacher engaged in automobile driving instruction; air-craft flight instructor; home economics teacher; or vocal or instrumental music instructor. A faculty member who is engaged as a teacher but also spends a considerable amount of time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic teams or acting as a moderator or advisor in such areas as drama, speech, debate, or journalism is engaged in teaching.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 551.209 are a recognized part of an educational establishment’s responsibility in con-tributing to the educational develop-ment of the student. An instructor in an institution of higher education or another educational establishment whose primary duty is teaching, tutor-ing, instructing, or lecturing in the ac-tivity of imparting knowledge is also an exempt teacher. (2) The possession of an elementary or secondary teacher’s certificate pro-vides a clear means of identifying the individuals contemplated as being within the scope of the exemption for teaching professionals. Teachers who possess a teaching certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the ter-minology (e.g., permanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or unlimited) used by ap-propriate certifying entities. However, a teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for post-secondary edu-cational establishments. (3) Exempt teachers do not include teachers of skilled and semi-skilled trade, craft, and laboring occupations when the paramount knowledge is the knowledge of and the ability to per-form the trade, craft, or laboring occu-pation. Conversely, if the primary re-quirement of the post-secondary edu-cation instructor is the ability to in-struct, as opposed to knowledge of and ability to perform a trade, craft, or la-boring occupation, then the position may be exempt. (4) Section 551.203 (Salary-based non- exemption) does not apply to the em-ployees described in this section. (i) Medical technologists. Registered or certified medical technologists who have successfully completed 3 aca-demic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university, plus a 4th year of professional course work in a school of medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical As-sociation, generally meet the duties re-quirements for the learned professional exemption. (j) Nurses. Registered nurses who are registered by the appropriate State ex-amining board generally meet the du-ties requirements for the learned pro-fessional exemption. Licensed practical nurses and other similar health care employees, however, generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because possession of a specialized ad-vanced academic degree is not a stand-ard prerequisite for entry into such oc-cupations. (k) Dental hygienists. Dental hygien- ists who have successfully completed 4 academic years of pre-professional and professional study in an accredited col-lege or university approved by the Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational Pro-grams of the American Dental Associa-tion generally meet the duties require-ments for the learned professional ex-emption. (l) Physician assistants. Physician as- sistants who have successfully com-pleted 4 academic years of pre-profes-sional and professional study, includ-ing graduation from a physician assist-ant program accredited by the Accredi-tation Review Commission on Edu-cation for the Physician Assistant, and who are certified by the National Com-mission on Certification of Physician Assistants, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned profes-sional exemption. (m) Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced, specialized academic de-gree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess general 4-year ad-vanced degrees, most specialized para-legal programs are 2-year associate de-gree programs from a community col-lege or equivalent institution. How-ever, the learned professional exemp-tion is applicable to paralegals who possess advanced, specialized degrees in other professional fields and apply advanced knowledge in that field in the performance of their duties. In addi-tion, a paralegal who fails to meet the professional exemption criteria may be performing exempt administrative work, e.g., overseeing a full range of support services for a large legal office. § 551.209 Creative professionals.

The work performed must be ‘‘in a recog-nized field of artistic or creative en-deavor,’’ including such fields as music, writing, acting, and the graphic arts. The exemption does not apply to work which can be produced by a person with general manual or intellectual ability and training.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 530.205 in §530.205. The previous employing agency must provide a fund transfer equal to the total cost of the lump-sum payment to the gaining agency through the Department of the Treas-ury’s Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection System. If an employee leaves Federal service, the employing agency is responsible for making the lump-sum payment to the employee as provided in paragraph (d) of this sec-tion. (d) An agency must pay any excess amount regardless of the calendar year limitation under the following condi-tions: (1) If an employee dies, the employ- ing agency must pay the entire excess amount as part of the settlement of ac-counts, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5582. (2) If an employee separates from Federal service, the employing agency must pay the entire excess amount fol-lowing a 30-day break in service. If the individual is reemployed in the Federal service within the same calendar year as the separation, any previous pay-ment of an excess amount must be con-sidered part of that year’s aggregate compensation for the purpose of apply-ing the aggregate limitation for the re-mainder of the calendar year. § 530.205 Records. An agency must maintain appro- priate records to administer this sub-part and must transfer such records to any agency to which an employee may transfer. An agency must make such records available to any agency that may employ the employee later during the same calendar year. An agency’s records must document the source of any deferred excess amount remaining to the employee’s credit at the time of separation from the agency. In the case of an employee who separates from Federal service for at least 30 days, the agency records also must document any payment of a deferred excess amount made by the agency after sepa-ration. Subpart C—Special Rate Sched- ules for Recruitment and Re-tention SOURCE : 70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, unless otherwise noted. GENERAL PROVISIONS § 530.301 Purpose and applicability. (a) Purpose. This subpart contains OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5305, which authorizes the estab-lishment of special rates of pay for Federal employees in executive agen-cies to address significant recruitment or retention problems. This subpart also contains rules for determining an employee’s rate of pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when conditions for coverage under a special rate schedule are changed. All other pay actions for special rate employees are governed by the pay-setting rules in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536. (b) Applicability. Except as explained in §530.303(a), this subpart applies only to GS employees. § 530.302 Definitions. In this subpart: Agency means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. Authorized agency official means the head of the agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned. Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105. General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also re-fers to the pay schedule of GS rates es-tablished under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as ad-justed under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM em-ployees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classifica-tion and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. GM employee has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203. GS rate means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00408 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR399 Office of Personnel Management § 530.302 any LEO special base rate and addi- tional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate. Highest applicable rate range means the rate range applicable to an employ-ee’s position that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any re-tained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates may exceed an applica-ble locality rate range. In certain cir-cumstances, the highest applicable rate range may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules— e.g., a range where special rates (based on a fixed dollar supplement) are high-er in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range. Law enforcement officer or LEO has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103. LEO special base rate means a special base rate established for GS law en-forcement officers at grades GS–3 through GS–10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101– 509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate. Locality payment has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.602. Locality rate means a GS rate or an LEO special base rate, if applicable, plus any applicable locality payment. Official worksite means the official lo- cation of an employee’s position of record as determined under 5 CFR 531.605. Official worksite is synonymous with the term ‘‘official duty station’’ as used in 5 U.S.C. 5305(i). OPM means the Office of Personnel Management. Pay schedule means a set of rate ranges established for GS employees under a single authority— i.e., the Gen- eral Schedule, an LEO special base rate schedule (for grades GS–3 through 10), a locality rate schedule based on GS rates, a locality rate schedule based on LEO special base rates (for grades GS– 3 through 10), a special rate schedule under this subpart, or a similar sched-ule under 38 U.S.C. 7455. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established cov-erage conditions (e.g., official work-site, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an em- ployee who meets the established cov-erage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record.

It touches on critical aspects of performance management, record-keeping, and legal proceedings within the federal workplace. The question is practical because performance records can be sensitive during legal disputes, and understanding their treatment is crucial for maintaining transparency, protecting employee rights, and ensuring proper documentation. 

HR specialists would find this particularly useful for understanding how to manage personnel files during legal proceedings, while employees would want to know how their performance records might be handled or protected. The question suggests a real-world scenario where an employee's performance documentation could be subject to legal scrutiny, which is a common concern in federal employment contexts.

The query demonstrates a substantive information need related to Title 5 regulations concerning employee records, performance management, and legal processes. It goes beyond a surface-level inquiry and seeks to understand the procedural implications of legal proceedings on an employee's official documentation. While not covering the most critical aspect of federal employment regulations, it nonetheless represents an important nuanced concern that could have significant practical implications for federal employees and HR management."
" Can an agency pay a student-employee a stipend that exceeds the prescribed maximum amount, and if so, under what conditions?
"," According to section (b) of the policy, an agency may pay a student-employee a stipend in excess of the prescribed maximum amount only if the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has specifically determined that a higher maximum stipend is warranted for that particular student-employee. This suggests that such an increase is not automatic and requires individual review and approval by OPM.","['be set by the agency, subject to the maximum stipends prescribed in the following table: M AXIMUM STIPENDS PRESCRIBED Code symbol Academic level of approved training program Maximums by grade and step1 L-A .........................................

This amount includes overtime pay, maintenance allowances, and other payments in money or kind.

Subpart C—Basic Pay for Employ- ees of Temporary Organiza-tions SOURCE : 67 FR 3582, Jan. 25, 2002, unless otherwise noted. § 534.301 Purpose. This subpart provides rules for deter- mining the rate of basic pay and local-ity-adjusted rate of basic pay for em-ployees who are appointed to positions in temporary organizations and com-pensated under 5 U.S.C. 3161. Such tem-porary organizations are established by law or Executive order. This subpart does not provide authority to establish other forms of compensation and bene-fits not authorized by title 5, United States Code, or another specific statu-tory authority. [67 FR 63049, Oct. 10, 2002] § 534.302 Coverage. This subpart applies to employees in executive level and staff positions in temporary organizations. Such employ-ees are not subject to the provisions applicable to General Schedule employ-ees covered by chapter 51 and sub-chapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code. [67 FR 63049, Oct. 10, 2002] § 534.303 Basic pay for executive level positions. Rates of basic pay for executive level positions of temporary organizations may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. [69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004] § 534.304 Basic pay for staff positions. (a)(1) Rates of basic pay for staff or other non-executive level positions of temporary organizations may not ex- ceed the maximum rate of basic pay for grade GS–15 of the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, excluding any lo-cality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304. (2) In establishing rates of basic pay for staff and other non-executive level positions of temporary organizations, the head of a temporary organization must give consideration to the signifi-cance, scope, and technical complexity of the position and the qualifications required for the work involved. The head of a temporary organization must also take into account the rates of pay applicable to Federal employees who have duties that are similar in terms of difficulty and responsibility. (b) Employees in staff and other non- executive level positions of temporary organizations must be paid locality payments in addition to basic pay in the same manner as employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 5304. Locality-adjusted rates of basic pay may not exceed the locality-adjusted rate of basic pay for grade GS–15 of the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304, for the locality pay area involved (not to exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule). (c) Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sec-tion, the rate of basic pay and locality- adjusted rate of basic pay for a senior staff position of a temporary organiza-tion may, in a case determined by the head of a temporary organization to be exceptional, exceed the maximum rates established under those paragraphs. However, the higher payable rates may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.

It demonstrates a nuanced inquiry about potential exceptions to standard compensation rules, which would be particularly valuable for:

1. HR Specialists: Provides critical guidance on legal limits and potential exceptions for student employee compensation
2. Managers: Helps understand constraints and potential flexibility in student hiring and compensation
3. Educational Institutions with Federal Partnerships: Clarifies compensation boundaries for student workers
4. Student Employees: Offers insight into potential compensation structures

The question shows a sophisticated understanding that compensation rules may have exceptions, and seeks to understand the specific conditions under which those exceptions might apply. It's not a simple yes/no query, but seeks deeper regulatory interpretation.

The practicality is high, as student employment is a common scenario in federal agencies, particularly in research, administrative support, and internship programs. Understanding the precise compensation rules is crucial for both employers and students.

While not receiving a perfect 5 rating, this question represents a sophisticated, targeted inquiry into a specific aspect of federal employment regulations that has direct, actionable implications for multiple stakeholders."

Current rating of record is the rating of record for the most recently com-pleted appraisal period as provided in §351.504(b)(3). Days means calendar days. Function means all or a clearly iden- tifiable segment of an agency’s mission (including all integral parts of that mission), regardless of how it is per-formed. Furlough under this part means the placement of an employee in a tem-porary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year. Local commuting area means the geo- graphic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the sur-rounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to trav-el back and forth daily to their usual employment. Modal rating is the summary rating level assigned most frequently among the actual ratings of record that are: (1) Assigned under the summary level pattern that applies to the employee’s position of record on the date of the re-duction in force; (2) Given within the same competi- tive area, or at the agency’s option within a larger subdivision of the agen-cy or agencywide; and (3) On record for the most recently completed appraisal period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices or the cutoff date the agency specifies prior to the issuance of reduc-tion in force notices after which no new ratings will be put on record. Rating of record has the meaning given that term in §430.203 of this chap-ter. For an employee not subject to 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43, or part 430 of this chapter, it means the officially des-ignated performance rating, as pro-vided for in the agency’s appraisal sys-tem, that is considered to be an equiva-lent rating of record under the provi-sions of §430.201(c) of this chapter. Reorganization means the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organiza-tion. Representative rate means: (1) The fourth step of the grade for a position covered by the General Sched-ule, using the locality rate authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5304 and subpart F of part 531 of this chapter for General Schedule positions; (2) The prevailing rate for a position covered by a wage-board or similar wage-determining procedure, such as provided in the definition of represent-ative rate for Federal Wage System po-sitions in 5 CFR 532.401 of this chapter; (3) For positions in a pay band, the rate (or rates) the agency designates as representative of that pay band or competitive levels within the pay band, including (as appropriate) any applica-ble locality payment authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5304 and subpart F of part 531 of this chapter (or equivalent payment under other legal authority); and (4) For other positions (e.g., positions in an unclassified pay system), the rate the agency designates as representa-tive of the position, including (as ap-propriate) any applicable locality pay-ment authorized by subpart F of part 531 (or equivalent payment under other legal authority).

Undue interruption means a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the em-ployee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allow-able limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands.

(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the official worksite is the location of an employee’s position of record where the employee regularly performs his or her duties. (2) If the employee’s work involves recurring travel or the employee’s work location varies on a recurring basis, the official worksite is the loca-tion where the work activities of the employee’s position of record are based, as determined by the employing agency, subject to the requirement that the official worksite must be in a locality pay area in which the em-ployee regularly performs work. (3) An agency must document an em- ployee’s official worksite on an em-ployee’s Notification of Personnel Ac-tion (Standard Form 50 or equivalent). (b) For an employee who is relocated and authorized to receive relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. chapter 57, sub-chapter II (or similar authority), the official worksite is the established worksite for the position in the area to which the employee has been relocated. For an employee authorized to receive relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. 5737 in connection with an extended assign-ment resulting in a temporary change of station, the worksite associated with the extended assignment is the of-ficial worksite. (See 41 CFR 302–1.1.) (c) For an employee whose assign- ment to a new worksite is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s sepa-ration before he or she is required to report for duty at the new location, the official worksite in effect immediately before the assignment remains the offi- cial worksite through the date of sepa-ration. (d) For an employee covered by a telework agreement, the following rules apply: (1) If the employee is scheduled to work at least twice each biweekly pay period on a regular and recurring basis at the regular worksite for the employ-ee’s position of record, the regular worksite (where the employee’s work activities are based) is the employee’s official worksite. However, in the case of such an employee whose work loca-tion varies on a recurring basis, the employee need not work at least twice each biweekly pay period at the reg-ular official worksite (where the em-ployee’s work activities are based) as long as the employee is regularly per-forming work within the locality pay area for that worksite. (2) An authorized agency official may make an exception to the twice-in-a- pay-period standard in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in appropriate situa-tions of a temporary nature, such as the following: (i) An employee is recovering from an injury or medical condition; (ii) An employee is affected by an emergency situation, which tempo-rarily prevents the employee from commuting to his or her regular offi-cial worksite; (iii) An employee has an extended ap- proved absence from work (e.g., paid leave); (iv) An employee is in temporary duty travel status away from the offi-cial worksite;', 'provisions of subpart B of this part.

(a) OPM will determine when there is a critical hiring need for particular oc-cupations, grades (or equivalent) and/or geographic locations. OPM may decide independently that such a need exists or may make this decision in response to a written request from an agency. (b) An agency when requesting di- rect-hire authority under this section, or OPM when deciding on its own, must: (1) Identify the position(s) that must be filled; (2) Describe the event or cir- cumstance that has created the need to fill the position(s); (3) Specify the duration for which the critical need is expected to exist; and (4) Include supporting evidence that demonstrates why the use of other hir-ing authorities is impracticable or in- effective. (c) Information Technology (IT) posi- tions. (1) The head of a covered agency, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may determine whether a crit-ical hiring need exists for any position in the information technology manage-ment series, general schedule (GS)–2210 or equivalent. In making such a deter-mination, a covered agency must ad-here to and use the supporting evidence criteria prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. In addition, a covered agency must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for docu-mentation and reporting purposes. Upon determination of such a finding, an agency head may approve a direct hire authority for covered positions within the agency. (2) Covered agency. A covered agency is an entity listed in 31 U.S.C. 901(b) (excluding the Department of Defense), or an independent regulatory agency defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5). (3) Notification to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Once the head of a covered agency affirmatively determines the presence of a critical hiring need and the direct hire author-ity is approved by the agency head, he or she must notify OPM within 10 busi-ness days. Such notification must in-clude a description of the supporting evidence relied upon in making the de-termination. (4) Using this authority. A covered agency must adhere to all provisions of subpart B of this part. (5) Length of appointments. A covered agency may use this authority to ap-point individuals for a period of more than 1 year, but not more than 4 years, if the direct hire authority remains in effect.

(a) Termination and modification. On a periodic basis, for each direct-hire au-thority, OPM will review agency use of the authority to ensure proper admin-istration and to determine if continued use of the authority is supportable. OPM will terminate or modify a direct- hire authority if it determines that there is no longer a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need. Likewise, when an agency finds there are adequate numbers of qualified can-didates for positions previously filled under direct-hire authorities, based on severe shortage of candidates, the agency is required to report this change of events to OPM. OPM may also terminate an agency’s authority when the agency has used an authority improperly. (b) Extension. OPM may extend di- rect-hire authority if OPM determines, based on relevant, recent, and support-able data, that there is or will continue to be a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need for particular po-sitions as of the date the authority is due to expire. In their requests for ex-tensions of direct-hire authorities, agencies must include an update of the supporting evidence that demonstrated the need for the original authority. (c) Reporting requirement. On a peri- odic basis, OPM may request informa-tion from agencies regarding their use of these direct-hire authorities. The re-quested information may include num-bers of positions, title, series, and grade of positions advertised under the direct-hire authority, the number of qualified applicants, the specific quali-fication criteria, and the number of ap-plicants appointed under the authority.

This subpart implements the cat- egory rating and selection procedures at 5 U.S.C. 3319. This law authorizes agencies with delegated examining au-thority under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2) to de-velop a category rating method as an alternative process to assess applicants for jobs filled through competitive ex-amining. § 337.302 Definitions. In this subpart: (a) Category rating is synonymous with alternative rating as described at 5 U.S.C. 3319, and is a process of evalu-ating qualified eligibles by quality cat-egories rather than by assigning indi-vidual numeric scores. The agency as-sesses candidates against job-related criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined categories. (b) Quality categories are groupings of individuals with similar levels of job- related competencies or similar levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities. § 337.303 Agency responsibilities. To use a category rating procedure, agencies must: (a) Establish a system for evaluating applicants that provides for two or more quality categories; (b) Define each quality category through job analysis conducted in ac-cordance with the ‘‘Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures’’ at 29 CFR part 1607 and part 300 of this chap-ter. Each category must have a clear', 'the basic eligibility re- quirements (including employment suitability requirements under part 731 of this chapter and any medical quali-fication requirements), qualification standards (including minimum edu-cational and experience requirements), and any applicable selective factors; (2) Is physically qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential duties of the po-sition; (3) Meets any special qualifying con- ditions of the position; (4) Is able to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position upon entry; and (5) At agency discretion, either: (i) Rates at or above specified level(s) on all quality ranking factors; or (ii) Rates above minimally qualified in the agency’s rating and ranking process. § 330.705 Applying ICTAP selection priority. (a) An agency must not appoint any candidate from outside its permanent competitive service workforce if there is an ICTAP selection priority can-didate available for the vacancy, unless the personnel action to be effected is an exception under §330.707. (b) ICTAP selection priority applies to a vacancy that: (1) Is at a grade or pay level with a representative rate no higher than the representative rate of the grade or pay level of the ICTAP eligible’s current or last permanent position of record; (2) Has no greater promotion poten- tial than the ICTAP eligible’s current or last permanent position of record; (3) Is in the same local commuting area as the ICTAP eligible’s current or last permanent position of record; and (4) Is filled during the ICTAP eligi- ble’s eligibility period. (c) An agency may appoint any ICTAP selection priority candidate for a vacancy. (d)(1) After an agency announces the vacancy and meets its obligation to any ICTAP selection priority can-didates, the agency may appoint any other candidate from outside its cur-rent permanent competitive service workforce, under appropriate staffing procedures. (2) An agency may make additional selections or reissue selection certifi-cates in accordance with its merit pro-motion program without readvertising for ICTAP eligibles only if the addi-tional selections are made from the ap-plicant pool established by the original vacancy announcement, including re-advertisements for the same vacancy, under which ICTAP eligibles had an op-portunity to apply. (e) An agency may deny an ICTAP el- igible future selection priority for va-cancies in that agency if the ICTAP el-igible: (1) Declines an offer of a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service; or (2) Fails to respond within a reason- able period of time, as defined by the agency, to an offer or official inquiry of availability for a permanent ap-pointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service. (f) An agency may deny an ICTAP el- igible future selection priority for a po-sition previously obtained through ICTAP if the eligible was terminated or removed from that position under part 432 or 752 of this chapter. § 330.706 Other agency ICTAP respon- sibilities.

(b) In accordance with the conditions of part 300, subpart E, of this chapter, an agency may not procure temporary help services under that subpart until a determination is made that no ICTAP eligible is available. (c) An agency must announce all va- cancies it intends to fill from outside its permanent competitive service workforce. Vacancy announcements must meet the requirements of subpart A of this part. (d) An agency must provide an ICTAP eligible who applied for a spe-cific vacancy written notice of the final status of his or her application, including whether the eligible was de-termined to be well-qualified. The agency notice must include the results of the independent second review under §330.703(b), if applicable; whether an-other ICTAP selection priority can-didate was hired; whether the position was filled under an exception listed in §330.707; and whether the recruitment was cancelled. § 330.707 Exceptions to ICTAP selec- tion priority.

(b) An agency must make the deter- mination to pay a recruitment incen-tive before the prospective employee enters on duty in the position for which recruited. § 575.109 Payment of recruitment in- centives. (a) An authorized agency official must establish the criteria for deter-mining the amount of a recruitment incentive. An agency may pay a re-cruitment incentive-(1) As an initial lump-sum payment at the commence-ment of the service period required by the service agreement or before the start of the service period, as author- ized by paragraph (d) of this section; (2) In installments throughout the service period required by the service agreement; (3) As a final lump-sum payment upon the completion of the full service period required by the service agree-ment; or (4) In a combination of these pay- ment methods. (b)(1) Except as provided in para- graph (c) of this section, the total amount of recruitment incentive pay-ments paid to an employee in a service period may not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the em-ployee at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including fractions of a year) in the service period (not to exceed 4 years). (2) For hourly rate employees who do not have a scheduled annual rate of basic pay, compute the annual rate re-quired for paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion by multiplying the applicable hourly rate in effect at the beginning of the service period by 2,087 hours. (3) For the purpose of determining the number of years in a service period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, divide the total number of calendar days in the service period by 365 and round the result to two decimal places. For example, a service period covering 39 biweekly pay periods equals 546 days, and 546 days divided by 365 days equals 1.50 years. (c)(1) An authorized agency official may request that OPM waive the limi-tation in paragraph (b)(1) of this sec- tion for an employee or group of em-ployees based on a critical agency need. The authorized agency official must determine that the competencies required for the position(s) are critical to the successful accomplishment of an important agency mission, project, or initiative (e.g., programs or projects related to a national emergency or im-plementing a new law or critical man-agement initiative).

For HR professionals, this definition is essential for correctly implementing workforce management policies and communicating with employees during challenging organizational periods. The question directly addresses a key Title 5 topic related to employment status, workforce management, and administrative procedures. It has broad applicability across federal agencies and can help prevent misunderstandings about temporary work suspensions, compensation, and employment continuity. The technical nature of seeking the OPM's specific regulatory definition indicates a serious, professional information need that goes beyond casual curiosity and seeks authoritative guidance."
" How does an agency determine additional retention service credit for performance during a reduction in force when an employee has fewer than three performance ratings?
"," Per §351.504(c), the process depends on the number of ratings received:
1. No ratings in 4-year period: Employee receives credit based on the modal rating for their position's summary level
2. One rating received: The value of that single rating becomes the additional retention service credit
3. Two ratings received: The values are added together and divided by two, with fractions rounded up to the next whole number

The specific credit is calculated based on the summary level:
- Level 5 (Outstanding): 20 years additional service
- Level 4: 16 years additional service
- Level 3 (Fully Successful): 12 years additional service","['to sign a writ-ten service agreement to complete a specified period of employment with the agency. (3) In no event, may the service pe- riod under a service agreement estab-lished under this paragraph extend past the date on which the employee’s posi-tion is actually affected by the reloca-tion or closure of the employee’s office, facility, activity, or organization (e.g., the date the employee’s position moves to a new geographic location or the date the employee’s position is elimi-nated). (4) In addition to the terminating conditions in §575.310(d) and (e), the service agreement must include the conditions under which the agency must terminate the service agreement under paragraph (g) of this section, in- cluding the conditions under which the agency will pay an additional retention incentive payment for partially com-pleted service under §575.311. (5) The service agreement must in- clude a notification to the employee that the agency will review the deter-mination to pay the retention incen-tive at least annually to determine whether payment is still warranted, as VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00762 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR753 Office of Personnel Management § 575.314 required by paragraph (g) of this sec- tion. (g) Termination of retention incentives. (1) The provisions in §575.311 regarding termination of retention incentive service agreements and paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(4) of this section apply to the termination of retention incentives authorized under this sec-tion. Each determination to pay a re-tention incentive under this section must be reviewed at least annually to determine if payment is still war-ranted. An authorized agency official must certify this determination in writing. (2) In addition to the terminating conditions in §575.311(a) and (b), an au-thorized agency official must termi-nate a retention incentive service agreement under this section if— (i) The closure or relocation is can- celled or no longer affects the employ-ee’s position; (ii) The employee moves to another position not affected by the closure or relocation (including another position within the same agency); (iii) For relocation situations, the employee accepts the agency’s offer to relocate with his or her the office, fa-cility, activity, or organization and, thus, the employee is no longer likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service; or (iv) The employee moves to a dif- ferent position in the same office, facil-ity, activity, or organization subject to closure or relocation that is not cov-ered by the employee’s service agree-ment. In this situation, the agency may authorize a new retention incen-tive for the employee under this sec-tion, as appropriate. (3) If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this sec-tion in cases in which the employee’s movement to another position is by management action and not at the em-ployee’s request or under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the employee is entitled to retain any retention incen-tive payments that are attributable to completed service and to receive any portion of a retention incentive pay-ment owed by the agency for completed service. (4) If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement in ter-mination actions under paragraph (g)(2) of this section that are not cov-ered by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the employee is entitled to retain re-tention incentive payments previously paid by the agency that are attrib-utable to the completed portion of the service period. If the employee received retention incentive payments that are less than the amount that would be at-tributable to the completed portion of the service period, the agency is not obligated to pay the employee the amount attributable to completed service, unless the agency agreed to such payment under the terms of the retention incentive service agreement. (h) Monitoring requirements. The mon- itoring requirements in §575.312 apply to retention incentives authorized under this section. (i) Records and reports. In addition to the recordkeeping requirements in §575.313, each agency must submit a written report to OPM by March 31 of each year on the use of retention in-centives under this section. Each re-port must include— (1) A description of how the author- ity to pay retention incentives under this section was used in the agency during the previous calendar year; (2) The number and dollar amount of retention incentives paid during the previous calendar year to individuals under this section by occupational se-ries and grade, pay level, or other pay classification; (3) The agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, legislative branch) to which each employee would be like-ly to leave in the absence of a reten-tion incentive; (4) Each employee’s official worksite and the geographic location of the agency (which may be in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch) for which each employee would be likely to leave in the absence of a retention incentive; and (5) Other information, records, re- ports, and data as OPM may require.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 575.401 Subpart D—Supervisory Differentials SOURCE : 56 FR 20338, May 3, 1991, unless otherwise noted. § 575.401 Purpose. This subpart provides regulations to implement 5 U.S.C. 5755, which author-izes payment of a supervisory differen-tial to an employee under the General Schedule who has supervisory responsi-bility for one or more civilian employ-ees not under the General Schedule if one or more of the subordinate civilian employees would, in the absence of such a differential, be paid more than the supervisory employee. § 575.402 Delegation of authority. (a) The head of an agency may pay a supervisory differential to a supervisor who is— (1) In a General Schedule position paid under 5 U.S.C. 5332; and (2) Responsible for providing direct, technical supervision over the work of one or more civilian employees whose positions are not under the General Schedule if the continuing pay (as de-termined under §575.405(d) of this part) of one or more of the subordinates would, in the absence of such a dif-ferential, be more than the continuing pay (as determined under §575.405(c) of this part) of the supervisor. (b) A supervisory differential may not be paid on the basis of supervising a civilian employee whose rate of basic pay exceeds the maximum rate of basic pay established for grade GS–15 on the pay schedule applicable to the GS su-pervisor, including a schedule for any applicable special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; locality-based com-parability payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; or similar payment or supplement', 'health) of the employee or the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the paid parental leave, but, in the case of the employ-ee’s serious health condition, only if the condition is related to the applica-ble birth or placement; or (ii) Any other circumstance beyond the employee’s control, subject to paragraph (h) of this section. (g) Medical certification. An agency’s determination not to apply the reim-bursement requirement may be condi-tioned upon the employee’s supplying of a health care provider certification supporting the employee’s claim that a serious health condition described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) is causing the em-ployee to be unable return to work for the required 12 weeks. In cases where an agency’s determination regarding whether to apply the reimbursement requirement relies on a health condi-tion that is not related to the applica-ble birth or placement or that applies to a person not covered by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the agency may also require a medical certification. An agency may require additional exami-nations and certification from other health care providers if it deems it nec-essary, but any such additional exami-nations must be at the agency’s ex-pense. (h) Circumstances beyond employee’s control. The circumstances beyond the employee’s control referenced in para-graph (f)(2)(ii) of this section must be ones that truly preclude an employee from returning to work with the em-ploying agency. Examples of situations beyond the employee’s control include such situations as where a parent chooses to stay home because a child has a serious health condition or an employee moves because the employ-ee’s spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles from the employee’s worksite. Matters of employee preference or convenience will not suffice. For example, a situa-tion where an employee chooses not to return to work to stay home with a well, newborn child would not con-stitute a circumstance beyond the em-ployee’s control for purposes of this ex-ception.

The employing agency that employed the employee at the time use of paid parental leave con-cluded is responsible for informing any other affected agency of the employee’s failure to complete the required 12 weeks of work and of its determination regarding application of the reimburse-ment requirement. Any other affected agency will make its own determina-tion regarding application of the reim-bursement requirement associated with agency employment. (j) Agency policies on applying the re- imbursement requirement. Each agency is responsible for adopting its own set of policies governing when it will or will not apply the reimbursement require-ment described in paragraph (f) of this section. A single agency-wide set of policies should be in place so that em-ployees within an agency are treated consistently. (k) Collection of reimbursement. The re- imbursement requirement described in paragraph (f) of this section, if im-posed, is subject to collection as a debt owed to the affected agency. (See the Federal Claims Collection Standards in 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.) § 630.1706 Cases of employee incapaci- tation. (a) If an agency determines that an otherwise eligible employee who could have made an election during a past pe-riod to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in §630.1703) and enter a work obligation agreement (as de-scribed in §630.1705) was physically or mentally incapable of doing so during that past period, the employee may, within 5 workdays of the employee’s return to duty status, make an elec-tion to substitute paid parental leave for applicable FMLA unpaid leave under §630.1703(a) on a retroactive basis. Such a retroactive election shall be effective on the date that such an election would have been effective if the employee had not been incapaci-tated at the time. Consistent with §630.1206(f)(4), this retroactive election must be made in conjunction with a retroactive election under §630.1203(b), if the FMLA unpaid leave was not al-ready approved. As part of such elec-tion, the employee must agree (in writ-ing, as described in §630.1705(b)(1)) to meet the work obligation or pay the re-quired reimbursement (if applicable) unless— (1) Applying the work obligation and the associated reimbursement require-ment is barred under §630.1705(f)(2); or (2) The agency later concludes under its policies established under §630.1705(f)(1) that the circumstances support a determination to not apply the reimbursement requirement. (b)(1) If an agency determines that an otherwise eligible employee is phys-ically or mentally incapable of making an election to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in §630.1703) and en-tering into a work obligation agree-ment (as described in §630.1705), the agency must, upon the request of a per-sonal representative of the employee whom the agency finds acceptable, pro-vide conditional approval of substi-tution of paid parental leave for appli-cable FMLA unpaid leave under §630.1703(a) on a prospective basis. The conditional approval is based on the presumption that the employee would have elected to substitute paid paren-tal leave for the applicable FMLA un-paid leave and would have entered into the work obligation agreement if the employee had not been incapacitated. Within 5 workdays after returning to work, the employee must enter into a written agreement to meet the work obligation described in §630.1705 or pay the required reimbursement (if applica-ble) unless— (i) Applying the work obligation and the associated reimbursement require-ment is barred under §630.1705(f)(2); or (ii) The agency later concludes under its policies established under §630.1705(f)(1) that the circumstances support a determination to not apply the reimbursement requirement.

Data on non-Federal salary rates may be sup-plemented, if appropriate, by data on Federal salary rates for comparable po-sitions established under a non-GS pay system; and (10) The level of any locality pay au- thorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and any nonforeign area cost-of-living allow-ance authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1) for the area involved. (b) In determining the level at which to set special rates, OPM may consider the following factors: (1) The pay levels that, in OPM’s judgment, are necessary to recruit or retain an adequate number of qualified employees based on OPM’s findings with respect to the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; (2) The dollar costs that will be in- curred if special rates are not author-ized; (3) The level of pay for comparable positions; and (4) The need to provide for a reason- able progression in pay from lower grade levels to higher grade levels to avoid pay alignment problems (e.g., such as might result from applying the two-step promotion rule in 5 U.S.C. 5334(b)). (c) No one factor or combination of factors specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section requires OPM to estab-lish or increase special rates or to set special rates at any given level.

An authorized agency official may request that OPM conduct such a review of one or more special rate schedules. (b) OPM may designate lead agencies to assist in the review of designated special rate schedules and to coordi-nate the collection of relevant data. Each affected agency is responsible for submitting complete supporting data upon request to OPM or the lead agen-cy, as appropriate. (c) OPM will adjust a special rate schedule by determining the amount of the special rate supplement to be paid on top of the current GS rate for each rate range within the schedule. OPM will determine the extent to which spe-cial rate supplements are to be ad-justed (increased or decreased), if at all, and when the special rate supple-ments are to be adjusted. As provided in 5 U.S.C. 5305(d), special rate schedule adjustments made by OPM have the force and effect of statute. (d)(1) For special rate schedules com- puted by applying a fixed-percentage supplement on top of each GS rate within a rate range, OPM may require that a change in the underlying GS rate automatically results in an ad-justed special rate schedule, unless OPM determines that an adjustment in the supplement percentage is appro-priate for one or more special rate schedules. (2) For special rate schedules com- puted by applying a fixed-dollar supple-ment on top of each GS rate within a rate range, OPM may require that spe-cial rate supplements generally be ad-justed to reflect the increase in GS rates, unless OPM determines that a different adjustment is appropriate for one or more special rate schedules. (e) If OPM determines that a special rate schedule, or a rate range within a special rate schedule, is no longer needed to ensure satisfactory recruit-ment or retention of qualified employ-ees, OPM may discontinue the schedule or rate range. Consistent with §530.303(d), if all employees and posi-tions covered by a special rate schedule or rate range are entitled to a higher rate of basic pay, the schedule or rate range (as applicable) will be automati-cally discontinued. (f) OPM may change the established conditions for coverage under a special rate schedule at any time based on a reevaluation of the circumstances and factors that led to establishing the schedule. Expansion of coverage is equivalent to establishing a special rate schedule for a category of affected employees. Reduction of coverage is the equivalent of discontinuing a spe-cial rate schedule for a category of af-fected employees. (g) When a special rate schedule is adjusted or discontinued, or when there is a change in a schedule’s coverage criteria, the rate of pay for affected employees must be set as provided in §§530.321 through 530.323. § 530.308 Treatment of special rate as basic pay. Except as otherwise specifically pro- vided under other legal authority, a special rate is considered a rate of basic pay only for the following pur-poses: (a) The purposes for which a locality rate is considered to be a rate of basic pay in computing other payments or benefits to the extent provided by 5 CFR 531.610, except as otherwise pro-vided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; (b) Computation of foreign area post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925(a) and danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5928; and (c) Application of pay administration provisions for prevailing rate employ-ees which consider rates of basic pay under the GS pay system in setting pay (except as otherwise provided in 5 CFR part 532), subject to the requirement that, if the employee’s actual special rate would not apply at the official worksite for the prevailing rate posi-tion, a special rate may be used only if it is a corresponding special rate', 'in a re-duction in force. (2) For employees who received rat- ings of record while covered by part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those ratings of record shall be used to grant additional retention service credit in a reduction in force. (3) For employees who received per- formance ratings while not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those performance ratings shall be con-sidered ratings of record for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force only when it is de- termined that those performance rat-ings are equivalent ratings of record under the provisions of §430.201(c) of this chapter. The agency conducting the reduction in force shall make that determination. (b)(1) An employee’s entitlement to additional retention service credit for performance under this subpart shall be based on the employee’s three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices, except as otherwise provided in para-graphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section. (2) To provide adequate time to de- termine employee retention standing, an agency may provide for a cutoff date, a specified number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings of record will be put on record and used for purposes of this subpart. When a cutoff date is used, an employee will receive performance credit for the three most recent ratings of record re-ceived during the 4-year period prior to the cutoff date. (3) To be creditable for purposes of this subpart, a rating of record must have been issued to the employee, with all appropriate reviews and signatures, and must also be on record ( i.e., the rating of record is available for use by the office responsible for establishing retention registers). (4) The awarding of additional reten- tion service credit based on perform-ance for purposes of this subpart must be uniformly and consistently applied within a competitive area, and must be consistent with the agency’s appro-priate issuance(s) that implement these policies. Each agency must speci-fy in its appropriate issuance(s): (i) The conditions under which a rat- ing of record is considered to have been received for purposes of determining whether it is within the 4-year period prior to either the date the agency issues reduction in force notices or the agency-established cutoff date for rat-ings of record, as appropriate; and (ii) If the agency elects to use a cut- off date, the number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force no-tices after which no new ratings of VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00285 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR276 5 CFR Ch.

Additional reten- tion service credit for employees who do not have three actual ratings of record during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices or the 4-year period prior to the agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record permitted in para-graph (b)(2) of this section shall be de-termined under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, as appropriate, and as fol-lows: (1) An employee who has not received any rating of record during the 4-year period shall receive credit for perform-ance based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that applies to the employee’s official position of record at the time of the reduction in force. (2) An employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record during the 4-year pe-riod shall receive credit for perform-ance on the basis of the value of the ac-tual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received. If an employee has received only two actual ratings of record during the period, the value of the ratings is added together and divided by two (and rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) to determine the amount of additional retention service credit. If an employee has received only one actual rating of record during the period, its value is the amount of additional retention service credit pro-vided. (d) Single rating pattern. If all employ- ees in a reduction in force competitive area have received ratings of record under a single pattern of summary lev-els as set forth in §430.208(d) of this chapter, the additional retention serv-ice credit provided to employees shall be expressed in additional years of service and shall consist of the mathe-matical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the employee’s applicable ratings of record, under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section computed on the following basis: (1) Twenty additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 5 (Outstanding or equivalent) summary; (2) Sixteen additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 4 summary; and (3) Twelve additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) sum-mary. (e) Multiple rating patterns. If an agen- cy has employees in a competitive area who have ratings of record under more than one pattern of summary levels, as set forth in §430.208(d) of this chapter, it shall consider the mix of patterns and provide additional retention serv-ice credit for performance to employ-ees expressed in additional years of service in accordance with the fol-lowing: (1) Additional years of service shall consist of the mathematical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the additional retention service credit that the agency established for the sum-mary levels of the employee’s applica-ble rating(s) of record. (2) The agency shall establish the amount of additional retention service credit provided for summary levels only in full years; the agency shall not establish additional retention service credit for summary levels below Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent). (3) When establishing additional re- tention service credit for the summary levels at Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) and above, the agency shall establish at least 12 years, and no more than 20 years, additional retention service credit for a summary level. (4) The agency may establish the same number of years additional reten-tion service credit for more than one summary level. (5) The agency shall establish the same number of years additional reten-tion service credit for all ratings of record with the same summary level', 'denies records or a waiver of fees under the Freedom of Information Act, the re-quester may appeal to the— Office of the General Counsel, Office of Per- sonnel Management, Washington, DC 20415 (b) A person may appeal denial of a Freedom of Information Act request for information maintained by OPM’s Office of the General Counsel to the— Deputy Director, Office of Personnel Man- agement Washington, DC 20415 (c) If an official of another agency de- nies a Freedom of Information Act re-quest for records in one of OPM’s Gov-ernment-wide systems of records, the requester should consult that agency’s regulations for any appeal rights that may apply.

It addresses a specific and nuanced aspect of performance evaluation and retention rights during organizational restructuring. The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of Title 5 regulations related to performance management and workforce reduction strategies.

The query is particularly useful because:
1. It focuses on a complex procedural issue that directly impacts employee job security
2. It requires detailed knowledge of performance rating requirements and RIF regulations
3. It would be critically important for HR professionals managing workforce transitions
4. It helps employees understand how their performance might influence retention during organizational changes

The technical nature of the question suggests it comes from someone with a deep interest in or professional experience with federal employment policies. While slightly technical, it represents a genuine information need that could help employees and managers navigate challenging workforce reduction scenarios. The specificity of asking about performance ratings with fewer than three evaluations indicates a sophisticated understanding of the potential complexities in federal employment regulations."
" What happens to a recruitment incentive service agreement if an employee is separated for cause or receives a performance rating below ""Fully Successful""?
"," Per §575.111(b), an authorized agency official must terminate a recruitment incentive service agreement if:
1. The employee is demoted or separated for cause
2. The employee receives a rating of record less than ""Fully Successful"" or equivalent
3. The employee otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement

In such cases, according to §575.111(f), the employee is only entitled to retain recruitment incentive payments previously paid that are attributable to the completed portion of the service period. If the payments received exceed the amount attributable to completed service, the employee must repay the excess amount, unless the agency officially waives this requirement.","['an existing aggregate rate in the new position such as he would have re-ceived had he occupied that position VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00624 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR615 Office of Personnel Management § 550.182 when the agency elected to make sec- tion 5545(c) applicable to it. PAY FOR SUNDAY WORK § 550.171 Authorization of pay for Sun- day work. (a) An employee is entitled to pay at his or her rate of basic pay plus pre-mium pay at a rate equal to 25 percent of his or her rate of basic pay for each hour of Sunday work (as defined in §550.103). (b) An employee is not entitled to Sunday premium pay while engaged in training, except as provided in §410.402 of this chapter.

(a) Premium pay for Sunday work is in addition to premium pay for holiday work, overtime pay, or night pay dif-ferential payable under this subpart and is not included in the rate of basic pay used to compute the pay for holi-day work, overtime pay, or night pay differential. (b) For a Border Patrol agent covered by 5 U.S.C. 5550 and subpart P of this part, no Sunday premium pay is pay-able for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the agent’s regular tour of duty, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5550(b)(2)(C), (b)(3)(C), and (c)(1)(A). The overtime supplement payable for such scheduled overtime hours is not part of the agent’s rate of basic pay used in computing the Sunday premium pay for other hours that qualify for such premium pay.

(b) Any Office of Inspector General that employs fewer than five criminal investigators may elect not to cover such criminal investigators under the availability pay provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5545a. [64 FR 4520, Jan. 29, 1999] § 550.182 Unscheduled duty. (a) Unscheduled Duty Hours. For the purpose of availability pay, unsched-uled duty hours are those hours during which a criminal investigator performs work, or (except for a special agent in the Diplomatic Security Service) is de-termined by the employing agency to be available for work, that are not— (1) Part of the 40-hour basic work- week of the investigator; or (2) Regularly scheduled overtime hours compensated under 5 U.S.C. 5542 and §550.111. (b) Regularly Scheduled Overtime Hours. For criminal investigators re- ceiving availability pay, regularly scheduled overtime hours compensated under 5 U.S.C. 5542 and §550.111 are those overtime hours scheduled in ad-vance of the investigator’s administra-tive workweek, excluding— (1) The first 2 hours of overtime work on any day containing a part of the in-vestigator’s basic 40-hour workweek, as required by §550.111(f)(1)); or (2) The first 2 hours of overtime work performing protective duties author-ized by section 3056(a) of title 18, United States Code, or section 2709(a)(3) of title 22, United States Code, on any day containing a part of the investigator’s basic 40-hour work-week, unless the investigator performs 2 or more consecutive hours of un-scheduled overtime work on that same day.

To be consid- ered available for work under para-graph (a) of this section, a criminal in-vestigator must be determined by the employing agency to be generally and reasonably accessible to perform un-scheduled duty based on the needs of the agency. Generally, the agency will place the investigator in availability status by directing the investigator to be available during designated periods to meet agency needs, as provided by agency policies and procedures. Plac-ing the investigator in availability sta-tus is not considered scheduling the in-vestigator for overtime hours com-pensated under 5 U.S.C. 5542 and §550.111. Availability hours may in-clude hours during which an investi-gator places himself or herself in avail-ability status to meet the needs of the agency, subject to agency policies and procedures (including any require-ments for after-the-fact validation or approval). A special agent in the Diplo-matic Security Service may not be credited with availability hours and will be credited with only hours actu-ally worked. (e) Ensuring availability. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, an employing agency shall ensure that each criminal investiga-tor’s hours of unscheduled duty are suf-ficient to enable the investigator to meet the substantial hours require-ment in §550.183 and make the certifi-cation required under §550.184. (f) Voluntary opt-out. Notwith- standing paragraph (d) of this section, an employing agency may, at its dis-cretion, approve a criminal investiga-tor’s voluntary request that the inves-tigator generally be assigned no over-time work (including unscheduled duty) for a designated period of time because of a personal or family hard-ship situation. The investigator must sign a written statement documenting this request and his or her under-standing that availability pay will not be payable during the designated pe-riod. (g) When availability pay is suspended. The employing agency is not subject to the requirement of paragraph (d) of this section in the case of a criminal investigator for whom availability pay is suspended in accordance with §550.184(d) due to denial or cancellation of the required certification based on— (1) Failure to perform unscheduled duty as assigned or reported; or (2) Inability to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period because of a physical or health condition.

Once the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record have been met, a rat-ing of record shall be prepared as soon as practicable. (h) Each rating of record shall cover a specified appraisal period. Agencies shall not carry over a rating of record prepared for a previous appraisal period as the rating of record for a subsequent appraisal period(s) without an actual evaluation of the employee’s perform-ance during the subsequent appraisal period. (i) When either a regular appraisal period or an extended appraisal period ends and any agency-established dead-line for providing ratings of record passes or a subsequent rating of record is issued, an agency shall not produce or change retroactively a rating of record that covers that earlier ap-praisal period except that a rating of record may be changed— (1) Within 60 days of issuance based upon an informal request by the em-ployee; (2) As a result of a grievance, com- plaint, or other formal proceeding per-mitted by law or regulation that re-sults in a final determination by appro-priate authority that the rating of record must be changed or as part of a bona fide settlement of a formal pro- ceeding; or (3) Where the agency determines that a rating of record was incorrectly re-corded or calculated.

Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, provides for the establishment of Senior Executive Service (SES) performance appraisal systems and appraisal of senior execu-tive performance. This subpart pre-scribes regulations for managing SES performance to implement the statu-tory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 4311–4315. (b) Purpose. In order to improve the overall performance of Government, agencies must establish performance management systems that hold senior executives accountable (within their assigned areas of responsibility and control) for their individual perform-ance and for organizational perform-ance by— (1) Encouraging excellence in senior executive performance; (2) Aligning executive performance plans with the results-oriented goals required by the Government Perform-ance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) or other stra-tegic planning initiatives; (3) Setting and communicating indi- vidual and organizational goals and ex-pectations that clearly fall within the executive’s area of responsibility and control; (4) Reporting on the success of meet- ing organizational goals (including any factors that may have impacted suc-cess); (5) Systematically appraising senior executive performance using measures that balance organizational results with customer and employee perspec-tives, and other perspectives as appro-priate; and (6) Using performance appraisals as a basis for pay, awards, development, re-tention, removal, and other personnel decisions.

This subpart applies to— (a) All senior executives covered by subchapter II of chapter 31 of title 5, United States Code; and (b) Agencies as defined in §430.303. § 430.303 Definitions. In this subpart— Agency means an agency as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(1) and an Office of Inspector General, which is a separate agency for all provisions of the Senior Executive Service under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App 6(d)). Annual summary rating means the overall rating level that an appointing authority assigns at the end of the ap-praisal period after considering (1) the initial summary rating, (2) any input from the executive or a higher level re-view, and (3) the applicable Perform-ance Review Board’s recommendations. This is the official final rating for the appraisal period. Appointing', 'the length of a service period. The service period may not be less than 6 months and may not exceed 4 years. (b)(1) The service agreement must in- clude the commencement and termi-nation dates of the required service pe-riod. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the re-quired service period must begin upon the commencement of service with the agency. The service period must termi- nate on the last day of a pay period. (2) If service with the agency does not begin on the first day of a pay pe-riod, the agency must delay the service period commencement date so that a required service period begins on the first day of the first pay period begin-ning on or after the commencement of service in the agency. (3) An agency may delay a service agreement commencement date until after the employee completes an initial period of formal training or required probationary period when continued employment in the position is contin-gent on successful completion of the formal training or probationary period. The agency must make the determina-tion to pay a recruitment incentive be-fore the employee enters on duty in the position. However, the service agree-ment must specify that if an employee does not successfully complete the training or probationary period before the service period commences, the agency is not obligated to pay any por-tion of the recruitment incentive to the employee. (c) The service agreement must specify the total amount of the incen-tive, the method of paying the incen-tive, and the timing and amounts of each incentive payment, as established under §575.109. (d) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency must terminate the service agreement ( i.e., if an employee is de- moted or separated for cause, receives a rating of record of less than ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equivalent, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement) and the conditions under which the employee must repay a re-cruitment incentive under §575.111. (e) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency may terminate the service agreement before the employee com-pletes the agreed-upon service period. The service agreement must specify the effect of a termination under §575.111, including the conditions under which the agency will pay an addi-tional recruitment incentive payment for partially completed service under §575.111(e) and (f).

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 575.111 (f) The service agreement may in- clude any other terms or conditions that, if violated, will result in termi-nation of the service agreement under §575.111(b). For example, the service agreement may specify the employee’s work schedule, type of position, and the duties he or she is expected to per-form. In addition, the service agree-ment may address the extent to which periods of time on detail, in a nonpay status, or in a paid leave status are creditable towards the completion of the service period. § 575.111 Termination of a service agreement. (a) An authorized agency official may unilaterally terminate a recruitment incentive service agreement based sole-ly on the management needs of the agency. For example, an agency may terminate a service agreement when the employee’s position is affected by a reduction in force, when there are in-sufficient funds to continue the planned incentive payments, or when the agency assigns the employee to a different position (if the different posi-tion is not within the terms of the service agreement). (b) An authorized agency official must terminate a recruitment incen-tive service agreement if an employee is demoted or separated for cause ( i.e., for unacceptable performance or con-duct), if the employee receives a rating of record (or an official performance appraisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 CFR part 430) of less than ‘‘Fully Suc-cessful’’ or equivalent, or if the em-ployee otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement. (c) The termination of a service agreement is not grievable or appeal-able. (d) The agency must notify an em- ployee in writing when it terminates a recruitment incentive service agree-ment. (e) If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement under paragraph (a) of this section, the em-ployee is entitled to all recruitment in-centive payments that are attributable to completed service and to retain any portion of a recruitment incentive pay-ment he or she received that is attrib- utable to uncompleted service. (f) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, if an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, the employee is entitled to re-tain recruitment incentive payments previously paid by the agency that are attributable to the completed portion of the service period. If the employee received recruitment incentive pay-ments that are less than the amount that would be attributable to the com-pleted portion of the service period, the agency is not obligated to pay the em-ployee the amount attributable to completed service, unless the agency agreed to such payment under the terms of the recruitment incentive service agreement. If the employee re-ceived recruitment incentive payments in excess of the amount that would be attributable to the completed portion of the service period, he or she must repay the excess amount, except when an authorized agency official waives the requirement to repay the excess amount under paragraph (h) of this sec-tion. (g) If an employee fails to reimburse the paying agency for the full amount owed under paragraph (f) of this sec-tion, the amount outstanding must be recovered from the employee under the agency’s regulations for collection by offset from an indebted Government employee under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, or through the ap-propriate provisions governing Federal debt collection if the individual is no longer a Federal employee. (h) If an employee received recruit- ment incentive payments in excess of the amount that would be attributable to the completed portion of the service period under paragraph (f) of this sec-tion, an authorized agency official may waive the requirement to repay the ex-cess amount when, in the judgment of the official, collection of the excess amount would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best in-terest of the United States.

The question touches on recruitment incentives, performance standards, and potential consequences of employment termination, which are critical concerns for both HR specialists and federal employees.

The question is particularly useful because:
1. It addresses a nuanced scenario involving recruitment incentives and performance standards
2. It provides insight into potential financial and contractual implications of job performance
3. It helps both employees and HR professionals understand the risks and obligations associated with recruitment incentive service agreements
4. It requires a clear understanding of performance management policies and incentive contract terms
5. The scenario is realistic and represents a genuine concern for federal employees and managers

HR specialists would find this question valuable for understanding how to manage recruitment incentive agreements, while employees would benefit from knowing the potential consequences of underperformance or termination. The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the complex interplay between recruitment incentives, performance evaluations, and employment status in the federal workplace."

A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reas-signed, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examina-tion, subject to the conditions pre-scribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. (d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary ap-pointment: Provided, that an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive serv-ice as long as he continues to occupy such position.

(b) Annual leave donated to an emer- gency leave transfer program may not be applied against the limitations on the donation of annual leave under the voluntary leave transfer or leave bank programs established under 5 U.S.C. 6332 and 6362, respectively. § 630.1111 Limitation on the amount of donated annual leave received by an emergency leave recipient. An emergency leave recipient may receive a maximum of 240 hours of do-nated annual leave at any one time from an emergency leave transfer pro-gram for each disaster or emergency. After taking into consideration the amount of donated annual leave avail-able to all approved emergency leave recipients and the needs of individual emergency leave recipients, an employ-ing agency may allow an employee to receive additional disbursements of do-nated annual leave based on the em-ployee’s continuing need. Each dis-bursement of transferred annual leave may not exceed 240 hours. § 630.1112 Transferring donated an- nual leave between agencies. (a) If an agency does not receive suf- ficient amounts of donated annual leave to meet the needs of approved emergency leave recipients within the agency, the agency may contact OPM to obtain assistance in receiving do-nated annual leave from other agen-cies. The agency must notify OPM of the total amount of donated annual leave needed for transfer to the agen-cy’s approved emergency leave recipi-ents. OPM will solicit and coordinate the transfer of donated annual leave from other Federal agencies to affected agencies who may have a shortfall of donated annual leave. OPM will deter-mine the period of time for which dona-tions of accrued annual leave may be accepted for transfer to affected agen-cies. (b) Each Federal agency OPM con- tacts for the purpose of providing do-nated annual leave to an agency in need must— (1) Approve emergency leave donors under the conditions specified in §§630.1109 and 630.1110 and determine how much donated annual leave is available for transfer to an affected agency; (2) Maintain records on the amount of annual leave donated by each emer- gency leave donor to the emergency leave transfer program (for the purpose of restoring unused transferred annual leave under §630.1117(b)). (3) Report the total amount of annual leave donated to the emergency leave transfer program to OPM; and (4) When OPM has accepted the do- nated annual leave, debit the amount of annual leave donated to the emer-gency leave transfer program from each emergency leave donor’s annual leave account. (c) OPM will notify each affected agency of the aggregate amount of do-nated annual leave that will be cred-ited to it for transfer to its approved emergency leave recipient(s). The af-fected agency will determine the amount of donated annual leave to be transferred to each emergency leave recipient (an amount that may vary according to individual needs). (d) The affected agency must credit the annual leave account of each ap-proved emergency leave recipient as soon as possible after the date OPM no-tifies the agency of the amount of do-nated annual leave that will be cred-ited to the agency under paragraph (c) of this section. § 630.1113 Using donated annual leave. (a) Any donated annual leave an emergency leave recipient receives from an emergency leave transfer pro-gram may be used only for purposes re-lated to the disaster or emergency for which the emergency leave recipient was approved. Each agency is respon-sible for ensuring that annual leave do-nated under the emergency leave trans-fer program is used appropriately. (b) Annual leave transferred under this subpart may be— (1) Substituted retroactively for any period of leave without pay used be-cause of the adverse effects of the dis-aster or emergency; or VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00888 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR879 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1117 (2) Used to liquidate an indebtedness incurred by the emergency leave re-cipient for advanced annual or sick leave used because of the adverse ef-fects of the disaster or emergency. The agency may advance annual or sick leave, as appropriate (even if the em-ployee has available annual and sick leave), so that the emergency leave re-cipient is not forced to use his or her accrued leave before donated annual leave becomes available. § 630.1114 Accrual of leave while using donated annual leave. While an emergency leave recipient is using donated annual leave from an emergency leave transfer program, an-nual and sick leave continue to accrue to the credit of the employee at the same rate as if he or she were in a paid leave status under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter I, and will be subject to the limitations imposed by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), (c), and (f) at the end of the leave year in which the transferred annual leave is received. § 630.1115 Limitations on the use of donated annual leave. Donated annual leave transferred to a leave recipient under this subpart may not be— (a) Included in a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. 5551 or 5552; (b) Recredited to a former employee who is reemployed by a Federal agen-cy; or (c) Used to establish initial eligi- bility for immediate retirement or ac-quire eligibility to continue health benefits into retirement under 5 U.S.C. 6302(g). § 630.1116 Termination of a disaster or emergency. The disaster or emergency affecting the employee as an emergency leave recipient terminates at the earliest oc-currence of the following conditions. (a) When the employing agency de- termines that the disaster or emer-gency has terminated; (b) When the employee’s Federal service terminates; (c) At the end of the biweekly pay pe- riod in which the employee, or his or her personal representative, notifies the emergency leave recipient’s agency that he or she is no longer affected by such disaster or emergency; (d) At the end of the biweekly pay pe- riod in which the employee’s agency determines, after giving the employee or his or her personal representative written notice and an opportunity to answer orally or in writing, that the employee is no longer affected by such disaster or emergency; or (e) At the end of the biweekly pay pe- riod in which the', 'time an employee otherwise would be in a duty status. (f) Approval of absences. Any absence during obligated overtime hours (as de-scribed in paragraphs (a)(8) and (b)(8) of this section) is subject to management approval under CBP policies. § 550.1622 Circumstances requiring special treatment. (a) General. The rules in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provide for special treatment based on specified circumstances and apply notwith-standing any other provision of this subpart. (b) Advanced training. (1) During the first 60 days of advanced training in a calendar year, an agent’s assigned reg-ular tour of duty must be considered to continue and the agent must be deemed to have worked during any nonwork period within obligated overtime hours for the purpose of determining the agent’s total hours to be compared to the applicable overtime threshold (as provided in §550.1623(a)(2)(iv)), except VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00693 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR684 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 550.1623 as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (2) If an agent, during the period cov- ered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, performs creditable overtime work out-side the agent’s regular tour of duty on a day when the agent performed less than the required amount of obligated overtime work, the overtime work out-side the regular tour of duty must be applied towards the obligated overtime hours, as provided in §550.1626(b). After any such substitution, CBP must credit the agent with hours of work for any remaining nonwork time during obli-gated overtime hours on the same day for the purpose of determining the agent’s total hours to be compared to the applicable overtime threshold. For example, if an agent performs 2 cred-itable hours of regularly scheduled overtime work outside the agent’s Level 1 regular tour of duty on a train-ing day when the agent performed half an hour of work during the 2 hours of obligated overtime, CBP would sub-stitute 1.5 hours of regularly scheduled overtime outside the regular tour of duty for 1.5 hours of obligated overtime when no work was performed. CBP would not provide the agent with any credit for nonwork hours under para-graph (b)(1) of this section, since the 0.5 hours of actual work plus the 1.5 sub-stituted hours account for the entire 2- hour period. The agent would be paid for the unsubstituted half hour of cred-itable regularly scheduled overtime work under §550.1624. (3) For days of advanced training in excess of 60 days in a calendar year, an agent must be assigned a Basic regular tour of duty and be treated accord-ingly. If this results in a hybrid pay pe-riod in which an agent has two types of regular tours of duty within the same biweekly pay period, CBP must deter-mine the number of overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty as pro-vided in §550.1623(c). For an agent who is assigned a Basic regular tour of duty during advanced training under this paragraph, CBP must change the agent’s regular tour of duty to the type in effect before the Basic tour was as-signed when the agent is no longer par-ticipating in advanced training. (4) Paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section apply solely to advanced training that is provided in whole- workday increments ( i.e., covering an entire 8-hour basic workday). (c) Canine care. (1) For an agent as- signed to provide care for a canine and assigned to the Level 1 regular tour of duty border patrol rate of pay, the combined sum of basic pay plus the 25 percent overtime supplement is consid-ered to provide compensation for all canine care. Such an agent must be credited with 1 hour of regularly sched-uled overtime work as part of the reg-ular tour of duty on each day con-taining a part of that tour, without re-gard to the actual duration of such care or the time and day when such care was actually provided. That leaves the agent with an additional obligation to perform 1 other hour of regularly scheduled overtime work as part of the agent’s regular tour of duty on any day containing a part of the employee’s tour, if the agent performs work during regular time on that day and thus has obligated overtime hours. An agent may receive no other compensation or compensatory time off for hours of ca-nine care beyond what is specifically provided under this paragraph. (2) If an agent is generally assigned to provide care for a canine, but is tem-porarily relieved of that duty for any reason (e.g., no dog available), the agent may not receive the 1-hour credit for canine care on a day when the agent is relieved from providing canine care. If the period during which the agent is temporarily relieved from pro-viding canine care lasts more than two full pay periods, CBP must assign the agent’s tour based on the agent’s de-fault election for the annual period as provided in §550.1611(c) or (d) unless other circumstances described in para-graph (f) of §550.1611 are applicable. For shorter periods, the Level 1 regular tour of duty assigned based on canine care responsibilities will continue un-less the agent requests a different tour based on the agent’s default election for the annual period. § 550.1623 Overtime work outside the regular tour of duty.

An agent’s total hours of work (as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) must be compared to the applicable threshold, and hours in ex-cess of that threshold are overtime hours in applying §§550.1624, 550.1625, and 550.1626. The 8-hour daily and 40- hour weekly overtime thresholds under 5 U.S.C. 5542(a) and §550.111 are not ap-plicable to agents. (2) An agent’s total hours of work in a pay period for the purpose of apply-ing applicable overtime thresholds is equal to the sum of: (i) Time determined to be hours of work in duty status (regular time or overtime), subject to this subpart, 5 U.S.C. 4109 and 5 CFR 410.402 (related to training periods), and 5 U.S.C. 5542(b) and §550.112 (establishing general rules), except that paragraphs (d) and (e) of §550.112 are superseded by §550.1626; (ii) Paid leave or other paid time']",5,"The context provides a precise definition of eligible student loans in §537.102, specifically listing loans made, insured, or guaranteed under parts B, D, or E of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as well as health education assistance loans made or insured under parts A and E of titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act.",4,"This question is highly relevant and practical for federal employees, HR specialists, and potential job candidates.

It would help individuals understand their eligibility for loan repayment assistance, assist HR professionals in explaining benefits to current and prospective employees, and provide clarity on the types of student loans that qualify under the program. The specificity of the question indicates a genuine information need that has direct practical applications in federal employment contexts. While not applicable to all federal employees, it is a valuable resource for those seeking to understand this particular benefit program."
" What is competitive status, and how can an individual acquire it in the federal competitive service?
"," According to § 212.301, competitive status means an individual's basic eligibility for noncompetitive assignment to a competitive position. An individual can acquire competitive status through three primary methods:
1. Completion of a probationary period under a career-conditional or career appointment following an open competitive examination
2. Completion of a probationary period under a career executive assignment in the former executive assignment system
3. Acquisition by statute, Executive order, or Civil Service rules, without open competitive examination

Once an individual has competitive status, they may be reinstated, transferred, promoted, reassigned, or demoted without open competitive examination, subject to Civil Service rules and regulations.","['the competitive service.

(b) Prior Federal civilian service (in- cluding nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of probation when the prior service: (1) Is in the same agency, e.g., De- partment of the Army; (2) Is in the same line of work (deter- mined by the employee’s actual duties and responsibilities); and (3) Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days. (c) Periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of pro-bation. Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compen-sable injury or military duty) is cred-itable up to a total of 22 workdays. Ab-sence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the proba-tionary period by an equal amount. An employee serving probation who leaves Federal service to become a volunteer with the Peace Corps or the Corpora-tion for National and Community Serv-ice serves the remainder of the proba-tionary period upon reinstatement pro-vided the employee is reinstated within 90 days of termination of service as a volunteer or training for such service.

(b) Termination of an individual serving a probationary period must be taken in accordance with subpart D of part 752 of this chapter if the indi-vidual has completed one year of cur-rent continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less and is not otherwise excluded by the provisions of that sub-part.

(a) Subject to §315.803(b), when an agency decides to terminate an em-ployee serving a probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to dem-onstrate his fitness or his qualifica-tions for continued employment, it shall terminate his services by noti-fying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action.

Subpart B—Reemployment Priority List (RPL) § 330.201 Purpose. (a) The Reemployment Priority List (RPL) is a required component of an agency’s placement programs to assist its current and former competitive service employees who will be or were separated by reduction in force (RIF) under part 351 of this chapter, or who have recovered from a compensable work-related injury after more than 1 year, as required by part 353 of this chapter. In filling vacancies, an agency must give its RPL registrants place- ment priority for most competitive service vacancies before hiring some-one from outside its own permanent competitive service workforce. An agency may choose to consider RPL placement priority candidates before other agency permanent competitive service employees under its Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) es-tablished under subpart F of this part, after fulfilling agency obligations to its CTAP selection priority candidates. (b) Agencies must use an RPL to give placement priority to their: (1) Current competitive service em- ployees with a specific notice of RIF separation or a Certification of Ex-pected Separation issued under part 351 of this chapter; (2) Former competitive service em- ployees separated by RIF under part 351 of this chapter; and (3) Former competitive service em- ployees fully recovered from a compen-sable injury (as defined in part 353 of this chapter) after more than 1 year. (c) All agency components within the local commuting area use a single RPL and are responsible for giving place-ment priority to the agency’s RPL reg-istrants. (d) With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate place-ment program which satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart, including veterans’', 'chal-lenging tasks in a particular field be-yond the usual range of achievement of competent persons in that field. An ex-pert is regarded by other persons in the field as an authority or practitioner of unusual competence and skill in a pro-fessional, scientific, technical or other activity. (e) An expert position is one that re- quires the services of a specialist with skills superior to those of others in the same profession, occupation, or activ-ity to perform work on a temporary and/or intermittent basis assigned by a Federal official. For example, a micro-bial contamination specialist may apply new test methods to identify bac-teria on products, a computer scientist may adapt advanced methods to de-velop a complex software system, or a plate maker may engrave a novel de-sign. (f) Intemittent employment, as defined in part 340, subpart D, of this chapter, means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty. (g) Temporary employment means em- ployment not to exceed 1 year. An ex-pert or consultant serving under a tem-porary appointment may have a full- time, part-time, seasonal, or intermit-tent work schedule. (h) Employment without compensation means unpaid service that is provided at the agency’s request and is to per-form duties that are unclassified. It is not volunteer service. § 304.103 Authority. (a) Basic authority. (1) When author- ized by an appropriation or other stat-ute to use 5 U.S.C. 3109, an agency may appoint a qualified expert or consult-ant to an expert or consultant position that requires only intermittent and/or temporary employment. Such an ap-pointment is excepted from competi-tive examination, position classifica-tion, and the General Schedule pay rates. (2) An expert or consultant who works on a strictly intermittent basis may be appointed under this authority without time limit or for any period determined by the agency. All other experts and consultants must receive temporary appointments. Temporary experts and consultants may be re-appointed in the same agency only as provided in paragraph (c) of this sec-tion. (b) Inappropriate use. An agency must not use 5 U.S.C. 3109 to appoint an ex-pert or consultant: (1) To a position requiring Presi- dential appointment. However, subject to the conditions of this part, an agen-cy may appoint an individual awaiting final action on a Presidential appoint-ment to an expert or consultant posi-tion. (2) To a Senior Executive Service po- sition (including an FBI or DEA Senior Executive Service position). (3) To perform managerial or super- visory work (although an expert may act as team leader or director of the specific project for which he/she is hired), to make final decisions on sub-stantive policies, or to otherwise func-tion in the agency chain of command (e.g., to approve financial transactions, personnel actions, etc.). (4) To do work performed by the agency’s regular employees. (5) To fill in during staff shortages. (6) Solely in anticipation of giving that individual a career appointment. However, subject to the conditions of this part, an agency may appoint an in-dividual to an expert or consultant po-sition pending Schedule C appointment or noncareer appointment in the Sen-ior Executive Service. (c) Reappointment. An agency may re- employ an expert or consultant to per-form demonstrably different duties without regard to the length of that in-dividual’s previous expert or consult-ant service with the agency. Re-appointment to perform substantially the same duties is subject to the fol-lowing limits: (1) An agency may employ an expert or consultant who works on a full-time basis for a maximum of 2 years— i.e., on an initial appointment not to exceed 1 VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00166 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR157 Office of Personnel Management § 304.105 year and a reappointment not to ex- ceed 1 additional year. (2) An agency may reappoint an ex- pert or consultant who works on a part-time or intermittent schedule in accordance with one of the following options. The agency must determine which option it will use in advance of any reappointment and must base its determination on objective criteria (e.g., nature of duties, pay level, whether or not work is regularly sched-uled). Option 1 must be applied to re-appointments of experts and consult-ants appointed without compensation. (i) Option 1—Annual service. An agen- cy may reappoint an expert or consult-ant, with no limit on the number of re-appointments, as long as the individual is paid for no more than 6 months (130 days or 1,040 hours) of work, or works for no more than that amount of time without compensation, in a service year. (The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the in-dividual’s initial appointment in the agency.) An expert or consultant who exceeds this limit in his/her first serv-ice year may be reappointed for 1 addi-tional year. An expert or consultant who exceeds the limit during any sub-sequent service year may not be re-appointed thereafter. (ii) Option 2—Cumulative earnings. Each expert or consultant will have a lifetime limit of twice the maximum annual rate payable under the annualized basic pay limitations of sec-tion 304.105. The agency may adjust this limit to reflect statutory increases in basic pay rates. The agency may re-appoint an expert or consultant until his/her total earnings from expert or consultant employment with the agen-cy reach the lifetime maximum, as de-termined by using the applicable max-imum salary rate. At that point, the employment must be terminated. (3) OPM may authorize reappoint- ment of an expert or consultant as an exception to the limits in the section when necessitated by unforeseen and unusual circumstances. § 304.104 Determining rate of pay. (a) The rate of basic pay for experts and consultants is set by administra-tive action. The head of an agency, or his or her designee, must determine the appropriate rate of basic pay on an hourly or daily basis, subject to the limitations described in section 304.105. (b) The head of an agency, or his or her designee, shall consider the fol-lowing factors in setting the initial rate of basic pay for an expert or con-sultant: (1) The level and difficulty of the work to be performed; (2) The qualifications of the expert or consultant; (3) The pay rates of comparable indi- viduals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors; and (4) The availability of qualified can- didates. (c) An expert or consultant appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3109 may be employed without pay, provided the individual agrees in advance in writing to waive any claim for compensation for those services. § 304.105 Daily and biweekly basic pay limitations. (a) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, agencies subject to chapter 51 and']",4,"The context provides a detailed definition of competitive status and multiple ways an individual can acquire it, including completing a probationary period under a career-conditional or career appointment, through open competitive examination, or by statute, Executive order, or Civil Service rules, making it possible to answer the question comprehensively with only minor details potentially missing.",5,"This is an excellent and highly useful question that directly addresses a critical aspect of federal employment. Competitive status is a fundamental concept in federal hiring that impacts job opportunities, transfer rights, and career progression. The question is relevant to multiple stakeholders:

1. Job Seekers: Understanding how to acquire competitive status is crucial for those seeking federal employment, as it provides significant advantages in the hiring process.

2. HR Specialists: This question speaks directly to recruitment, hiring procedures, and personnel management within the federal competitive service.

3. Current Federal Employees: Knowing about competitive status can help employees understand their career mobility and potential job transfer opportunities.

4. Managers: Understanding competitive status is important for recruitment and staffing strategies.

The question demonstrates a genuine need for substantive information about a specific and important federal employment policy. It seeks to clarify both the definition of competitive status and the practical means of obtaining it, which has direct, actionable value for multiple stakeholders in the federal employment ecosystem.

The topic is deeply rooted in Title 5 regulations, which govern federal employment practices, making it highly relevant to the specific regulatory framework being examined. The question is clear, concise, and addresses a fundamental aspect of federal employment that is not immediately obvious to those outside the system."
" What is the definition of performance management according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations?

(a) Statutory authority. Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, provides for the establishment of agency perform-ance appraisal systems and requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations gov-erning such systems. The regulations in this subpart in combination with statute set forth the requirements for agency performance appraisal sys-tem(s) and program(s) for employees covered by subchapter I of chapter 43. (b) Savings provision. The perform- ance appraisal system portion of an agency’s Performance Management Plan approved by OPM as of September 22, 1995 shall constitute an approved performance appraisal system under the regulations in this subpart until such time changes to the system are approved. No provision of the regula-tions in this subpart shall be applied in such a way as to affect any administra-tive proceeding related to any action taken under regulations in this chapter pending on September 22, 1995. (c) Equivalent ratings of record. (1) If an agency has administratively adopt-ed and applied the procedures of this subpart to evaluate the performance of its employees, the ratings of record re-sulting from that evaluation are con-sidered ratings of record for reduction in force purposes. (2) Other performance evaluations given while an employee is not covered by the provisions of this subpart are considered ratings of record for reduc-tion in force purposes when the per-formance evaluation— (i) Was issued as an officially des- ignated evaluation under the employ-ing agency’s performance evaluation system, (ii) Was derived from the appraisal of performance against expectations that are established and communicated in advance and are work related, and (iii) Identified whether the employee performed acceptably. (3) When the performance evaluation does not include a summary level des-ignator and pattern comparable to those established at §430.208(d), the agency may identify a level and pat-tern based on information related to the appraisal process. [60 FR 43943, Aug. 23, 1995; 60 FR 47646, Sept. 13, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 62502, Nov. 24, 1997] § 430.202 Coverage. (a) Employees and agencies covered by statute. (1) Section 4301(1) of title 5, United States Code, defines agencies covered by this subpart. (2) Section 4301(2) of title 5, United States Code, defines employees covered by statute by this subpart. Besides General Schedule (GS/GM) and pre-vailing rate employees, coverage in-cludes, but is not limited to, senior- level and scientific and professional employees paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. (b) Statutory exclusions. This subpart does not apply to agencies or employ-ees excluded by 5 U.S.C. 4301(1) and (2), the United States Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission. (c) Administrative exclusions. OPM may exclude any position or group of positions in the excepted service under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4301(2)(G). The regulations in this subpart exclude ex-cepted service positions for which em-ployment is not reasonably expected to exceed the minimum period established under §430.207(a) in a consecutive 12- month period. (d) Agency requests for exclusions. Heads of agencies or their designees may request the Director of OPM to ex-clude positions in the excepted service. The request must be in writing, ex-plaining why the exclusion would be in the interest of good administration. § 430.203 Definitions. In this subpart, terms are defined as follows: Additional performance element means a dimension or aspect of individual, team, or organizational performance that is not a critical or non-critical element.

Critical element means a work assign- ment or responsibility of such impor-tance that unacceptable performance on the element would result in a deter-mination that an employee’s overall performance is unacceptable. Such ele-ments shall be used to measure per-formance only at the individual level. Non-critical element means a dimen- sion or aspect of individual, team, or organizational performance, exclusive of a critical element, that is used in as-signing a summary level.

The question seeks a precise definition from OPM regulations, which demonstrates a genuine need for authoritative information about performance evaluation standards and processes.

The usefulness of this question is strong for several stakeholders:
- HR Specialists: Would benefit from a clear, official definition to ensure consistent performance management practices
- Managers: Need to understand the official framework for evaluating employee performance
- Federal Employees: Can gain insights into how their performance will be assessed and measured
- New supervisors: Would find this definition crucial for understanding their performance management responsibilities

The question is technically phrased and seeks substantive knowledge directly from regulatory sources. It addresses a fundamental aspect of workplace governance in federal employment, helping stakeholders understand the structured approach to performance evaluation mandated by Title 5 regulations.

While not receiving a perfect 5 rating, it loses a point only because it requests a basic definitional understanding rather than a more complex policy interpretation or application. Nonetheless, it represents a solid, foundational inquiry into an important aspect of federal employment regulations."

(2) Each of these NPS jurisdictions is located in ( i.e., overlaps) more than one FWS wage area. (b) The special overlap wage sched- ules in each of the NPS jurisdictions shall be based on a determination con-cerning which regular nonsupervisory wage schedule in the overlapped FWS wage areas provides the most favorable payline for the employees. (c) The most favorable payline shall be determined by computing a simple average of the 15 nonsupervisory sec-ond step rates on each one of the reg-ular schedules authorized for each wage area overlapped. The highest av-erage obtained by this method will identify the regular schedule that pro-duces the most favorable payline.

(a) Tipped employees shall be paid from the regular nonappropriated fund (NAF) schedule applicable to the em-ployee’s duty station. (b) A tip offset may be authorized for employees classified as Waiter/Wait-ress. For purposes of this section, a tipped employee is one who is engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips, and a tip offset is the amount of money by which an employer, in meeting legal minimum wage standards, may reduce a tipped employee’s cash wage in con-sideration of the receipt of tips. (c) A tip offset may be established, abolished, or adjusted by NAF instru-mentalities on an annual basis and at such additional times as new or revised minimum wage statutes require. The amount of any tip offset may vary within a single instrumentality based on location, type of service, or time of service.

(a)(1) An employee may appeal the occupation series, grade or title of the job to the appropriate office of the Of-fice of Personnel Management only (i) after the agency has issued a decision under the system established under §532.703; and (ii) if the employee files the appeal with the Office of Personnel Management within 15 calendar days after receipt of the decision of the agency. (2) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may extend this time limit if it is shown that the employee was not noti-fied of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise aware of the limit, or that circumstances beyond the em-ployee’s control prevented filing an ap-peal within the prescribed time limit. (b) An employee shall make the ap- peal in writing and shall identify spe-cifically the portions of the decision or job analysis of the agency with which the employee disagrees. (c) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall base its decision on the record established in the agency, ex-cept that when the Office of Personnel Management investigates or audits the job it may take the results of the in-vestigation or audit into consideration. In the event the Office of Personnel Management audits the job, the em-ployee’s representative may not be present. (d) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment shall notify the employee and the agency in writing of its decision. The effective date of a change in the series, title and grade of a job directed by the Office of Personnel Management shall be specified in the decision of the Of-fice of Personnel Management, com-puted from the date the employee filed the application with the agency, and determined under §532.703(b)(10). How-ever, when the decision will result in a downgrading or other job-grading ac-tion that will reduce the pay of the in-cumbent of the job, the effective date may not be set earlier than the date on which the decision can be effected in accordance with procedures required by applicable law and regulation. (e) The appeal of an employee shall be canceled and the employee so noti-fied in the following circumstances: (1) On receipt of the employee’s writ- ten request; (2) On failure to prosecute, when the employee does not furnish requested information and duly proceed with the advancement of the appeal; however, instead of cancellation for failure to prosecute, an appeal may be adju-dicated if the information is sufficient for that purpose. The Office of Per-sonnel Management may reopen a can-celed appeal on a showing that cir-cumstances beyond the control of the employee prevented the employee from prosecuting the appeal; or (3) On notice that the employee has left the job, except when entitled to retroactive benefits, including benefits allowable after the death of an appel-lant. (f) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may, at its discretion, reopen and reconsider any job-grading decision made by the Office when requested by an employee or an agency.

(g) The Director of the Office of Per- sonnel Management may, at his or her discretion, reopen and reconsider any previous decision when the party re-questing reopening submits written ar-gument or evidence which tends to es-tablish that: (1) New and material evidence is available that was not readily avail-able when the previous decision was issued; (2) The previous decision involves an erroneous interpretation of law or reg-ulation or a misapplication of estab-lished policy; or (3) The previous decision is of a prec- edential nature involving a new or unreviewed policy consideration that may have effects beyond the actual case at hand, or is otherwise of such an exceptional nature as to merit the per-sonal attention of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.

It addresses a specific scenario involving advance payments and potential repayment waivers, which has practical implications for both employees and agency administrators. The question is particularly useful for:

1. HR specialists who need to understand the legal and procedural guidelines for handling advance payment situations
2. Managers responsible for approving or processing employee financial transactions
3. Federal employees who might find themselves in a situation requiring an advance payment waiver

The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the complexities of federal employment financial regulations. It seeks to clarify the specific circumstances under which an agency head can exercise discretion in waiving repayment, which suggests a need for precise policy interpretation. This type of question is valuable because it goes beyond surface-level understanding and delves into the specific conditions and potential exceptions in federal employment financial policies.

The practical applicability is high, as advance payments and their potential repayment can arise in various contexts such as relocation expenses, training costs, or emergency financial assistance. Understanding the waiver conditions helps ensure fair and consistent treatment of employees while providing agencies with flexibility in managing financial transactions."

(a) For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), 2672, and 2675, a claim is deemed to have been presented when OPM receives from a claimant, his or her authorized agent or legal rep-resentative, an executed Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury or Death), or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages stating a sum cer-tain (a specific dollar amount) for in-jury to or loss of property, personal in-jury, or death alleged to have occurred as a result of the incident. (b) All claims filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act as a result of the al-leged negligence or wrongdoing of OPM or its employees will be mailed or de-livered to the Office of the General Counsel, United States Office of Per-sonnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415–1300. (c) A claim must be presented to the Federal agency whose activities gave rise to the claim. A claim that should have been presented to OPM, but was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is presented to OPM, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), as of the date the claim is received by OPM. When a claim is mistakenly pre-sented to OPM, OPM will transfer the claim to the appropriate Federal agen-cy, if ascertainable, and advise the claimant of the transfer, or return the claim to the claimant. (d) A claimant whose claim arises from an incident involving OPM and one or more other Federal agencies, will identify each agency to which the claim has been submitted at the time the claim is presented to OPM. OPM will contact all other affected Federal agencies in order to designate the sin-gle agency that will investigate and de-cide the merits of the claim. In the event a designation cannot be agreed upon by the affected agencies, the De-partment of Justice will be consulted and will designate an agency to inves-tigate and determine the merits of the claim. The designated agency will no-tify the claimant that all future cor-respondence concerning the claim must be directed to that Federal agency.

Creditable overseas service is com-puted in accordance with the proce-dures in the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions. Creditable service may have been under more than one appointment and need not', 'at his or her discretion, delegate to an execu-tive agency the authority to make ini-tial determinations. However, OPM may review any initial determination and make a final adjudication in any case. If a delegation is made under this paragraph, the notice in §300.705(d)(1) will state that the individual may sub-mit a written request that OPM review the agency’s initial determination. The agency will forward to OPM copies of all documents relating to the individ-ual’s failure to register, including the individual’s request for review and his explanation of his failure to register. § 300.707 Termination of employment. A covered individual who is serving under an appointment made on or after November 8, 1985, and is not exempt from registration, will be terminated by his agency under the authority of the statute and these regulations if he has not registered as required, unless he registers or unless, if no longer eli-gible to register, OPM determines in response to his explanation that his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.

How-ever, the agency shall determine whether the employee’s performance is at an acceptable level of competence after no more than 52 calendar weeks following the original eligibility date for the within-grade increase and, for as long as the within-grade increase continues to be denied, determinations will be made']",4,"The context provides detailed information about the procedures for negative within-grade increase determinations, including the employee's right to request reconsideration within 15 days, the agency's requirement to establish a reconsideration file, grant official time to review materials, provide a written final decision, and inform the employee of their right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.",5,"This is an excellent, highly practical question that directly addresses a critical aspect of federal employee compensation and performance management under Title 5. The question touches on multiple important areas:

1. Procedural Requirements: It seeks to understand the specific steps an agency must follow when denying a within-grade increase, which is crucial for ensuring fair and transparent personnel actions.

2. Employee Rights: By inquiring about the employee's rights in this process, the question addresses due process and potential appeal mechanisms, which are fundamental to federal employment regulations.

3. Broad Stakeholder Relevance:
- HR Specialists: Need to know exact procedural requirements
- Managers: Must understand how to properly document and communicate performance-related compensation decisions
- Employees: Want to understand their rights and potential recourse if denied a step increase

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the nuanced interactions between agency actions and employee protections in the federal workplace. It goes beyond a simple procedural inquiry and explores the legal and administrative safeguards built into the federal employment system.

This type of question is precisely the kind of substantive, policy-oriented inquiry that helps stakeholders navigate the complexities of federal employment regulations with clarity and confidence."
" How does the performance appraisal process work for senior executives, and what factors are considered in their evaluation?"," Per §430.308, the performance appraisal process involves:
- Annual written performance appraisals
- Ratings based on both individual and organizational performance
- Consideration of multiple factors, including:
1. Results achieved related to agency mission
2. Overall quality of performance
3. Customer and employee perspectives
4. Effectiveness of employees under their supervision
5. Leadership effectiveness in promoting diversity and inclusion
6. Compliance with merit system principles

The process includes an initial rating by the supervisor, potential higher-level review, and final review by a Performance Review Board.","['its own performance management system for senior executives in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(a) Each senior executive must have a performance plan that describes the individual and organizational expecta-tions for the appraisal period that clearly fall within the senior execu-tive’s area of responsibility and con-trol. (b) Supervisors must develop per- formance plans in consultation with senior executives and communicate the plans to them in writing, including through the use of automated systems, on or before the beginning of the ap-praisal period. (c) A senior executive performance plan must include— (1) Critical elements. Critical elements must reflect individual performance re-sults or competencies as well as organi-zational performance priorities within each executive’s respective area of re-sponsibility and control, and be based on OPM-validated executive com-petencies. (2) Performance standards. Perform- ance plans must include the perform-ance standards describing each level of performance at which a senior execu-tive’s performance can be appraised. Performance standards describe the general expectations that must be met to be rated at each level of perform-ance and provide the benchmarks for developing performance requirements. (3) Performance requirements. At a minimum, performance requirements must describe expected accomplish-ments or demonstrated competencies for fully successful performance by the executive. An agency may establish performance requirements associated with other levels of performance as well. These performance requirements must align with agency mission and strategic planning initiatives. Per-formance requirements must contain measures of the quality, quantity, timeliness, cost savings, or manner of performance, as appropriate, expected for the applicable level of performance. (d) Agencies may require a review of senior executive performance plans at the beginning of the appraisal period to ensure consistency of agency-specific performance requirements. Such re- views may be performed by the Per-formance Review Board (PRB) or an-other body of the agency’s choosing. § 430.307 Monitoring performance. Supervisors must monitor each sen- ior executive’s performance throughout the appraisal period and hold at least one progress review. At a minimum, supervisors must inform senior execu-tives during the progress review about how well they are performing with re-gard to their performance plan. Super-visors must provide advice and assist-ance to senior executives on how to im-prove their performance. Supervisors and senior executives may also discuss available development opportunities for the senior executive. § 430.308 Appraising performance. (a) Agencies must establish appro- priate timelines for communicating performance plans, conducting apprais-als, and assigning and communicating annual summary ratings. (b) At least annually, agencies must appraise each senior executive’s per-formance in writing, including through the use of automated systems, and as-sign an annual summary rating at the end of the appraisal period. (c) Agencies must appraise a senior executive’s performance on the critical elements and performance require-ments in the senior executive’s per-formance plan. (d) Agencies must base appraisals of senior executive performance on both individual and organizational perform-ance as it applies to the senior execu-tive’s area of responsibility and con-trol, taking into account factors such as— (1) Results achieved in accordance with agency mission and strategic planning initiatives; (2) Overall quality of performance rendered by the executive, (3) Performance appraisal guidelines that must be based upon assessments of the agency’s performance and are provided by the oversight official to senior executives, rating and reviewing officials, PRB members, and appoint-ing authorities at the conclusion of the appraisal period and before completion of the initial summary ratings; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00375 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR366 5 CFR Ch.

(a) When rating senior executive per- formance, each agency must— (1) Comply with the requirements of this section, and (2) Establish a PRB as described at §430.311. (b) Each performance management system must provide that an appraisal and rating for a career appointee’s per-formance may not be made within 120 days after the beginning of a new President’s term. (c) When an agency cannot prepare an annual summary rating at the end of the appraisal period because the sen-ior executive has not completed the minimum appraisal period or for other reasons, the agency must extend the executive’s appraisal period. Once the appropriate conditions are met, the agency will then prepare the annual summary rating. (d) Senior executive performance ap- praisals and ratings are not appealable. (e) Procedures for rating senior ex- ecutives must provide for the fol-lowing: (1) Initial summary rating. The super- visor must develop an initial summary rating of the senior executive’s per-formance, in writing, including through the use of automated systems, and share that rating with the senior executive. The senior executive may respond in writing. (2) Higher-level review (HLR). A senior executive may ask for a higher-level official to review the initial summary rating before the rating is given to the PRB. The agency must provide each senior executive an opportunity for re-view of the initial summary rating by an employee, or (with the consent of the senior executive) a commissioned officer in the uniformed services on ac-tive duty in the agency, in a higher level in the agency. (i) A single review by an official at a higher level who did not participate in determining the executive’s initial summary rating will satisfy this re-quirement. An official providing HLR may not change the initial summary rating but may recommend a different rating to the PRB. HLR may be pro-vided by an official who is at a higher level in the agency than the appointing authority who will approve the final rating under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (ii) When an agency cannot provide review by a higher-level official for an executive who receives an initial sum-mary rating from the agency head be-cause no such official exists in the agency, the agency must offer an alter-native review as it determines appro-priate, except that the review may not be provided by', 'will be assessed (except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section). (2) If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more than $25, OPM will not release the records unless the requester agrees in advance to pay the anticipated charges. (3) OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when there is a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests to evade the assessment of fees. (i) If multiple requests of this type occur within a 30-day period, OPM may provide notice that it is aggregating the requests and that it will apply the fee provisions of this section, including any required agreement to pay fees and any advance payment. (ii) Before aggregating requests of this type made over a period longer than 30 days, OPM will assure that it has a solid basis on which to conclude that the requesters are acting in con-cert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees. (iii) OPM will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one person. (e) Payment of fees in advance. If OPM estimates or determines that fees are likely to exceed $250, OPM may require the payment of applicable fees in ad-vance. (1) If an OPM official, who is author- ized to make a decision on a particular request, determines that the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, OPM will provide notice of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment. (2) When a person, or an organization that a person represents, has pre-viously failed to pay assessed fees in a timely manner ( i.e., payment was not made within 30 days of the billing date), OPM will require full payment of all fees in advance. (3) If a person, or an organization that a person represents, has not paid fees previously assessed, OPM will not begin to process any new request for records until the requester has paid the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and made a full advance pay-ment for the new request. (f) Waiver or reduction of fees. OPM will furnish documents without any charge, or at a reduced charge, if dis-closure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public un-derstanding of the operations or activi-ties of the Government, and release of the material is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. (1) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, OPM shall consider the following factors: (i) The subject of the request: Wheth- er the subject of the requested records concerns ‘‘the operations or activities of the Government’’; (ii) The information value of the in- formation to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is ‘‘likely to contribute’’ to an understanding of Government oper-ations or activities; (iii) The contribution to an under- standing of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested in-formation will contribute to ‘‘public understanding’’; and (iv) The significance of the contribu- tion to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ‘‘significantly’’ to public under-standing of Government operations or activities. (2) In determining whether disclosure of the information is or is not pri-marily in the commercial interest of the requester, OPM shall consider the following factors: (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether the re- quester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so— (ii) The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of the identi-fied commercial interest of the re-quester is sufficiently large, in com-parison with the public interest in dis-closure, that disclosure is ‘‘primarily in the commercial interest of the re-quester.’’ VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR111 Office of Personnel Management § 294.111 (3) In all cases the burden of proof shall be on the requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. (g) Denial of waiver request. (1) An OPM official may deny a request for a full or partial waiver of fees without further consideration if the request does not include: (i) A clear statement of the request- er’s interest in the requested informa-tion; (ii) A clear statement of the use pro- posed for the information and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use; (iii) A clear statement of how the public will benefit from OPM’s release of the requested information; and (iv) If specialized use of the docu- ments is contemplated, a clear state-ment of the requester’s qualifications that are relevant to the specialized use. (2) A requester may appeal the denial of a waiver request as provided by §294.110 of this part. (h) Fees not paid; penalties; debt collec- tion. (1) If a request, which requires the advance payment of fees under the cri-teria specified in this section, is not ac-companied by the required payment, OPM will promptly notify the re-quester that the required fee must be paid within 30 days, and that OPM will not further process the request until it receives payment. (2) OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date on which the bill was sent. Interest will be charged at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, and will accrue from the date of the billing. (3) To encourage the repayment of debts incurred under this subpart, OPM may use the procedures authorized by Public Law 97–365, the Debt Collection Act of 1982. This may include disclo-sure to consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies. [58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993] § 294.110 Appeals.

(g) When availability pay is suspended. The employing agency is not subject to the requirement of paragraph (d) of this section in the case of a criminal investigator for whom availability pay is suspended in accordance with §550.184(d) due to denial or cancellation of the required certification based on— (1) Failure to perform unscheduled duty as assigned or reported; or (2) Inability to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period because of a physical or health condition. [59 FR 66151, Dec. 23, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 4520, Jan. 29, 1999] § 550.183 Substantial hours require- ment. (a) A criminal investigator shall be eligible for availability pay only if the annual average number of hours of un-scheduled duty per regular workday is 2 hours or more, as certified in accord-ance with §550.184. This average is com-puted by dividing the total unsched-uled duty hours for the annual period (numerator) by the number of regular workdays (denominator). (b) For the purpose of this section, regular workday means each day in the criminal investigator’s basic workweek during which the investigator works at least 4 hours, excluding— (1) Overtime hours compensated under 5 U.S.C. 5542 and §550.111; (2) Unscheduled duty hours com- pensated by availability pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545a and this subpart; and (3) Hours during which an investi- gator is engaged in agency-approved training, is traveling under official travel orders, is on approved leave, or is on excused absence with pay (includ-ing paid holidays). (c) In computing average hours under paragraph (a) of this section, the total unscheduled duty hours in the numer-ator shall include— (1) Any unscheduled duty hours on a regular workday; and (2) Any unscheduled duty hours actu- ally worked by an investigator on days that are not regular workdays.

A similar certification shall be made for a criminal investigator who will begin receiving availability pay after a period of nonreceipt (e.g., a des-ignated voluntary opt-out period under §550.182(e)). (b) Each criminal investigator who is receiving availability pay and the ap-propriate supervisory officer (as des-ignated by the head of the agency or authorized designee) shall make an an-nual certification to the head of the agency attesting that the investigator currently meets, and is expected to continue to meet during the upcoming 1-year period, the substantial hours re-quirement in §550.183. (c) A certification shall no longer apply when the employee separates from Federal service, is employed by another agency, moves to a position that does not qualify as a criminal in-vestigator position, or begins a vol-untary opt-out period under §550.182(e). (d) The employing agency shall en- sure that criminal investigators receiv-ing availability pay comply with the substantial hours requirement in §550.183, as certified in accordance with this section. The employing agency may deny or cancel a certification based on a finding that an investigator has failed to perform unscheduled duty (availability or work) as assigned or re-ported, or is unable to perform un-scheduled duty for an extended period due to physical or health reasons. If a certification is denied or canceled, the investigator’s entitlement to avail-ability pay shall be suspended for an appropriate period, consistent with agency policies. If the investigator’s certification was valid when made, the suspension of availability pay shall be effected prospectively. (e) An involuntary suspension of availability pay resulting from a denial or cancellation of certification under paragraph (d) of this section is a reduc-tion in pay for the purpose of applying the adverse action procedures of 5 U.S.C. 7512 and part 752 of this chapter, except for special agents in the Foreign Service. For special agents in the For-eign Service, an involuntary suspen- sion of availability pay resulting from a denial or cancellation of certification under paragraph (d) of this section will be administered under procedures es-tablished by regulations of the Depart-ment of State. (f) The head of an agency (or author- ized designee) may prescribe any addi-tional regulations necessary to admin-ister the certification requirement, in-cluding procedures for retroactive cor-rection in cases in which a certifi-cation is issued belatedly or lapses due to administrative error.

(a) Availability pay is paid only for periods of time during which a crimi-nal investigator receives basic pay. Availability pay is an amount equal to the lesser of—(1) 25 percent of a crimi-nal investigator’s rate of basic pay, as defined in §550.103, including amounts designated as ‘‘salary’’ for special agents in the Diplomatic Security Service; or (2) The maximum amount that may be paid to avoid exceeding the max-imum earnings limitation on premium pay for law enforcement officers in 5 U.S.C. 5547(c). (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a criminal investi-gator who is eligible for availability pay shall continue to receive such pay during any period such investigator is attending agency-sanctioned training, on agency-ordered travel status, on agency-approved leave with pay, or on excused absence with pay for reloca-tion purposes. (c) Agencies may, at their discretion, provide availability pay to criminal in-vestigators during training that is con-sidered initial, basic training usually provided in the first year of service.

As provided in section 1313(a)(3) of Public Law 107–296, any agency exer-cising Voluntary Separation Incentive authority in effect on January 24, 2003, may continue to offer Voluntary Sepa-ration Incentives consistent with that authority until that authority expires. An agency that is eligible to offer Vol-untary Separation Incentive Payments under this authority and under any other statutory authority may choose which authority it wishes to use, or offer incentives under both.

An executive branch employee who received a Voluntary Separation Incen-tive Payment as described in subpart A of this part and accepts any employ-ment for compensation with the Gov-ernment of the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based must repay the entire amount of the Vol-untary Separation Incentive Payment to the agency that paid it before the individual’s first day of reemployment. § 576.203 Waivers of the Voluntary Separation Incentive Repayment requirement. (a)(1) If the proposed reemployment is with an agency other than the Gov-ernment Accountability Office, the United States Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the repayment if— (i) The individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only quali-fied applicant available for the posi-tion; or (ii) In case of an emergency involving a direct threat to life or property, the individual— (A) Has skills directly related to re- solving the emergency; and (B) Will serve on a temporary basis only so long as that individual’s serv-ices are made necessary by the emer-gency. (2) If the proposed reemployment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may waive the re-payment if the individual involved pos-sesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the po- sition. (3) If the proposed reemployment is with the judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive the re-payment if the individual involved pos-sesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the po-sition. (4) The repayment waiver provisions under this section do not extend to a repayment obligation resulting from employment under a personal services contract or other direct contract. (b) For a Voluntary Separation In- centive Payment made under statutory authority other than subpart A of this part, the agency should review the au-thorizing statute and, if a waiver is permitted, submit a request as speci-fied by that statute.

For senior executives, it provides critical insight into their performance evaluation framework. For HR specialists and managers, it offers guidance on the specific criteria and processes used to assess senior leadership performance. The question addresses a key aspect of performance management under Title 5, which governs federal employment practices.

The query is particularly relevant because senior executive performance evaluations differ significantly from standard federal employee assessments. It touches on important elements such as:
1. Performance standards for high-level federal leadership
2. Potential links between performance ratings and career progression
3. Accountability mechanisms for top-tier government managers
4. Potential implications for organizational effectiveness

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment regulations and seeks substantive information about a complex evaluation process. It would be useful for current senior executives, those aspiring to senior roles, HR professionals designing performance management systems, and researchers studying federal governance structures.

The practical implications are significant, as performance appraisals directly impact career trajectories, compensation, and organizational leadership quality in the federal government. By seeking detailed information about the evaluation process, the question shows a nuanced approach to understanding federal employment policies."

The head of the agency (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt such an employee or group of employees from the advanced sched-uling requirement in §630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sec-tion terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) de-termines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or designee) must no-tify any employee exempted from the scheduling requirement in writing.

An on-going exigency of the public business is an exigency that commences imme-diately after the termination of a na-tional emergency exigency and is di-rectly related to the matter that was previously determined to be a national emergency exigency. In order for an employee to be covered under an ongo-ing exigency, the employee must first be covered by a national emergency ex-igency and then be covered by the on-going exigency without a break in time. (2) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an on-going exigency, the employee will not be subject to time limits on usage of any restored leave to the employee’s credit under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), including a time limit established under para-graph (d) of this section that is deter-mined based on the termination of the national emergency exigency. When the ongoing exigency ends, all restored annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) to the employee’s credit must be consoli-dated at that time and made subject to a single time limit that is determined under the rules in paragraph (d) of this section, using the termination date of the ongoing exigency in place of the termination date of the national emer-gency exigency. (3) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an on-going exigency, the employee will not be subject to the advance scheduling requirements in §630.308(a). An agency head (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt an employee or group of employees from the advanced scheduling require-ment in §630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under the on-going exigency terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) determines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or des-ignee) must notify any employee ex-empted from the scheduling require-ment in writing. (4) Employee coverage under such an ongoing exigency may not be continued for more than 12 months unless the agency head (or designee) requests, and the Director of OPM approves, one or more time-limited waivers based on a critical agency need for the services of the employee or group of employees. (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if an ongoing exigency (which excludes time covered by the preceding national emergency exi-gency) also qualifies as an extended ex-igency under §630.309, the time limit for use of the restored leave under paragraph (a) of that section must be applied to the consolidated restored leave.

In some agencies, the performance ap-praisal system(s) covers employees in many organizations and/or compo-nents, and their ability to meet the certification criteria in §430.404 may vary significantly. In such cases, an agency may establish and/or submit separate performance appraisal sys-tems for each of these distinct organi-zations and/or components to ensure timely certification of those perform-ance appraisal system(s) that meet the criteria. New appraisal systems estab-lished under 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable based on the em-ployees covered, must be approved by OPM. (c) When an agency establishes a new appraisal system for the purpose of seeking certification under this sub-part, the agency may submit that sys-tem for certification even if it has not yet been approved by OPM under §430.312 or §430.210, as applicable. OPM will certify, with OMB concurrence, only those systems that OPM deter-mines meet the approval requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as ap-plicable. (d) An agency must establish an ap- praisal system(s), as defined in §430.402, for its senior professionals that meets the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, and is separate from the system(s) established to cover its SES members under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C. For the purpose of certification under this subpart, such senior profes-sional appraisal system(s) must meet the certification criteria set forth in §430.404. At its discretion, an agency may include system features in its sen-ior professional appraisal system(s) that are the same as, or similar to, the features of its SES appraisal system(s), as appropriate, including procedures that correspond to the higher level re-view procedures under §430.308(b) and PRB reviews of summary ratings under §430.308(c).

Such system(s) must pro-vide for the following: (1) Alignment, so that the perform- ance expectations for individual senior employees derive from, and clearly link to, the agency’s mission, GPRA strategic goals, program and policy ob-jectives, and/or annual performance plans and budget priorities; (2) Consultation, so that the perform- ance expectations for senior employees meet the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, as applicable, and/or other applicable legal authority; are developed with the input and in-volvement of the individual senior em-ployees who are covered thereby; and are communicated to them at the be-ginning of the applicable appraisal pe- riod, and/or at appropriate times there-after; (3) Results, so that the performance expectations for individual senior em-ployees apply to their respective areas of responsibility; reflect expected agen-cy and/or organizational outcomes and outputs, performance targets or metrics, policy/program objectives, and/or milestones; identify specific pro-grammatic crosscutting, external, and partnership-oriented goals or objec-tives, as applicable; and are stated in terms of observable, measurable, and/or demonstrable performance; (4) Balance, so that in addition to ex- pected results, the performance expec-tations for individual senior employees include appropriate measures or indi-cators of employee and/or customer/ VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00380 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR371 Office of Personnel Management § 430.404 stakeholder feedback; quality, quan- tity, timeliness, and cost effectiveness, as applicable; and those technical, leadership and/or managerial com-petencies or behaviors that contribute to and are necessary to distinguish outstanding performance; (5) Appropriate assessments of the agency’s performance—overall and with respect to each of its particular missions, components, programs, pol-icy areas, and support functions—such as reports of the agency’s GPRA goals, annual performance plans and targets, program performance measures, and other appropriate indicators, as well as evaluation guidelines based, in part, upon those assessments, that are com-municated by the agency head, or an individual specifically designated by the agency head for such purpose, to senior employees, appropriate senior employee rating and reviewing offi-cials, and PRB members. These assess-ments and guidelines are to be provided at the conclusion of the appraisal pe-riod but before individual senior em-ployee performance ratings are rec-ommended, so that they may serve as a basis for individual performance eval-uations, as appropriate. The guidance provided may not take the form of quantitative limitations on the number of ratings at any given rating level, and must conform to 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable; (6) Oversight by the agency head or the individual specifically designated under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, who certifies, for a particular senior employee appraisal system, that— (i) The senior employee appraisal process makes meaningful distinctions based on relative performance; (ii) The results of the senior em- ployee appraisal process take into ac-count, as appropriate, the agency’s as-sessment of its performance against program performance measures, as well as other relevant considerations; and', 'the SES.

An appointing officer who intends to employ with reemployment rights an employee of another executive agency shall give the losing agency written no-tice at least 15 calendar days before the effective date of the proposed action. If the losing agency believes the grant of reemployment rights would be detri-mental to the public interest, it may appeal the proposed grant to OPM within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice. The losing agency, at the same time, shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the prospective appointing officer, who shall withhold the pro-posed grant pending decision on the ap-peal. OPM shall determine whether the employee will be given reemployment rights and notify both agencies accord-ingly. If the losing agency does not ap-peal within 15 calendar days, the em-ployee shall be granted reemployment rights. § 352.205a Authority to return em- ployee to his or her former or suc-cessor agency. The transfer of an employee with a grant of reemployment rights under this subpart authorizes the return of the employee to his or her former or successor agency without regard to part 351, 752, or 771 of this chapter when the employee is reemployed in his or her former or successor agency— (a) Without a break in service of 1 workday or more in a position at the same or higher grade in the same occu-pational field and geographical area as the position he or she last held in the former or successor agency; and (b) At not less than the rate of pay he or she would have been receiving in the position last held in the former or suc-cessor agency if he or she had not been transferred.

(b) Termination. An employee’s reem- ployment rights terminate if: (1) He fails to apply within the time limits stated in paragraph (a) of this section; (2) He resigns without the written consent of the current employing agen-cy; or (3) Within 10 calendar days, he fails to accept an offer of reemployment made under §352.208 which is deter-mined to be a proper offer of reemploy-ment by the reemploying agency or by the Merit Systems Protection Board on appeal. § 352.208 Agency’s obligation to reem- ploy. (a) Employee’s right to reemployment. An employee is entitled to be reem-ployed by the reemploying agency as promptly as possible but not more than 30 calendar days after receipt of his ap-plication. Except as provided in para-graph (c) of this section, the employee is entitled to reemployment in the oc-cupational field and at the same grade or level and in the same geographical area as the position which the em-ployee last held in that agency. If the reemployment would cause the separa-tion or demotion of another employee, the applicant shall then be considered an employee for the purpose of apply-ing the reduction-in-force regulations (5 CFR part 351) to determine to what, if any, position, he or she is entitled. (b) Reemployment in a higher grade. The reemploying agency may reemploy the employee in a position of higher grade than that to which he is entitled, but not if this reemployment would cause the displacement of another em-ployee. (c) Reemployment in SES. When the employee’s right is to a position in the SES, reemployment or return may be to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified. (d) Seniority in postal service. On reem- ployment in the postal service, the em-ployee is entitled to the seniority he would have attained had he remained in the postal service. (e) Basis for agency refusal to reemploy. An agency may refuse to reemploy under this section only when the em-ployee was last separated for serious cause evidencing his unsuitability for reemployment.

A claim accrues when loss or damage is or should have been discovered by claimant even though such loss or damage occurred at a prior time. § 180.104 Allowable claims. (a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the neg-ligent or wrongful act of the claimant, claimant’s agent, a member of claim-ant’s family, or claimant’s private em-ployee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the cir-cumstances); (2) The possession of the property damaged or lost and the quantity pos-sessed is determined to have been rea-sonable, useful, or proper under the cir-cumstances; and (3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence. (b) Claims which are otherwise allow- able under this part shall not be dis-allowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claim-ant at the time of the damage or loss or solely because the claimant was not legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, bor-rowed property may be the subject of a claim. (c) Subject to the conditions in §180.104(a) and the other provisions of this part, any claim for damage to or loss of personal property incident to service with OPM may be considered and allowed. The following are exam-ples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed.

(3) Motor vehicles. Claims may be al- lowed for automobiles and other motor vehicles damaged or lost in oversea shipments provided by the Govern-ment. ‘‘Shipments provided by the Government’’ means via Government vessels, charter of commercial vessels, or by Government bills of lading on commercial vessels, and includes stor-age, unloading, and off-loading inci-dent thereto. Other claims for damage to or loss of automobiles and other motor vehicles may be allowed only when use of the vehicle on a non-reim-bursable basis was required by the claimant’s supervisor. (4) Mobile homes. Claims may be al- lowed for damage to or loss of mobile homes and their contents under the provisions of §180.104(c)(2). Claims for structural damage to mobile homes, other than that caused by collision, and damage to contents of mobile homes resulting from such structural damage must contain conclusive evi-dence that the damage was not caused by structural deficiency of the mobile home and that it was not overloaded. Claims for damage to or loss of tires mounted on mobile homes may be al-lowed only in cases of collision, theft, or vandalism. (5) Money. Claims for money in an amount that is determined to be rea-sonable for the claimant to possess at the time of the loss are payable: (i) Where personal funds were accept- ed by responsible Government per-sonnel with apparent authority to re-ceive them for safekeeping deposit, transmittal, or other authorized dis-position, but were neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned; (ii) When lost incident to a marine or aircraft disaster; (iii) When lost by fire, flood, hurri- cane, or other natural disaster; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR44 5 CFR Ch.

(6) Clothing. Claims may be allowed for clothing and accessories worn on the person which are damaged or lost: (i) During the performance of official duties in an unusual or extraordinary- risk situation; (ii) In cases involving emergency ac- tion required by natural disaster such as fire, flood, hurricane, or by enemy or other belligerent action; (iii) In cases involving faulty equip- ment or defective furniture maintained by the Government and used by the claimant as required by the job situa-tion; or (iv) When using a motor vehicle. (7) Property used for benefit of the Gov- ernment.

It directly addresses an important aspect of employee mobility and rights under Title 5, which is critical for:

1. Employees who may be transferred between agencies and need to understand their reemployment protections
2. HR specialists who must correctly implement and advise on transfer and reemployment procedures
3. Managers involved in inter-agency transfers and understanding employee rights
4. Legal and compliance professionals tracking federal employment regulations

The question touches on a practical and specific regulatory concern that has direct implications for federal workforce management. Understanding time limits for reemployment rights is crucial for both employees and agencies to ensure proper procedural compliance and protect employee career opportunities during agency transfers.

The query demonstrates a substantive information need about a nuanced aspect of federal employment regulations, making it extremely valuable for anyone seeking to comprehensively understand Title 5 employment protections and procedures. Its specificity and focus on a concrete procedural detail make it particularly useful for professionals navigating federal employment policies."

For purposes of this paragraph, a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated claim will be treated as a single claim. (b) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled under this part, only after con-sultation with the Department of Jus-tice when, in the opinion of the Gen-eral Counsel of OPM, or his or her des-ignee: (1) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved; or (2) A question of policy is or may be involved; or (3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and OPM is unable to adjust the third party claim; or (4) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, will or may control the disposition of a re-lated claim in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000. (c) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled under 28 U.S.C. 2672, and this part, only after consultation with the Department of Justice when, OPM is informed or is otherwise aware that the United States or an employee, agent, or cost-type contractor of the United States is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction. § 177.108 Referral to Department of Justice. When Department of Justice ap- proval or consultation is required, or the advice of the Department of Jus-tice is otherwise to be requested, under §177.107, the written referral or request will be transmitted to the Department of Justice by the General Counsel of OPM or his or her designee. § 177.109 Final denial of claim. Final denial of an administrative claim must be in writing and sent to the claimant, his or her attorney, or legal representative by certified or reg-istered mail. The notification of final denial may include a statement of the reasons for the denial. But, it must in-clude a statement that, if the claimant is dissatisfied with the OPM action, he or she may file suit in an appropriate United States district court not later than 6 months after the date of mailing of the notification. § 177.110 Action on approved claim. (a) Payment of a claim approved under this part is contingent on claim-ant’s execution of a Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury or Death); a claims settlement agreement; and a Standard Form 1145 (Voucher for Pay-ment), as appropriate.

An employee is entitled to a night pay differential for a period when he is excused from nightwork on a holiday or other nonworkday and for night hours of his tour of duty while he is in an official travel status, whether per-forming actual duty or not. (b) Absence on leave. An employee is entitled to a night pay differential for a period of paid leave only when the total amount of that leave in a pay pe-riod, including both night and day hours, is less than 8 hours. (c) Relation to overtime, Sunday, and holiday pay. Night pay differential is in addition to overtime, Sunday, or holi-day pay payable under this subpart and it is not included in the rate of basic pay used to compute the overtime, Sunday, or holiday pay. (d) Temporary assignment to a different daily tour of duty. An employee is enti- tled to a night pay differential when he or she is temporarily assigned during the administrative workweek to a daily tour of duty that includes night-work. This temporary change in a daily tour of duty within the employee’s reg-ularly scheduled administrative work-week is distinguished from a period of irregular or occasional overtime work in addition to the employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.

(a) Time limits. An employee is to be reemployed by the reemploying agency as promptly as possible, but not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the reemployment application or on termination of the term of employ-ment with the Commission, whichever is later. (b) Conditions. An employee will be reemployed or returned from detail without loss of pay, seniority, or other rights or benefits to which the em-ployee would have been entitled had he or she not been transferred or detailed. An employee in the Senior Executive Service will be reemployed or returned at not less than the rate at which paid immediately before the transfer or de-tail. An employee who is reemployed is not eligible for grade or pay retention under part 536 of this chapter based on a grade or rate of pay attained while employed by the Commission. (c) Position to which entitled. (1) If the function with which the employee’s former position was identified has been transferred, the employee’s right is to a position in the gaining agency or ac-tivity. (2) An employee whose right is to a position in the Senior Executive Serv-ice may be reemployed in or returned to any Senior Executive Service posi-tion in the former agency for which qualified. (3) All other employees are entitled to be reemployed in or returned to a position at the same grade or level and in the same competitive area as the po-sition last held in the former agency. If the reemployment would cause the sep-aration or demotion of another em-ployee, the applicant should be consid-ered an employee for the purpose of ap-plying the reduction-in-force regula-tions to determine to what, if any, po-sition the employee is entitled. If the employee is not placed at the former grade or level, the agency must extend consideration beyond the competitive area. Responsibility for reemployment is agencywide. (4) Reemployment may be at a higher grade than that to which the employee is entitled if all appropriate standards and requirements are satisfied and if this will not cause the displacement of another employee. (5) The reemployment obligation may be satisfied by placement in any position within the agency that is ac-ceptable to the employee. (d) Agency refusal to reemploy. An agency may refuse to reemploy under this section only when the employee was separated from the Commission for serious cause showing unsuitability for reemployment. § 352.909 Appeals. (a) If an agency denies reemployment to an applicant who claims reemploy-ment rights under this subpart, the agency must notify the applicant in writing of that denial and its reasons. In the same notice, the agency will in-form the applicant of the right to ap-peal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board’s regulations. The agency must comply with the provisions of §1201.21 of this title. (b)(1) When an agency has reem- ployed or returned an employee, it will advise the employee of the right of ap-peal if he or she considers the reem-ployment or return not to be in accord-ance with the Act and this subpart. (2) An employee in a bargaining unit covered by a negotiated grievance pro-cedure that does not exclude this mat-ter must use the negotiated grievance procedure. (3) An employee to whom paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board’s regulations.

[59 FR 35216, July 11, 1994] Subpart B—Salary Offset SOURCE : 59 FR 35216, July 11, 1994, unless otherwise noted. § 179.201 Purpose. The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97–365), is to pro-vide a comprehensive statutory ap-proach to the collection of debts due the Federal Government. These regula-tions implement section 5 of the Act which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset, except that no claim may be collected by such means if out-standing for more than 10 years after the agency’s right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government’s right to collect were not known, and could not reasonably have been known, by the official or of-ficials who were charged with the re-sponsibility for discovery and collec-tion of such debts. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. § 179.202 Scope. (a) These regulations provide proce- dures for the collection of monies from a Federal employee’s pay by salary off-set to satisfy certain debts owed the Government. (b) These regulations apply to all col- lections by the Director of OPM (ex-cept collections involving debts be-cause of payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, payments made under the Re-tired Federal Employees Health Bene-fits Act (74 Stat. 849),']",5,"The context provides extremely precise and detailed information about the specific circumstances requiring Department of Justice consultation before settling an administrative claim, including when a new precedent or point of law is involved, when a policy question is present, when third-party indemnity claims are unresolvable, or when the compromise might control the disposition of a related claim exceeding $25,000.",4,"This question is highly relevant to federal employment and administrative law procedures under Title 5. It addresses an important legal and procedural aspect of federal agency operations, specifically related to administrative claims and settlements. The question would be particularly useful for:

1. HR specialists and legal counsel in federal agencies who need to understand the precise conditions for consulting the Department of Justice before settling a claim
2. Managers involved in administrative dispute resolution
3. Federal employees and their representatives who want to understand the legal process of claim settlements
4. Legal researchers studying federal administrative procedures

The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between federal agencies and the Department of Justice in managing legal claims. While it may be somewhat technical, it represents a critical procedural knowledge that can have significant implications for how administrative disputes are handled, potentially affecting financial outcomes, legal risks, and procedural compliance.

The practicality is high because settlement procedures are a common concern in federal employment contexts, and knowing when DOJ consultation is required can prevent potential legal missteps. The question seeks substantive information about a specific regulatory requirement, which makes it valuable for professionals navigating federal administrative processes."
" What are the key requirements for an employee to propose a voluntary repayment agreement for a debt without salary offset?
"," According to §179.209, the employee must submit a written proposal that: (1) Admits the existence of the debt, (2) Is legally enforceable, (3) Is signed by both the employee and creditor agency, (4) Specifies all payment terms, and (5) Contains a provision accelerating the debt in case of default. The proposal must be received within 30 calendar days after receiving the notice of intent, and the creditor agency has discretion to accept or reject the repayment agreement.","['salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a pro-posed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must: (i) Be in writing; (ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency; (iii) Specify all the terms of the ar- rangement for payment; and (iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee’s disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to deduction of a greater amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)). (2) Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by the official designated in the notice of in-tent within 30 calendar days after re-ceipt of the notice. (b) The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted repay-ment proposal by the employee debtor and notify the employee whether the proposed written agreement for repay-ment is acceptable. It is within the creditor agency’s discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of pro-ceeding by offset. (c) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 days from the date he or she re-ceived notice of that decision to file a petition for a hearing or a special re-view as provided by §179.210. (d) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrange-ment must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency designee and meet the other re-quirements of this section for a vol-untary repayment agreement.

(a) An OPM employee subject to sal- ary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the Office of the amount of the salary offset or vol-untary payment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, di-vorce, death, or disability. (b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and sup-porting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indi-cating: (1) Income from all sources; (2) Assets; (3) Liabilities; (4) Number of dependents; (5) Expenses for food, housing, cloth- ing and transportation; (6) Medical expenses; and (7) Exceptional expenses, if any. If an OPM employee requests a special review under this section, the em-ployee shall file an alternative pro-posed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents (§179.210(b)), stating why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the em-ployee. (c) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original off-set or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the em-ployee. The Director shall notify the employee in writing of such determina-tion, including, if appropriate, a re-vised offset or repayment schedule. (d) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the OPM salary offset coordinator shall provide a new certification to the pay-roll office. § 179.211 Notice of salary offset. (a) Upon receipt of proper certifi- cation from a creditor agency, the OPM payroll office will send the OPM employee, identified in the certifi-cation as the debtor, a written notice of salary offset. Such notice shall, at a minimum: (1) State that OPM has received a properly certified debt claim from a creditor agency; (2) Contain a copy of the certification received from the creditor agency; (3) Advise the employee that salary offset will be initiated at the next offi-cially established pay interval; and (4) State the amount of the claim and amount of deductions. (b) The payroll office shall provide a copy of the notice to the creditor agen-cy and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be offset and the pay period when the offset will begin. § 179.212 Procedures for salary offset. (a) The Director or his or her des- ignee shall coordinate salary deduc-tions under this subpart. (b) OPM payroll office shall deter- mine the amount of an employee’s dis-posable pay and implement the salary offset. (c) Deductions shall begin effective the pay period following receipt by OPM’s payroll office of proper certifi-cation of the debt (§179.208). (d) Types of collection —(1) Lump-sum payment. A debt will be collected in a lump sum if possible. If an employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an offi-cially established pay interval, collec-tion must be made in installments. (2) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment and, except in rare cir-cumstances, not to exceed 3 years. The size and frequency of installment de-ductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employ-ee’s ability to pay. The amount de-ducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. (3) Lump-sum deductions from final check. A lump-sum deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limita-tion may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated volun-tarily or involuntarily.

When an employee subject to salary offset is separated from OPM and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Office, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCCS and OPM’s imple-menting regulations, may offset the balance of the debt against any finan-cial payment due the employee from the U.S. Government. (e) Multiple debts. In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seek-ing salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, OPM payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simulta-neously within the 15 percent limita-tion. (f) Precedence of debts', '(1), (2), or (3) of this section, the agency may separate the employee from the civil service. § 317.306 Conversion of employees under time limited appointments. (a) Coverage. This section covers em- ployees serving under: (1) A limited executive assignment under subpart E of part 305 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; or (2) A similar type of time limited ap- pointment in an excepted service posi-tion. (b) Senior Executive Service appoint- ment. An employee covered by this sec- tion shall be subject to one of the fol-lowing actions. (1) If the position in which the em- ployee is serving under a limited exec-utive assignment or similar type of time limited appointment will termi-nate within three years from the date of the proposed conversion action, the agency may convert the employee to a Senior Executive Service limited term appointment. (2) If the position in which the em- ployee is serving under a limited exec-utive assignment or similar type of time limited appointment will not ter-minate within three years from the date of the proposed conversion action, the agency may convert the employee to a Senior Executive Service non-career appointment and assign the em-ployee to a ‘‘general’’ position. (3) If the employee under a limited executive assignment has reinstate-ment eligibility to a position in the competitive service, or, as determined by the Office of Personnel Manage-ment, had substantial career-oriented service under a career-type appoint-ment as defined in §317.304(a)(2), and if immediately prior to the limited exec-utive assignment and without a break in service the employee served under a career appointment or career-type ap-pointment in a position now being des-ignated a Senior Executive Service po-sition then the employee may request conversion to a career appointment. Such request must be made on or be-fore the end of the notice period. (i) If the employee requests conver- sion to career, the agency will convert the employee to a Senior Executive Service career appointment. The em-ployee may be assigned to a ‘‘general’’ or a ‘‘career reserved’’ position. The name of the individual and basis for ap-proving the request must be published in the F EDERAL REGISTER . (ii) If the employee does not request conversion to career, the agency will convert the employee as provided for in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this sec-tion. (4) In lieu of action under paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, the agency may separate the employee from the civil service. Subpart D—Qualifications Standards SOURCE : 54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, unless oth- erwise noted. § 317.401 General. (a) The head of each agency is re- sponsible for establishing qualifica-tions standards for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions in accordance with the procedures described in this subpart. (b) A written qualification standard must be established for a position be-fore any appointment is made to the position. If a position is being filled competitively, the standard must be established before the position is an-nounced. [54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 6385, Feb. 2, 1995] § 317.402 Career reserved positions. (a) The qualifications standard must be in writing and identify the breadth and depth of the professional/technical and executive/managerial knowledges, skills, and abilities, or other qualifica-tions, required for successful perform-ance in the position. (b) The standard must be specific enough to enable applicants to be rated and ranked according to their degree of qualifications when the position is being filled on a competitive basis.

The standard may not emphasize agency-re-lated experience, however, to the ex-tent that it precludes otherwise well- qualified candidates from outside the agency from appointment consider-ation. (d) The standard may not include— (1) A minimum length of experience requirement beyond that authorized for similar positions in the General Schedule; (2) A minimum education require- ment beyond that authorized for simi-lar positions in the General Schedule; or (3) Any criterion prohibited by law or regulation. § 317.403 General positions. An agency may apply the criteria in §317.402 when developing qualifications standards for general positions. If it does not, OPM must be consulted be-fore the agency develops the standard. § 317.404 Retention of qualifications standards. If a qualifications standard is changed, or a position is cancelled, the former standard shall be retained for 2 years. Subpart E—Career Appointments SOURCE : 54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, unless oth- erwise noted. § 317.501 Recruitment and selection for initial SES career appointment be achieved from the brightest and most diverse pool possible. (a) Executive Resources Board (ERB). The head of each agency shall appoint one or more ERBs from among employ-ees of the agency or commissioned offi-cers of the uniformed services serving on active duty in the agency. The ERB shall, in accordance with the require-ments of this section, conduct the merit staffing process for initial SES career appointment. (b) Recruitment. (1) As a minimum, the source of recruitment to fill a SES position by career appointment must include all groups of qualified individ-uals within the civil service (as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2101). It may also include qualified individuals outside the civil service. (2) Before an agency can fill an SES vacancy by career appointment, it must post a vacancy announcement in USAJOBS for at least 14 calendar days, including the date of publication. Each agency’s SES vacancy announcement must comply with criteria in §330.707 of subpart G of this chapter. (c) Merit staffing requirements. As a minimum, agencies must— (1) Provide that competition be fair and open, that all candidates compete and be rated and ranked on the same basis, and that selection be based sole-ly on qualifications and not on polit-ical or other non-job-related factors. If a candidate is a current SES career ap-pointee or an SES reinstatement eligi-ble, an agency may consider the can-didate either competitively or non-competitively. (2) Provide that the ERB consider the executive and technical qualifications of each candidate, other than those found ineligible because they do not meet the requirements of the vacancy announcement. Preliminary qualifica-tions screening, rating, and ranking of candidates may be delegated by the ERB. (3) Provide that the rating proce- dures sufficiently differentiate among eligible candidates on the basis of the knowledges, skills, abilities, and other job-related factors in the qualifications standard for the position so as to en-able the relative ranking of the can-didates. For this purpose, eligible can- didates may be grouped into broad cat-egories, such as highly', 'permanent position of record; (2) Has no greater promotion poten- tial than the CTAP eligible’s perma-nent position of record; (3) Is in the same local commuting area as the CTAP eligible’s permanent position of record; (4) Is filled during the CTAP eligi- ble’s eligibility period; and, if applica-ble, (5) Is filled under the same excepted appointing authority as the CTAP eli-gible’s permanent position of record if the CTAP eligible is an excepted serv-ice employee and the agency CTAP provides selection priority in the ex-cepted service. (d) An agency may take actions under §335.102 of this chapter to place a permanent competitive service em-ployee into a vacancy if there are no CTAP eligible employees in the local commuting area or if no CTAP eligi-bles apply for the vacancy. (e) An agency component may place a component employee within the local commuting area in the vacancy after the component applies CTAP selection priority to its employees. (f) If there are two or more CTAP se- lection priority candidates for a va-cancy, the agency may place any of them. An agency may decide the spe-cific order of selection among CTAP se-lection priority candidates. For exam-ple, an agency may: (1) Provide a displaced candidate higher priority than a surplus can-didate; or (2) Provide an internal component candidate higher priority than another component’s candidate. (g) After an agency makes the va- cancy available to its CTAP eligibles and meets its obligation to any CTAP selection priority candidates, the agen-cy may place into the vacancy any other permanent competitive service candidate from within its workforce, under appropriate staffing procedures.

(i) An agency may deny a CTAP eligi- ble future selection priority if the eli-gible: (1) Declines an offer of a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service; or (2) Fails to respond within a reason- able period of time, as defined by the agency, to an offer of a permanent ap-pointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service. (j) Before appointing an individual from outside the agency’s permanent competitive service workforce, the agency must follow the requirements of subparts B and G of this part. § 330.608 Other agency CTAP respon- sibilities. (a) An agency must make a career transition orientation session available to all agency surplus and displaced em-ployees with information on selection priority under this subpart and sub-parts B and G. Such orientation ses-sions may be in person or web-based through an agency automated training system or intranet. (b) An agency must give each agency CTAP eligible written information on selection priority under its plan, ex-plaining how to locate and apply for agency vacancies and request selection priority. The agency may meet this re-quirement by providing a copy of its CTAP established under §330.603. (c) An agency must take reasonable steps to ensure that agency CTAP eli-gibles have access to information on all vacancies, including how CTAP eli-gibles can apply, what proof of eligi-bility is required, and the agency defi-nition of ‘‘well-qualified’’ for the va-cancy. (d) If the agency can document that there are no CTAP eligibles in a local commuting area, the agency need not post the vacancy for CTAP eligibles. (e) An agency must provide a CTAP eligible who applied for a specific va-cancy written notice of the final status of his or her application, including whether the eligible was determined to be well-qualified. The agency notice must include the results of the inde-pendent, second review under §330.605(b), if applicable; whether an-other CTAP selection priority can-didate was hired; whether the position was filled under an exception listed in §330.609; and whether the recruitment was cancelled. § 330.609 Exceptions to CTAP selection priority. An agency may take the following personnel actions as exceptions to §330.607: (a) Reemploy a former agency em- ployee with regulatory or statutory re-employment rights, including the re-employment of an injured worker who either has been restored to earning ca-pacity by the Office of Workers’ Com-pensation Programs, Department of Labor, or has received a notice that his or her compensation benefits will cease because of full recovery from the dis-abling injury or illness; (b) Reassign or demote an employee under part 432 or 752 of this chapter; (c) Appoint an individual for a period limited to 120 or fewer days, including all extensions; (d) Reassign agency employees be- tween or among positions in the local commuting area (sometimes called job swaps) when there is no change in grade or promotion potential and no actual vacancy results; (e) Convert an employee currently serving under an appointment pro-viding noncompetitive conversion eli-gibility to a competitive service ap-pointment, including from: (1) A Veterans Recruitment Appoint- ment under part 307 of this chapter; (2) An appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 and part 316 of this chapter of a veteran with a compensable service- connected disability of 30 percent or more; (3) Make an excepted service appoint- ment under part 213 of this chapter; and (4) A post-secondary student appoint- ment under 5 U.S.C. 3116 and part 316, subpart I, of this chapter; (f) Effect a personnel action under, or specifically in lieu of, part 351 of this chapter; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00239 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR230 5 CFR Ch.

An agen-cy shall not include a minimum edu-cational requirement in qualification standards, except for a scientific, tech-nical, or professional position the du-ties of which the agency decides cannot be performed by a person who does not have a prescribed minimum education. An agency shall not establish a max-imum age requirement for any posi-tion.

For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows: § 302.203 Standard and criteria for deter- mining fitness for employment in an Ex-cepted Service position. (a) The minimum standard and criteria for determining fitness for employment based on character and conduct are prescribed in part 731, subpart B, of this chapter. (b) Agencies may prescribe additional fac- tors to protect the integrity and promote the efficiency of the service when job-related and consistent with business necessity. Subpart C—Accepting, Rating, and Arranging Applications § 302.301 Receipt of applications. (a) Each agency shall establish defi- nite rules regarding the acceptance of applications for employment in posi-tions covered by this part and shall make these rules a matter of record. (b) Each agency shall apply its rules uniformly to all applicants who meet the conditions of the rules and shall furnish information concerning the rules to an applicant on his/her re-quest. § 302.302 Examination of applicants. (a) Eligibility. An evaluation of the qualifications of applicants for posi-tions covered by this part may be con-ducted at any time before an appoint-ment is made. The evaluation may in- volve only determination of eligibility or ineligibility or may include quali-tative rating of candidates. If the eval-uation involves only basic eligibility numerical scores will not be assigned and eligible candidates will be referred in accordance with the procedures de-scribed in paragraph (b)(5) of §302.304. If qualitative ranking is desired, numer-ical scores may be assigned in accord-ance with paragraph (b) of this section. Each agency shall make a part of the records the reasons for its decision to use ranked or unranked referral and, for ranked actions, the quality ranking factors used. This information shall be made available to an applicant on his/ her request. (b) Rating. Numerical scores will be assigned on a scale of 100. Each appli-cant who meets the qualification re-quirements for the position established under §302.202 will be assigned a rating of 70 or more and will be eligible for ap-pointment. Candidates scoring 70 or more will receive additional points for veteran preference as provided in §302.201. Numerical ratings are not re-quired when all qualified applicants will be offered immediate appointment. When there is an excessive number of applicants, numerical ratings are re-quired only for a sufficient number of the highest qualified applicants to meet the anticipated needs of the agen-cy within a reasonable period of time. The agency must, however, adopt pro-cedures to insure the consideration of preference eligibles in the order in which they would have been considered if all applicants had been assigned nu-merical ratings. An agency shall fur-nish a notice of the rating assigned to an applicant on his/her request. (c) Nonpreference applicants for certain positions. An agency may not consider or rate an application for the position of elevator operator, messenger, guard, or custodian submitted by a non-preference eligible as long as at least three qualified preference eligibles are available for the position. (d) Evaluating experience. When expe- rience is a factor in determining eligi-bility, an agency shall credit a pref-erence eligible (1) with time spent in the military service of the United States if the position for which he/she VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00159 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR150 5 CFR Ch.

(a) Establishment —(1) Agency’s obliga- tion. An agency must establish a pri- ority reemployment list whenever any applicants rated eligible under §302.302 meet the conditions set out in para-graphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this sec-tion and must consider candidates from that list in accordance with §302.304(a).

(c) For purposes of making any such determinations, positions includes: (1) Those that are intended to be re- moved indefinitely from the competi- tive service because the nature of the position itself precludes it from being in the competitive service (e.g., be-cause it is impracticable to examine for the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the job); and (2) Those that are intended to be re- moved temporarily from the competi-tive service to allow for targeted re-cruiting and hiring from among a par-ticular class of persons, as defined by the Office of Personnel Management, with the opportunity for the persons selected for those positions to convert to the competitive service at a later date.

(a) When OPM specifies that appoint- ments under a particular Schedule A, B, C, or D authority must be tem-porary, intermittent, or seasonal, or when agencies elect to make tem-porary, intermittent, or seasonal ap-pointments in Schedule A, B, C, or D, those terms have the following mean-ing: (1) Temporary appointments, unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, C, or D exception, are made for a specified period not to ex-ceed 1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section. Time-limited appointments made for more than 1 year are not considered to be temporary appointments, and are not subject to these time limits. (2) Intermittent positions are positions in which work recurs at sporadic or ir-regular intervals so that an employee’s tour of duty cannot be scheduled in ad-vance of the administrative workweek. (3) Seasonal positions involve annually recurring periods of employment last-ing less than 12 months each year. (b) Temporary appointments, as de- fined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are subject to the following limits: (1) Service limits. Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the appli-cable Schedule A, B, C, or D authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this sec-tion, agencies may extend temporary appointments for no more than 1 addi-tional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (i.e., a position that replaces and ab- sorbs the original position) is consid-ered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a posi-tion involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of the agency, and in the same local com-muting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment. (2) Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this sec-tion, an agency may not fill any posi-tion (or its successor) by a temporary appointment in Schedule A, B, C, or D if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.

(3) Exceptions to the general limits. The service limits and restrictions on refill-ing positions set out in this section do not apply when: (i) Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), ex-cluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employ-ee’s initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappoint-ment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An indi-vidual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial ap-pointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the serv-ice year limitation. (ii) Positions are filled under an au- thority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. These include the au-thorities set out in paragraphs (r) and (s) of §213.3102 and paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of §213.3402, and authorities granted to individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellow-ship, residency, or student programs. (iii) OPM approves extension of spe- cific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and un-usual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual cir-cumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving exten-sion of appointments to a specific posi-tion or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.

It addresses a specific procedural aspect of financial obligations within federal employment, which has direct implications for both employees and administrative personnel. The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of potential financial challenges federal workers might face and seeks clarity on voluntary debt resolution mechanisms.

The usefulness stems from several key factors:
1. Relevance: Directly relates to Title 5 financial regulations and employee debt management
2. Practicality: Addresses a real administrative process that employees might need to navigate
3. Applicability: Provides critical information for employees seeking to resolve financial obligations proactively
4. Complexity: Requires detailed knowledge of federal debt repayment procedures

HR specialists would find this question particularly valuable as it relates to administrative processes, while employees would benefit from understanding their options for managing outstanding debts without automatic salary deductions. The specificity of the question suggests a genuine need for precise regulatory information, making it a high-value inquiry for those navigating federal employment financial policies."
" How many administrative workweeks of paid parental leave are available, and what are the key conditions for using this leave?"," As outlined in §630.1703(b), an employee is entitled to 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave in connection with a birth or placement. Key conditions include: (1) The leave must be used within the 12-month period beginning on the date of birth or placement, (2) The employee must have a continuing parental role with the child, and (3) The leave can only be used to substitute for FMLA unpaid leave granted under specific Family and Medical Leave Act provisions.","['of the placement of an employee on weather and safety leave. (b) Reporting. In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record weather and safety leave under section 6329c and this sub-part as a category of leave separate from other types of leave. Subpart Q—Paid Parental Leave § 630.1701 Purpose, applicability, and agency responsibilities. (a) Purpose. This subpart provides regulations to govern the granting of paid parental leave to covered employ-ees. Since paid parental leave may only be substituted for unpaid leave granted following a birth or placement under specific provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act in title 5, United States Code—specifically, section 6382(a)(1)(A) and (B) in 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V—this subpart links to subpart L (Family and Medical Leave) of this part. (b) Applicability. (1) Except as other- wise provided in this paragraph (b), this subpart applies to employees to whom subpart L of this part applies, as provided in §630.1201(b). (2) An agency head authorized to issue regulations on family and med-ical leave under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V, as provided in §630.1201(b)(3), is authorized to issue any necessary supplemental regula-tions on paid parental leave, providing those supplemental regulations are consistent with the regulations in this subpart. (3) This subpart applies to a birth or placement occurring on or after Octo-ber 1, 2020. Paid parental leave may not be provided under this subpart for any period of time before October 1, 2020. (c) Agency responsibilities. The head of an agency having employees covered by this subpart is responsible for the prop-er administration of this subpart, in-cluding the responsibility of informing employees of their entitlements and obligations. § 630.1702 Definitions. (a) Applicability of subpart L defini- tions. The definitions of terms in §630.1202 are applicable in this subpart to the extent the terms are used, ex-cept that, to the extent any definitions of terms have been further revised in §630.1702(b), the provisions of that sec-tion shall apply for purposes of this subpart. (b) Other definitions. In this subpart— Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, excluding the Government Accountability Office. When the term ‘‘agency’’ is used in the context of an agency making deter-minations or taking actions, it means the agency head or management offi-cials who are authorized (including by delegation) to make the given deter-mination or take the given action. Birth or placement means the birth of a son or daughter of a covered em-ployee, or a new placement of a son or daughter with a covered employee for adoption or foster care, that is the basis for unpaid leave granted under §630.1203(a)(1) or (2) (which correspond to 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(1)(A) or (B), respec-tively). For the purpose of interpreting this definition, the terms birth and placement have the meanings given those terms in §630.1202, except that paid parental leave may not be granted VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00924 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR915 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1703 based on an anticipated birth or place- ment. Child means a son or daughter as de- fined in §630.1202 whose birth or place-ment is the basis for entitlement to paid parental leave. FMLA unpaid leave means leave with- out pay granted under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) regulations in subpart L of this part. Paid parental leave means paid time off from an employee’s scheduled tour of duty that is authorized under 5 U.S.C. 6382(d)(2)(B)(i) and this subpart and that is granted to cover periods of time within the 12-month period com-mencing on the date of birth or place-ment to an employee who has a current parental role in connection with the child whose birth or placement was the basis for granting FMLA unpaid leave under §630.1203(a)(1) or (2). This leave is not available to an employee who does not have a current parental role. § 630.1703 Leave entitlement. (a) Election. An employee may elect to substitute available paid parental leave for any FMLA unpaid leave granted under §630.1203(a)(1) or (2) (which correspond to 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(1)(A) or (B), respectively) in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement. (See §630.1206(b).) (b) Available paid parental leave. (1) The paid parental leave that is avail-able for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is 12 administrative work-weeks in connection with the birth or placement involved. The entitlement to paid parental leave is triggered by the occurrence of a birth or placement. The paid parental leave is considered to be available only if the employee has a continuing parental role with re-spect to the child whose birth or place-ment triggered the leave entitlement. The 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave may be used only during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement involved. (2) Since an employee may use only 12 weeks of FMLA unpaid leave in any 12-month period under §630.1203(a), use of FMLA unpaid leave not associated with paid parental leave may affect an employee’s ability to use the full 12 weeks of paid parental leave. Notwith-standing paragraph (b)(1) of this sec- tion, an employee will be able to use the full amount of paid parental leave only to the extent that there are 12 weeks of available FMLA unpaid leave granted under the birth or placement provisions in §630.1203(a)(1) or (2) dur-ing the 12-month period commencing on the date of birth or placement. The availability of paid parental leave will depend on when the employee uses var-ious types of FMLA unpaid leave rel-ative to any 12-month period estab-lished under §630.1203(c). (c) Conversion of weeks to hours. For employees who are charged leave on an hourly basis (including fractions of an hour), the 12 administrative workweeks referenced in paragraph (b) of this sec-tion must be converted to hours based on the number of hours in the employ-ee’s scheduled tour of duty (as in effect on the date the employee begins a pe-riod of using paid parental leave) as follows: (1) For a regular full-time employee with 80 hours in the scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is 480 hours. (2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in §630.201 and described in §630.210), the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the em-ployee’s biweekly scheduled tour of duty (or 6 times the average hours if the biweekly tour hours vary over an established cycle). For', 'a zero adjustment for an SL or ST em-ployee who has a current rating of record or applicable performance rat-ing at Level 3 or above, as described in §430.208 of this chapter, the agency must communicate the reasons for that decision to the employee in writing. (2) Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a senior professional with a rate of basic pay described in §534.505(c)(1) unless— (i) The rates of basic pay for the Ex- ecutive Schedule are also increased on the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and (ii) The senior professional has a cur- rent rating of record or applicable per-formance rating at Level 4 in an ap-praisal program that uses summary level pattern C or G, or at Level 5 in an appraisal program that uses summary level pattern B, E, F, or H, as described in §430.208 of this chapter. (3) Paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section may not be construed to re-quire a pay increase for any senior pro-fessional employee. § 534.508 Reductions in a rate of basic pay. (a) Any reduction in a rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee is sub-ject to part 752, subpart D of this chap-ter except as otherwise provided in this section. (b) If an employee is removed from an SL or ST position and placed in a General Schedule position under proce-dures in part 752, subpart D of this chapter or part 432 of this chapter pro-viding for reduction in grade, or other-wise moves voluntarily or involun-tarily to a General Schedule position, the employee is entitled to the min-imum rate of basic pay, as defined in §531.203 of this chapter, for the General Schedule grade unless the agency sets the employee’s pay at a higher rate under— (1) The maximum payable rate rule in §531.221 of this chapter, if applicable; (2) The superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in §531.212 of this chapter, if applicable; or (3) The pay retention rules in part 536, subpart C of this chapter, if appli-cable. (c) An agency may reduce an SL or ST employee’s rate of basic pay, sub-ject to part 752, subpart D of this chap-ter, upon movement to a different SL or ST position within the agency. If an SL or ST employee elects to accept a reduction in pay to facilitate a reas-signment and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting pay reduction is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter. (d) If an agency justifies an increase in an SL or ST employee’s rate of basic pay under §534.510 upon the employee’s movement to another SL or ST posi-tion having a substantially greater im-pact on agency performance with the understanding that the employee will be reduced to his or her former rate of basic pay upon movement out of the position, and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting reduction to the former rate of basic pay (or to a higher rate of basic pay determined under this sub-part that is within the pay range appli-cable to the SL or ST position under §534.504(a)) is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter. (e) A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee under §534.506(b) upon transfer is considered voluntary upon the employee’s accept-ance of the appointment and is not sub-ject to part 752, subpart D of this chap-ter, except that an SL or ST employ-ee’s rate of basic pay may not be re-duced upon transfer under cir-cumstances described in §534.509(a). A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee upon a transfer of function under part 351, subpart C of this chapter from another agency is subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter unless otherwise provided by statute. § 534.509 Preservation of an estab- lished rate of basic pay.

(b) An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay because his or her agency’s applicable perform-ance appraisal system certification ex-pires or is suspended under §430.405(h) of this chapter. See §530.203(g) and (h) of this chapter for treatment of the ag-gregate pay limit when certification status changes during the calendar year. (c) An agency may continue an SL or ST employee’s rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule upon that employee’s move-ment within the agency to an SL or ST position that is not under a certified performance appraisal system. Pay may be reduced upon the movement only as provided in §534.508. (d) If an agency grants a temporary pay increase under conditions de-scribed in §534.508(d) to an SL or ST employee subject to a certified per-formance appraisal system who, prior to the temporary pay increase, has a rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, the agency may return the employee to an SL or ST position that is not subject to a certified performance appraisal sys-tem when the temporary assignment ends and set the SL or ST employee’s rate of basic pay at the rate in effect immediately before the temporary pay increase. (e) When a rate of basic pay that is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule is preserved under a provision of this section, the SL or ST employee will continue to receive his or her current rate of basic pay and is not eligible for a pay increase until he or she is assigned to an SL or ST po-sition covered by a certified perform-ance appraisal system or his or her rate of basic pay is less than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. (f) An agency that is otherwise sub- ject to the limitation in §534.504(a)(2)(i) with respect to an SL or ST position', 'regardless of when performed but not including periods of active duty for training.

Section 7116(a)(7), agencies may implement revised §351.504 at any time between December 24, 1997 and October 1, 1998. For reduction in force actions effective between December 24, 1997 and September 30, 1998, agencies may use either §351.504 effective December 24, 1997, or the prior §351.504 in 5 CFR part 351 (January 1, 1997 edition). (a) Ratings used. (1) Only ratings of record as defined in §351.203 shall be used as the basis for granting addi-tional retention service credit in a re-duction in force. (2) For employees who received rat- ings of record while covered by part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those ratings of record shall be used to grant additional retention service credit in a reduction in force. (3) For employees who received per- formance ratings while not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those performance ratings shall be con-sidered ratings of record for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force only when it is de- termined that those performance rat-ings are', 'a lower rate. How-ever, the employee’s rate may not be lower than the rate to which he or she is entitled under any other applicable pay-setting rule. (3) In applying this section, an agen- cy must use applicable annual rates of pay or, if a rate under a non-GS system is an hourly rate, convert the hourly rate to an annual rate. (4) In applying this section, an agen- cy must treat a critical position pay rate under 5 CFR part 535 as if it were a rate under a non-GS pay system, as described in paragraph (d) of this sec-tion. (5) In applying this section, an agen- cy must treat an adjusted GS rate that includes market pay under 38 U.S.C. 7431(c) as if it were a rate under a non- GS pay system, as described in para-graph (d) of this section. (6) Before setting pay under this sec- tion, an agency must establish a policy on its use of the maximum payable rate rule that includes— (i) Designation of officials with the authority to approve and set pay under this section; (ii) Any situations in which the agen- cy must use the authority; (iii) Any situations in which the agency may exercise its discretion in using the authority; (iv) Consideration of the step at which pay has been set for other em-ployees performing similar work in the organization (based on the position’s occupational series, grade level, types of duties, or other job-relevant factors) and any other factors the designated official(s) may or must consider in de-termining the step at which to set the employee’s pay between the employee’s entitlement under any other applicable pay-setting rule and the employee’s maximum payable rate; and (v) Documentation and record- keeping requirements sufficient to allow reconstruction of the action. (b) When highest previous rate is based on a GS rate or LEO special base rate. When an employee’s highest previous rate (as determined under §531.222) is based on a GS rate or an LEO special base rate paid under the GS pay sys-tem, an agency must determine the maximum payable rate of basic pay that may be paid to the employee as follows: (1) Compare the employee’s highest previous rate with the GS rates for the grade in which pay is currently being set. For this comparison, use the schedule of GS rates in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. In applying this paragraph to an employee who was a law enforce-ment officer receiving an LEO special base rate when the highest previous rate was earned, compare the highest previous rate to the applicable LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates if the grade in which pay is currently being set is one of the grades from GS– 3 through GS–10. (2) Identify the lowest step in the grade at which the GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if applicable) was equal to or greater than the employee’s highest previous rate. If the employee’s highest previous rate was greater than the maximum GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if applicable) for the grade, identify the step 10 rate ( i.e., maximum rate of the grade). (3) Identify the rate on the currently applicable range of GS rates or LEO special base rates for the employee’s current position of record and grade that corresponds to the step identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate or LEO special base rate the agency may pay the employee under this sec-tion. (4) After setting the employee’s GS or LEO special base rate within the rate range for the grade (not to exceed the maximum payable rate identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), the agency must determine the employee’s payable rate of basic pay based on the employee’s GS or LEO special base rate. (c) When highest previous rate is based on a GS employee’s special rate. When a GS employee is reassigned under the conditions described in §531.222(c), the employee’s former special rate in effect immediately before the reassignment may be used as the employee’s highest previous rate.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 531.221 special rate schedule is being adjusted on the effective date of the employee’s reassignment, the agency must deter-mine what the employee’s special rate would have been on that adjusted schedule (before any other simulta-neous action) and treat the resulting special rate as the employee’s former special rate in applying paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The agen-cy must apply the maximum payable rate rule as follows: (1) When the employee is assigned to an official worksite within the geo-graphic boundaries of a formerly appli-cable special rate schedule, compare the former special rate to the rates of basic pay in the highest applicable rate range for the employee’s current posi-tion of record and current official worksite. Identify the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the former special rate (or the max-imum step rate, if the former special rate exceeds the range maximum). That step rate is the employee’s max-imum payable rate of basic pay. (2) When the employee is assigned to an official worksite outside the geo-graphic boundaries of the formerly ap-plicable special rate schedule, deter-mine the maximum payable rate as fol-lows: (i) Convert the former special rate to a corresponding rate (same step) in the current highest applicable rate range for the new official worksite based on the employee’s position of record im-mediately before the reassignment. (ii) If the rate resulting from the geo- graphic conversion under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is a special rate, that converted special rate is deemed to be the employee’s former special rate and highest previous rate in apply-ing paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. If the resulting rate is not a special rate, this paragraph (c) may not be used to determine the employee’s max-imum payable rate. Instead, paragraph (b) of this section must be used. (iii) Compare the employee’s highest previous rate ( i.e., the former special rate after the geographic conversion) with the rates on the current highest applicable rate range for the new offi-cial worksite based on the employee’s position of record after the reassign-ment. Identify the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate (or the maximum step rate, if the highest previous rate exceeds the range maximum).

It directly addresses a critical benefit under Title 5 that impacts federal employees who are new parents. The question seeks specific, actionable information about paid parental leave, which is an important policy area for:

1. HR Specialists: Need to understand and correctly implement leave policies
2. Managers: Must know how to support employees taking parental leave
3. Federal Employees: Want to understand their entitlements and conditions for using this benefit
4. Family Planning Employees: Critical information for career and family planning decisions

The question covers both the quantitative aspect (number of workweeks) and the qualitative conditions, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to understanding this specific federal employment benefit. It reflects a genuine information need that has direct practical implications for workforce management and employee welfare.

The topic of paid parental leave is particularly significant as it relates to work-life balance, employee retention, and supporting federal employees during important life transitions. By seeking clarity on both the duration and key conditions, the question shows a nuanced approach to understanding this complex employment benefit."

OPM obtains from the shel- ter survey, a survey of Federal employ-ees, or other appropriate sources, infor-mation on dwelling size and the types and prevalence of heating and cooling equipment and energy types (e.g., elec-tricity, gas, and oil) in each area. (3) Step 3. OPM computes estimates of total home energy requirements by en-ergy type attributable to heating and cooling plus all other household energy uses for the COLA survey area and the Washington, DC, area. (4) Step 4. OPM surveys utility prices for each major energy type appropriate to the area. (5) Step 5. OPM combines the above data to produce for each COLA survey area the cost of maintaining the stand-ard size dwelling at a given ambient temperature and the cost of other household energy uses. (6) Step 6. OPM compares the COLA survey area cost with the DC area cost to produce a price index. § 591.221 How does OPM compute the consumer expenditure weights it uses to combine price indexes? OPM uses the following ten-step process to compute consumer expendi-ture weights: (a) Step 1. OPM obtains the latest BLS tabulated CES data nationwide and for the Washington, DC, area. (b) Step 2. In both the nationwide and DC area tabulated data, OPM replaces the homeowners’ expenditures for shel-ter with estimated rental values of owned homes that are available else-where in tabulated CES data. Note: These replacements are consistent with the rental equivalence approach de-scribed in §591.219. (c) Step 3. OPM selects the central in- come groups in the nationwide CES tabulation. (d) Step 4. OPM calculates the ex- penditure shares ( i.e., percentages) for each central income group by dividing each of its DEC expenditures by total expenditures for the income group. OPM also calculates expenditure shares for total nationwide expenditures by dividing each nationwide DEC expendi-ture by total nationwide expenditures. (e) Step 5. OPM computes a demo- cratic distribution of expenditure shares by averaging the central income groups’ shares at each DEC and higher level of aggregation. (f) Step 6. OPM computes a set of ra- tios by dividing each expenditure share of the nationwide democratic distribu-tion by the corresponding expenditure share of the total national distribu-tion. (g) Step 7. OPM computes estimated expenditures for Washington DC for each DC DEC and higher level of aggre-gation that BLS reported by multi-plying the reported expenditure by the corresponding ratio derived in Step 6. (h) Step 8. For each DC DEC and high- er level of aggregation that BLS did not report, OPM computes expendi-tures for DC by distributing the DC ex-penditure calculated in step 7 using the distribution of expenditure shares de-rived in step 5. (i) Step 9. As described in §591.211(c), OPM classifies each DEC and aggregate into PEGs. (j) Step 10. OPM computes expendi- ture weights by dividing each DEC or aggregate by the total expenditure de-rived from the DC expenditure com-puted in step 8. Therefore, the sum of the MEGs, PEGs, and DECs, will sepa-rately total 100, i.e., so that all con- sumer expenditures in the original tab- ulation are accounted for. § 591.222 How does OPM use the ex- penditure weights to combine price indexes? OPM uses a three-step process to combine price indexes. (a) Step 1. For each DEC represented by one or more items for which OPM could make valid price comparisons (e.g., OPM was able to collect rep-resentative prices in both the COLA and DC areas), OPM computes the unweighted geometric average (the nth root of the product of n numbers) of the price index(es) of all item(s) rep-resenting the DEC. (b) Step 2. OPM multiplies the price index for each DEC by its expenditure weight, sums the cross products, and divides by the sum of the weights used in the calculation. This produces a price index for the level of aggregation (e.g., PEG or sub-PEG) in which the DEC is categorized.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 591.223 (c) Step 3. OPM repeats the process described in Step 2 at each level of ag-gregation within the PEG to produce a price index for the PEG, at the PEG level to produce an index for the MEG, and at the MEG level to produce the overall price index for the COLA area. [67 FR 22340, May 3, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 59763, Oct. 6, 2004] § 591.223 When does OPM conduct COLA surveys? (a) OPM conducts a survey in each COLA area once every 3 years on a ro-tational basis and surveys the Wash-ington, DC, area concurrently with each COLA area survey. The order of the COLA area surveys is as follows: (1) Year 1. All COLA areas in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (2) Year 2. All COLA areas in the State of Alaska, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (3) Year 3. All COLA areas in the State of Hawaii and the Territory of Guam and CNMI. (b) Exceptions: (1) Nothing in this subpart precludes OPM from conducting interim surveys or implementing some other change in response to conditions caused by a nat-ural disaster or similar emergency, provided OPM publishes a notice or rule in the F EDERAL REGISTER explain- ing the change and the reason(s) for it. (2) As provided in §591.215(c), OPM does not conduct surveys in the Rest of the State of Alaska COLA area unless COLA rate reductions appear war-ranted. § 591.224 How does OPM adjust price indexes between surveys? (a) OPM adjusts price indexes be- tween the triennial surveys in each COLA area that is not surveyed in that year. To do this, OPM uses the annual or biennial change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the COLA area relative to the annual or biennial change in the CPI for the Washington, DC, area. OPM uses the annual change for those areas surveyed the preceding year. OPM uses the biennial change for those areas surveyed 2 years before.

Time spent at a temporary duty sta-tion between arrival and departure is not time in a travel status. Time in a travel status ends when the employee arrives at the temporary duty worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty station, wherever the employee arrives first. Time in a travel status re-sumes when an employee departs from the temporary duty worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty sta-tion, from whichever the employee de-parts last. Travel time in connection with an employee’s permanent change of station is not time in a travel sta-tus. Determinations regarding what is creditable as ‘‘usual waiting time’’ are within the sole and exclusive discretion of the employing agency. (2) If an employee experiences an ex- tended ( i.e., not usual) waiting time be- tween actual periods of travel during which the employee is free to rest, sleep, or otherwise use the time for his or her own purposes, the extended waiting time is not creditable as time in a travel status. (c) Travel between home and a tem- porary duty station. (1) If an employee is required to travel directly between his or her home and a temporary duty sta-tion outside the limits of the employ-ee’s official duty station, the travel time is creditable as time in a travel status if otherwise qualifying under this subpart. However, the agency must deduct from such travel hours the time the employee would have spent in normal home-to-work or work-to-home commuting. (2) In the case of an employee who is offered one mode of transportation and who is permitted to use an alternative mode of transportation, or who travels at a time or by a route other than that selected by the agency, the agency must determine the estimated amount of time in a travel status the employee would have had if the employee had used the mode of transportation offered by the agency or traveled at the time or by the route selected by the agency. In determining time in a travel status under this subpart, the agency must credit the employee with the lesser of the estimated time in a travel status or the actual time in a travel status. (3) In the case of an employee who is on a multiple-day travel assignment and who chooses, for personal reasons, not to use temporary lodgings at the temporary duty station, but to return home at night or on a weekend, only travel from home to the temporary duty station on the 1st day and travel from the temporary duty station to home on the last day that is otherwise qualifying as time in a travel status under this subpart is mandatorily cred-itable (subject to the deduction of nor-mal commuting time). Travel to and from home on other days is not cred-itable travel time unless the agency, at its discretion, determines that credit should be given based on the net sav-ings to the Government from reduced lodging costs, considering the value of lost labor time attributable to compen-satory time off. The dollar value of an hour of compensatory time off for this purpose is equal to the employee’s hourly rate of basic pay as defined in §550.103. (d) Time spent traveling to or from a transportation terminal as part of travel away from the official duty station. If an employee is required to travel between home and a transportation terminal (e.g., airport or train station) within the limits of his or her official duty station as part of travel away from that duty station, the travel time out-side regular working hours to or from the terminal is considered to be equiv-alent to commuting time and is not creditable time in a travel status. If the transportation terminal is outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station, the travel time to or from the terminal outside regular working hours is creditable as time in a travel status, but is subject to an off-set for the time the employee would have spent in normal home-to-work or work-to-home commuting. If the em-ployee travels between a worksite and a transportation terminal, the travel time outside regular working hours is creditable as time in a travel status, and no commuting time offset applies. (e) Travel involving two or more time zones. When an employee’s travel in- volves two or more time zones, the time zone from the point of first depar-ture must be used to determine how many hours the employee actually VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00681 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR672 5 CFR Ch.

Subpart D—Performance Ap- praisal Certification for Pay Purposes SOURCE : 69 FR 45550, 45551, July 29, 2004, un- less otherwise noted. NOTE TO SUBPART D: Regulations identical to this subpart appear at 5 CFR part 1330, subpart D. § 430.401 Purpose. (a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5307(d), as added by section 1322 of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 (Title XIII of Public Law 107–296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002; No-vember 25, 2002), which provides a high-er aggregate limitation on pay for cer-tain members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5383 and employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) posi-tions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. In addi-tion, this subpart is necessary to ad-minister rates of basic pay for mem-bers of the SES under 5 U.S.C. 5382, as amended by section 1125 of the Na- tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The regulations in this subpart strengthen the application of pay-for-performance principles to senior executives and senior profes-sionals. Specifically, the statutory pro-visions authorize an agency to apply a higher maximum rate of basic pay for senior executives (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effec-tive) and apply a higher aggregate lim-itation on pay (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B) to its senior em-ployees, but only after OPM, with OMB concurrence, has certified that the de-sign and application of the agency’s ap-praisal systems for these employees make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. This subpart es-tablishes the certification criteria and procedures that OPM will apply in con-sidering agency requests for such cer-tification. (b) Senior executives generally may receive an annual rate of basic pay up to the rate for level III of the Execu-tive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effec-tive. Senior employees generally may receive total compensation in a cal-endar year up to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C.

(c) An employee becomes ineligible for student loan repayment benefits under the conditions described in §537.108. § 537.105 Criteria for payment. (a) General criteria. Before author- izing student loan repayment benefits for an employee (or job candidate), an agency must make a written deter-mination that— (1) The employee (or job candidate) is highly qualified and otherwise eligible (as described in §537.104); and (2)(i) In a case where the authoriza- tion is granted to recruit a job can-didate to fill an agency position, the agency otherwise would encounter dif-ficulty in filling a position with a high-ly qualified individual; or (ii) In a case where the authorization is granted to retain a current employee of the agency, the employee otherwise is likely to leave the agency for em-ployment outside the Federal service and it is essential to retain the em-ployee based on the employee’s high or unique qualifications or a special need of the agency. (b) Retention considerations. In mak- ing a determination under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, an agency must consider the extent to which the employee’s departure would affect the agency’s ability to carry out an activ-ity or perform a function that is deemed essential to its mission. (c) Current Federal employees. An agency may not authorize student loan repayment benefits to recruit an indi-vidual from outside the agency who is currently employed in the Federal service. (d) Selection. When selecting employ- ees (or job candidates) to receive stu-dent loan repayment benefits, agencies must ensure that benefits are awarded without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as de-fined by the Age Discrimination in Em-ployment Act of 1967, as amended), dis-ability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital sta-tus, political affiliation, sexual ori-entation, labor affiliation or nonaffili- ation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, unless specifi-cally designated by statute as a factor that must be taken into consideration when awarding such benefits, or retal-iation for exercising rights with re-spect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available.

(1) Student loan repayment benefits may be pro-vided at the discretion of the agency and are subject to such terms, limita-tions, or conditions as may be mutu-ally agreed to in writing by the agency and the employee (or job candidate) as part of a service agreement under §537.107. (2) The student loan to be repaid must be a qualifying student loan as set forth in paragraph (b) of this sec-tion. (3) The agency must document in writing each approval of student loan repayment benefits. An authorized agency official must review and ap-prove each written determination. The written determination must show the employee (or job candidate) meets the criteria specified in §537.105. (4) An authorized agency official must approve student loan repayment benefits in connection with a recruit-ment action before the job candidate actually enters on duty in the position for which he or she was recruited. The agency and the job candidate may sign the service agreement consistent with §537.107 before the job candidate begins serving in the position, but the agency may not begin making loan payments until the job candidate begins serving in the position. (5) Student loan repayment benefits are in addition to basic pay and any other form of compensation otherwise payable to the employee involved.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 537.107 student loan repayment benefit, agen- cies may lessen the impact of tax withholdings on an employee’s pay-check in one of the following ways: (i) Make smaller payments at peri- odic intervals throughout the year, rather than issue payments under this part in one lump sum; (ii) Allow the employee to write a check to the agency to cover his or her tax liability, rather than have the tax liability withheld from the employee’s paycheck; (iii) Deduct the amount of taxes to be withheld from the student loan repay-ment benefit before the balance is issued as a loan payment to the holder of the loan. NOTE TO §537.106(a)(6): Contact the Internal Revenue Service for further details con-cerning these options, as well as the tax withholding implications of payments under this part. (b) Qualifying student loans. (1) The agency may make loan payments only for student loan debts that are out-standing at the time the agency and the employee (or job candidate) enter into a service agreement. Before au-thorizing loan payments, an agency must verify with the holder of the loan that the employee (or job candidate) has an outstanding student loan that qualifies for repayment under this part. The agency must verify remain-ing balances to ensure that loans are not overpaid. (2) The agency may repay more than one loan if the employee’s student loan repayment benefit does not exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. (3) These regulations do not impose a limit on the age of a student loan for qualification purposes. The agency may, however, specify in its agency plan that only student loans made within a certain timeframe are eligible for repayment.

It directly addresses performance management documentation requirements under Title 5, which is crucial for HR specialists, managers, and employees. The question seeks specific information about record-keeping practices that have significant implications for performance evaluations, potential grievances, career progression, and legal compliance. 

For HR professionals, understanding document retention requirements is essential for maintaining proper personnel records and ensuring regulatory compliance. For managers, knowing what documents must be retained helps them understand the formal documentation process for performance evaluations. For employees, this information provides transparency about what performance-related documents are maintained in their official files, which can be important for career development, potential appeals, or understanding their professional record.

The question is practical, directly applicable to federal workplace processes, and addresses a concrete information need related to performance management documentation. It demonstrates a clear intent to understand the specifics of record-keeping requirements, making it extremely valuable for anyone involved in or studying federal employment practices."

An agency must maintain an ac- curate record of an employee’s usage of administrative leave by recording leave in one of the following subcat-egories, as applicable in the case at hand: (1) Administrative leave used for the purposes of an investigation (as de-scribed in §630.1404(a)); or (2) Administrative leave used for all other purposes. (b) Minimum retention period. An agen- cy must retain the records described in paragraph (a) of this section for a min-imum of 6 years from the date the leave was used. (c) Reporting. (1) In agency data sys- tems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record administrative leave under section 6329a and this sub-part as categories of leave separate from other types of leave. Leave under section 6329a and this subpart must be recorded as either administrative leave used for the purposes of an investiga-tion (as described in §630.1404(a)) or ad-ministrative leave used for all other purposes, as applicable.

(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329b, which allows an agency to pro-vide separate types of paid leave for employees who are the subject of an in-vestigation or in a notice period. OPM has authority to prescribe imple-menting regulations under 5 U.S.C. 6329b(h)(1). (b) This subpart applies to an em- ployee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is employed in an agency, excluding— (1) An Inspector General; or (2) An intermittent employee who, by definition, does not have an established regular tour of duty during the admin-istrative workweek.

In this subpart: Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C.105, excluding the Government Accountability Office. When the term ‘‘agency’’ is used in the context of an agency making deter-minations or taking actions, it means the agency head or management offi-cials who are authorized (including by delegation) to make the given deter-mination or take the given action. Chief Human Capital Officer or CHCO means the Chief Human Capital Officer of an agency designated or appointed under 5 U.S.C 1401, or the equivalent. Committee of jurisdiction means, with respect to an agency, each committee of the Senate or House of', 'for holiday work is in addition to overtime pay or night pay differential, or premium pay for Sunday work payable under this sub-part and is not included in the rate of basic pay used to compute the over-time pay or night pay differential or premium pay for Sunday work. (b) Notwithstanding premium pay for holiday work, the number of hours of holiday work are included in deter-mining for overtime pay purposes the total number of hours of work per-formed in the administrative work-week in which the holiday occurs. (c) The number of regularly sched- uled hours of duty on a holiday that fall within an employee’s basic work-week on which the employee is excused from duty are part of the basic work-week for overtime pay computation purposes. (d) For a Border Patrol agent covered by 5 U.S.C. 5550 and subpart P of this part, no holiday premium pay is pay-able for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the agent’s regular tour of duty, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5550(b)(2)(C), (b)(3)(C), and (c)(1)(A). The overtime supplement payable for such scheduled overtime hours is not part of the agent’s rate of basic pay used in computing the holiday premium pay for other hours that qualify for such premium pay. [33 FR 12458, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 80 FR 58111, Sept. 25, 2015] REGULARLY SCHEDULED STANDBY DUTY PAY § 550.141 Authorization of premium pay on an annual basis. An agency may pay premium pay on an annual basis, instead of the pre-mium pay prescribed in this subpart for regularly scheduled overtime, night, holiday, and Sunday work, to an employee in a position requiring him or her regularly to remain at, or within the confines of, his or her station dur-ing longer than ordinary periods of duty, a substantial part of which con-sists of remaining in a standby status rather than performing work. Premium pay under this section is determined as an appropriate percentage, not in ex-cess of 25 percent, of that part of the employee’s rate of basic pay which does not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–10 (including any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or special rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar pro-vision of law). [56 FR 20342, May 3, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 3542, Feb. 1, 1996] § 550.142 General restrictions. An agency may pay premium pay under §550.141 only if that premium pay, over a period appropriate to re-flect the full cycle of the employee’s duties and the full range of conditions in his position, would be: (a) More than the premium pay which would otherwise be payable under this subpart for the hours of ac-tual work customarily required in his position, excluding standby time dur-ing which he performs no work; and (b) Less than the premium pay which would otherwise be payable under this subpart for the hours of duty required in his position, including standby time during which he performs no work. § 550.143 Bases for determining posi- tions for which premium pay under § 550.141 is authorized. (a) The requirement for the type of position referred to in §550.141 that an employee regularly remain at, or with-in the confines of, his station must meet all the following conditions: (1) The requirement must be definite and the employee must be officially or- dered to remain at his station. The em-ployee’s remaining at his station must not be merely voluntary, desirable, or a result of geographic isolation, or solely because the employee lives on the grounds.

This tour of duty must be established on a regularly recurring basis over a substantial period of time, generally at least a few months. The requirement must not be occasional, irregular, or for a brief period. (3) The requirement must be associ- ated with the regularly assigned duties of the employee’s job, either as a con-tinuation of his regular work which in-cludes standby time, or as a require-ment to stand by at his post to perform his regularly assigned duties if the ne-cessity arises. (b) The words ‘‘at, or within the con- fines, of his station’’, in §550.141 mean one of the following: (1) At an employee’s regular duty station. (2) In quarters provided by an agency, which are not the employee’s ordinary living quarters, and which are specifi-cally provided for use of personnel re-quired to stand by in readiness to per-form actual work when the need arises or when called. (3) In an employee’s living quarters, when designated by the agency as his duty station and when his whereabouts is narrowly limited and his activities are substantially restricted. This con-dition exists only during periods when an employee is required to remain at his quarters and is required to hold himself in a state of readiness to an-swer calls for his services. This limita-tion on an employee’s whereabouts and activities is distinguished from the limitation placed on an employee who is subject to call outside his tour of duty but may leave his quarters pro-vided he arranges for someone else to respond to calls or leaves a telephone number by which he can be reached should his services be required. (c) The words ‘‘longer than ordinary periods of duty’’ in §550.141 mean more than 40 hours a week. (d) The words ‘‘a substantial part of which consists of remaining in a stand-by status rather than performing work’’ in §550.141 refer to the entire tour of duty. This requirement is met: (1) When a substantial part of the en- tire tour of duty, at least 25 percent, is spent in a standby status which occurs throughout the entire tour; (2) If certain hours of the tour of duty are regularly devoted to actual work and others are spent in a standby sta-tus, that part of the tour of duty de-voted to standing by is at least 25 per-cent of the entire tour of duty; or (3) When an employee has a basic workweek requiring full-time perform-ance of actual work and is required, in addition, to perform standby duty on certain nights, or to perform standby duty on certain days not included in his basic workweek. (e) An employee is in a standby sta- tus, as referred to in §550.141, only at times when he is not required to per-form actual work and is free to', 'and Records Administration (Parts 2600—2699) XXVII Small Business Administration (Parts 2700—2799) XXVIII Department of Justice (Parts 2800—2899) XXIX Department of Labor (Parts 2900—2999) XXX Department of Homeland Security (Parts 3000—3099) XXXI Institute of Museum and Library Services (Parts 3100—3199) XXXII National Endowment for the Arts (Parts 3200—3299) XXXIII National Endowment for the Humanities (Parts 3300—3399) XXXIV Department of Education (Parts 3400—3499) XXXV Export-Import Bank of the United States (Parts 3500—3599) XXXVI Office of National Drug Control Policy, Executive Office of the President (Parts 3600—3699) XXXVII Peace Corps (Parts 3700—3799) LVIII Election Assistance Commission (Parts 5800—5899) LIX Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (Parts 5900—5999) LX Federal Communications Commission (Parts 6000—6099) Title 3—The President I Executive Office of the President (Parts 100—199) Title 4—Accounts I Government Accountability Office (Parts 1—199) Title 5—Administrative Personnel I Office of Personnel Management (Parts 1—1199) II Merit Systems Protection Board (Parts 1200—1299) III Office of Management and Budget (Parts 1300—1399) IV Office of Personnel Management and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (Parts 1400—1499) V The International Organizations Employees Loyalty Board (Parts 1500—1599) VI Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Parts 1600—1699) VIII Office of Special Counsel (Parts 1800—1899) IX Appalachian Regional Commission (Parts 1900—1999) XI Armed Forces Retirement Home (Parts 2100—2199) XIV Federal Labor Relations Authority, General Counsel of the Fed- eral Labor Relations Authority and Federal Service Impasses Panel (Parts 2400—2499) XVI Office of Government Ethics (Parts 2600—2699) XXI Department of the Treasury (Parts 3100—3199) XXII Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (Parts 3200—3299) VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00934 Fmt 8092 Sfmt 8092 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR925 Chap.

The agency will furnish the employee with a copy of the written agreement which must con-tain a statement of the time limits for exercising reemployment rights and the conditions of reemployment. § 352.904 Eligibility. This subpart covers only eligible em- ployees transferred or detailed to Com-mission positions with duty stations in the Republic of Panama. (a) Employees eligible. Except as pro- vided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee serving in a position in an agency under any of the following ap-pointments may be granted rights under this subpart: (1) Career or career-conditional ap- pointment in the competitive service; (2) An appointment without a specific time limit in the excepted service; or (3) A career appointment in the Sen- ior Executive Service.

[50 FR 13963, Apr. 9, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 10125, Mar. 24, 1992] § 352.905 Employees on detail. (a) An employee detailed to the Com- mission is subject to the same condi-tions of employment at his or her em-ploying agency as if the employee has not been detailed. (b) The Commission and the employ- ing agency will arrange for the termi-nation of a detail and the agency will return the employee to his or her former position or an equivalent one as provided in §352.908 (b) and (c). § 352.906 Termination of transfer. At the conclusion of a term of em- ployment agreed upon as provided in §352.903, employment with the Commis-sion may be terminated without regard to parts 351, 359, 432, 752, or 771 of this chapter. § 352.907 Exercise or termination of re- employment rights. (a) Exercise. An individual who has been transferred under this subpart to the Commission and wishes to be reem-ployed must apply in writing to the former employing agency. The time limits for application for reemploy-ment are— (1) No later than 30 calendar days after the expiration of the term of em-ployment with the Commission; (2) No later than 30 calendar days after receipt of notice of involuntary separation during the term of employ-ment with the Commission; or (3) No later than 30 calendar days after resignation with the consent of the Commission.

Wage surveys are critical for determining pay scales, cost-of-living adjustments, and ensuring competitive compensation for federal employees across different regions and job classifications. The question demonstrates a practical information need that would be valuable to:

1. HR specialists responsible for compensation planning
2. Federal employees seeking to understand how their pay is determined
3. Managers involved in workforce compensation strategies
4. Policymakers analyzing federal pay systems

The question seeks substantive knowledge about the frequency and types of wage surveys, which directly impacts federal employee compensation. It addresses a concrete aspect of federal employment policy that has real-world implications for workforce management and employee compensation. While not addressing the most critical aspects of federal employment (like retirement or leave), it still provides important insights into how federal pay systems are maintained and adjusted.

The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for detailed information about federal compensation mechanisms, making it a valuable inquiry for those interested in understanding the intricacies of federal employee wage determination."
" If a federal employee is part of a reduction in force (RIF) and declines to transfer with their function to another competitive area, what are their potential outcomes?
"," Per § 351.302, if an employee declines to transfer with their function, the losing competitive area has two primary options:
1. Use adverse action procedures to separate the employee (under 5 CFR part 752)
2. Include the employee as part of a concurrent reduction in force

Additionally, the agency cannot separate the employee any sooner than employees who chose to transfer. The employee's separation is contingent on the transfer of other employees with the function. If the transfer occurs to a different local commuting area, the agency may first send a canvass letter asking about the employee's transfer preference, with the employee able to change an initial acceptance without penalty, but unable to change an initial declination.","['Subpart F—Job Grading System § 532.601 General.

(1) The provisions of the system shall be published and the agency’s employ-ees shall be informed where a published copy is available for review. (2) An application shall be in writing and contain the reasons the employee believes the position is erroneously graded. (3) An application may be filed at any time. However, when the application involves a downgrading or other job- grading action which resulted in a re-duction in grade or loss or pay, in order to be entitled to retroactive corrective action, an employee must request a re-view under the provisions of this sub-part within 15 calendar days of the ef-fective date of the change to lower grade. (4) An employee may select a rep- resentative, and the employee and the representative, when the representa-tive is also employed by the same agen-cy, shall be granted a reasonable time in presenting the application and shall be assured freedom from restraint, in-terference, coercion, or reprisal in pre-senting the application. (5) An employee shall promptly fur- nish such facts as may be requested by the agency. (6) An application shall be canceled and the employee so notified in the fol-lowing circumstances: (i) On receipt of a written request by the employee; (ii) Failure of the employee to fur- nish required information or otherwise fail to proceed with the advancement of his application in a timely manner; however, instead of cancellation for failure by the employee to prosecute, the application may be adjudicated by the agency if the information is suffi-cient for that purpose; or (iii) On notice that the employee has left the job, except when the employee would be entitled to the retroactive benefits including benefits allowable after the death of an employee appel-lant. (7) The application shall be processed and decided promptly. No more than one level of review may be established within an agency before a final deci-sion is issued, and that level of review, when possible, must be above the level of classification authority which clas- sified the position. (8) When an employee applies for a review of a downgrading or other job- grading action that resulted in a reduc-tion of pay, and the decision of an agency reverses in whole or in part the downgrading or other job-grading ac-tion, the effective date of that decision shall be retroactive to the effective date of the action being reviewed when the initial application to the agency was submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. How-ever, when the agency decision raises the grade or level of the job above its grade or level immediately preceding the downgrading, retroactivity shall apply only to the extent of restoration to the grade or level immediately pre-ceding the downgrading. (9) The right to a retroactive effec- tive date is preserved when an agency finds that an employee was not notified of the applicable time limit for review and was not otherwise aware of the limit or that circumstances beyond the employee’s control prevented filing the application within the prescribed time limit. (10) The effective date of a change in the series, title or grade of a job shall be specified in the agency decision and, unless otherwise required by this sub-part, may not be earlier than the date of the decision. However, in no case may it be later than the beginning of the first pay period which begins after the 60th calendar day from the date the application was filed. However, when the agency decision will result in a downgrading or other job-grading ac-tion that will reduce the pay of the in-cumbent of the job, the effective date may not be set earlier than the date on which the decision can be effected in accordance with procedures required by applicable law and regulation.

(a) Under procedures established by the leave recipient’s employing agency, any transferred annual leave remaining to the credit of a leave recipient when the medical emergency terminates shall be restored, as provided in para-graphs (b) and (c) of this section and to the extent administratively feasible, by transfer to the annual leave ac-counts of leave donors who, on the date leave restoration is made, are em-ployed by a Federal agency and subject to chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code. (b) The amount of unused transferred annual leave to be restored to each leave donor shall be determined as fol-lows: (1) Divide the number of hours of un- used transferred annual leave by the total number of hours of annual leave transferred to the leave recipient; (2) Multiply the ratio obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the number of hours of annual leave trans- ferred by each leave donor eligible for restoration under paragraph (a) of this section; and (3) Round the result obtained in para- graph (b)(2) of this section to the near-est increment of time established by the leave donor’s employing agency to account for annual leave.

(d) Sick leave. An agency may make a temporary exception to retain on sick leave a lower standing employee cov-ered by chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code (or other applicable leave system for Federal employees), who is on approved sick leave on the effective date of the reduction in force, for a pe-riod not to exceed the date the employ-ee’s sick leave is exhausted. Use of sick leave for this purpose must be in ac-cordance with the requirements in part 630, subpart D, of this chapter (or other applicable leave system for Federal employees). Except as authorized by §351.606(b), an agency may not approve an employee’s use of any other type of leave after the employee has been re-tained under this paragraph (d). (e)(1) An agency may make a tem- porary exception to retain on accrued annual leave a lower standing em-ployee who: (i) Is being involuntarily separated under this part; (ii) Is covered by a Federal leave sys- tem under authority other than chap-ter 63 of title 5, United States Code; and, (iii) Will attain first eligibility for an immediate retirement benefit under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414 (or other au-thority), and/or establish eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 (or other authority) to carry health benefits coverage into retirement during the period rep-resented by the amount of the employ-ee’s accrued annual leave. (2) An agency may not approve an employee’s use of any other type of leave after the employee has been re-tained under this paragraph (e). (3) This exception may not exceed the date the employee first becomes eligi-ble for immediate retirement or for continuation of health benefits into re-tirement, except that an employee may be retained long enough to satisfy both retirement and health benefits require-ments. (4) Accrued annual leave includes all accumulated, accrued, and restored an-nual leave, as applicable, in addition to annual leave earned and available to the employee after the effective date of the reduction in force. When approving a temporary exception under this pro-vision, an agency may not advance an-nual leave or consider any annual leave that might be credited to an employ-ee’s account after the effective date of the reduction in force other than an-nual leave earned while in an annual leave status. (f) Other exceptions. An agency may make a temporary exception under this section to extend an employee’s separa-tion date beyond the effective date of the reduction in force when the tem-porary retention of a lower standing employee does not adversely affect the right of any higher standing employee who is released ahead of the lower standing employee. The agency may es-tablish a maximum number of days, up to 90 days, for which an exception may be approved. (g) Notice to employees. When an agen- cy approves an exception for more than 30 days, it must: (1) Notify in writing each higher standing employee in the same com-petitive level reached for release of the reasons for the exception and the date the lower standing employee’s reten-tion will end; and (2) List opposite the employee’s name on the retention register the reasons for the exception and the date the em-ployee’s retention will end.

(b) An employee whose position is transferred under this subpart solely for liquidation, and who is not identi-fied with an operating function specifi-cally authorized at the time of transfer to continue in operation more than 60 days, is not a competing employee for other positions in the competitive area gaining the function. (c) Regardless of an employee’s per- sonal preference, an employee has no right to transfer with his or her func-tion, unless the alternative in the com-petitive area losing the function is sep-aration or demotion.

(a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible for identifying the positions of competing employees with the transferring function. A com-peting employee is identified with the transferring function on the basis of the employee’s official position. Two methods are provided to identify em-ployees with the transferring function: (1) Identification Method One; and (2) Identification Method Two. (b) Identification Method One must be used to identify each position to which it is applicable. Identification Method Two is used only to identify positions to which Identification Meth-od One is not applicable. (c) Under Identification Method One, a competing employee is identified with a transferring function if— (1) The employee performs the func- tion during at least half of his or her work time; or (2) Regardless of the amount of time the employee performs the function during his or her work time, the func-tion performed by the employee in-cludes the duties controlling his or her grade or rate of pay. (3) In determining what percentage of time an employee performs a function in the employee’s official position, the agency may supplement the employee’s official position description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work re-ports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.). (d) Identification Method Two is ap- plicable to employees who perform the function during less than half of their work time and are not otherwise cov-ered by Identification Method One. Under Identification Method Two, the losing competitive area must identify the number of positions it needed to perform the transferring function. To determine which employees are identi-fied for transfer, the losing competitive area must establish a retention reg-ister in accordance with this part that includes the name of each competing employee who performed the function. Competing employees listed on the re-tention register are identified for transfer in the inverse order of their retention standing. If for any retention register this procedure would result in the separation or demotion by reduc-tion in force at the losing competitive area of any employee with higher re-tention standing, the losing competi-tive area must identify competing em-ployees on that register for transfer in the order of their retention standing. (e)(1) The competitive area losing the function may permit other employees to volunteer for transfer with the func-tion in place of employees identified under Identification Method One or Identification Method Two. However, the competitive area may permit these other employees to volunteer for trans-fer only if no competing employee who is identified for transfer under Identi-fication Method One or Identification Method Two is separated or demoted solely because a volunteer transferred in place of him or her to the competi-tive area that is gaining the function.

The question explores a complex and potentially stressful scenario that many federal employees might face during organizational restructuring.

The question's high utility stems from several key factors:
1. Relevance: It precisely targets RIF procedures, which are a core component of federal employment policy and workforce management.
2. Practicality: RIF situations are real challenges that federal employees and HR professionals must navigate, making this a highly actionable inquiry.
3. Complexity: The question demonstrates nuanced understanding by exploring the consequences of an employee's specific choice during a RIF scenario.
4. Stakeholder Impact: It is valuable for multiple stakeholders:
   - Federal employees facing potential job displacement
   - HR specialists managing RIF processes
   - Managers understanding workforce transition options
   - Employees considering career preservation strategies

The question requires detailed knowledge of Title 5 regulations regarding employee rights, transfer options, potential separation benefits, and procedural protections during organizational changes. Answering it would provide critical guidance for employees and managers in understanding their rights, obligations, and potential outcomes during workforce restructuring."

OPM, with OMB concurrence, may— (1) Grant full certification of an agency’s senior employee appraisal sys-tem(s) for 2 calendar years when an agency has demonstrated that it has designed and fully implemented and applied an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior profes-sionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in §430.404 and the documentation requirements of this section. (2) Grant provisional certification of an agency’s senior employee appraisal system(s) for 1 calendar year when an agency has designed, but not yet fully implemented or applied, an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in §430.404. OPM may extend provisional certification into the following cal-endar year in order to permit an agen-cy to take any actions needed to adjust pay based on annual summary ratings, ratings of record, or other performance appraisal results determined during the calendar year for which the system was certified; or (3) Suspend certification under para- graph (h) of this section if, at any time during the certification period, OPM, with OMB concurrence, determines that the agency appraisal system is not in compliance with certification cri-teria. (d) Pay limitations. Absent full or pro- visional certification of its appraisal system(s), an agency must— (1) Set a senior executive’s rate of basic pay at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective; and (2) Limit aggregate compensation paid to senior employees in a calendar year to the rate for level I of the Exec-utive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR 530.203(b). (e) Full certification. (1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant full cer-tification when a review of the agen-cy’s request and accompanying docu-mentation demonstrates that the de-sign, application, and administration of the agency’s appraisal system(s) meet the criteria in §430.404 and the documentation requirements of this section. (2) An agency with a fully-certified appraisal system(s) may set the rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, for a senior execu-tive covered by a certified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and pay senior employees covered by cer-tified system(s) aggregate compensa-tion in a certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President’s sal-ary under 3 U.S.C. 104. (3) Full certification of an agency’s appraisal system will be renewed auto-matically for an additional 2 calendar years, if— (i) The agency meets the annual re- porting requirements in paragraph (g) of this section; and (ii) Based on those annual reports, OPM determines, and OMB concurs, that the appraisal system(s) continues to meet the certification criteria and procedural requirements set forth in this subpart. (f) Provisional certification. (1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant pro-visional certification when the design of an agency’s appraisal system(s) for senior executives or senior profes-sionals, as applicable, meets the re-quirements set forth in this subpart, but insufficient documentation exists to determine whether the actual appli-cation and administration of the ap-praisal system(s) meet the require-ments for full certification. OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant provi-sional certification to an agency more than once. (2) During the 1-year period of provi- sional certification, an agency may set the rate of basic pay for a senior execu-tive covered by the provisionally cer-tified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Exec- utive Schedule (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and pay senior employees covered by provi-sionally certified systems aggregate compensation in the certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President’s salary under 3 U.S.C. 104 (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, sub-part B).

An agency with a provisionally certified appraisal sys-tem(s) may request that OPM, with OMB concurrence, grant full certifi-cation upon a showing that its per-formance appraisal systems for senior executives and senior professionals, as applicable, meet the certification cri-teria in §430.404 and the documentation requirements in this section, particu-larly with respect to the implementa-tion and administration of the sys-tem(s) over at least two consecutive performance appraisal periods. (g) Annual reporting requirement. Agencies with certified appraisal sys-tems must provide OPM with a general summary of the annual summary rat-ings and ratings of record, as applica-ble, and rates of basic pay, pay adjust-ments, cash awards, and aggregate total compensation (including any lump-sum payments in excess of the applicable aggregate limitation on pay that were paid in the current calendar year as required by §530.204) for their senior employees covered by a certified appraisal system at the conclusion of each appraisal period that ends during a calendar year for which the certifi-cation is in effect, in accordance with OPM instructions. (h) Suspension of certification. (1) When OPM determines that an agen-cy’s certified appraisal system is no longer in compliance with certification criteria, OPM, with OMB concurrence, may suspend such certification, as pro-vided in paragraph (c)(3) of this sec-tion. (2) An agency’s system certification is automatically suspended when OPM withdraws performance appraisal sys-tem approval or mandates corrective action because of misapplication of the system as authorized under §§430.210(c), 430.312(c), and 430.403(e). (3) OPM will notify the head of the agency at least 30 calendar days in ad-vance of the suspension and the rea-son(s) for the suspension, as well as any expected corrective action. Upon such notice, and until its system cer-tification is reinstated, the agency must set a senior executive’s rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, at a rate that does not exceed the', 'for the purpose of determining whether an employee maintains residency in that geographic area for the duration of the service agreement. (e) The service agreement must in- clude the conditions under which the agency may terminate the service agreement before the employee com-pletes the agreed-upon service period. The service agreement must specify the effect of the termination under §575.211, including the conditions under which the agency will pay an addi-tional relocation incentive payment for partially completed service under §575.211(e) and (f).

For example, the service agreement may specify the employee’s work schedule, type of position, and the duties he or she is expected to perform. In addition, the service agreement may address the extent to which periods of time on de-tail, in a nonpay status, or in a paid leave status are creditable towards the completion of the service period.

(a) An authorized agency official may unilaterally terminate a relocation in-centive service agreement based solely on the management needs of the agen-cy. For example, an agency may termi-nate a service agreement when the em-ployee’s position is affected by a reduc-tion in force, when there are insuffi-cient funds to continue the planned in-centive payments, or when the agency assigns the employee to a different po-sition (if the different position is not within the terms of the service agree-ment). (b) An authorized agency official must terminate a relocation incentive service agreement if an employee is de-moted or separated for cause ( i.e., for unacceptable performance or conduct), if the employee receives a rating of record (or an official performance ap-praisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 CFR part 430) of less than ‘‘Fully Suc-cessful’’ or equivalent, if the employee fails to maintain residency in the new geographic area for the duration of the service agreement, or if the employee otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement. (c) The termination of a service agreement is not grievable or appeal-able. (d) The agency must notify an em- ployee in writing when it terminates a relocation incentive service agreement. (e) If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement under paragraph (a) of this section, the em-ployee is entitled to all relocation in-centive payments attributable to com- pleted service and to retain any por-tion of a relocation incentive payment he or she received that is attributable to uncompleted service. (f) If an authorized agency official terminates a service agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, the em-ployee is entitled to retain relocation incentive payments previously paid by the agency that are attributable to the completed portion of the service pe-riod. If the employee received reloca-tion incentive payments that are less than the amount that would be attrib-utable to the completed portion of the service period, the agency is not obli-gated to pay the employee the amount attributable to completed service, un-less the agency agreed to such payment under the terms of the relocation in-centive service agreement. If the em-ployee received relocation incentive payments in excess of the amount that would be attributable to the completed portion of the service period, he or she must repay the excess amount, except when an authorized agency official waives the requirement to repay the excess amount under paragraph (h) of this section. (g) If an employee fails to reimburse the paying agency for the full amount owed under paragraph (f) of this sec-tion, the amount outstanding must be recovered from the employee under the agency’s regulations for collection by offset from an indebted Government employee under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, or through the ap-propriate provisions governing Federal debt collection if the individual is no longer a Federal employee. (h) If an employee received reloca- tion incentive payments in excess of the amount that would be attributable to the completed portion of the service period under paragraph (f) of this sec-tion, an authorized agency official may waive the requirement to repay the ex-cess amount when, in the judgment of the official, collection of the excess amount would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best in-terest of the United States.

(a) Each agency must monitor the use of relocation incentives to ensure that the agency’s relocation incentive plan and the payment of relocation in-centives are consistent with the re-quirements and criteria established under 5 U.S.C. 5753 and this subpart. (b) When OPM finds that an agency is not paying relocation incentives con-sistent with the agency’s relocation in-centive plan and the criteria estab-lished under this subpart or otherwise determines that the agency is not using this authority selectively and ju-diciously, OPM may— (1) Direct the agency to revoke or suspend the authority granted to any organizational component in the agen- cy and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the component obtain approval from the agency’s headquarters level before paying a relocation incentive to such employees; or (2) Revoke or suspend the authority granted to the agency under this sub-part for all or any part of the agency and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the agency obtain OPM’s approval be-fore paying a relocation incentive to such employees. § 575.213 Records and reports. Each agency must keep a record of each determination to pay a relocation incentive and make such records avail-able for review upon OPM’s request.

Agencies must evaluate eligible college graduates using the OPM-prescribed qualification standard, or an OPM-approved agency- specific minimum qualification stand-ard, for the position being filled. (d) Classification. An agency may make an initial appointment of an eli-gible and qualified individual to any position classified according to OPM classification standards in a profes-sional or administrative occupational series at the GS–11 level (or equivalent) or below, including positions with pro-motion potential beyond the GS–11. (e) Public notice and advertising. An agency must adhere to merit system principles, and thus must publicly ad-vertise the position in a manner that endeavors to reach qualified individ-uals from all segments of society, in-cluding notifying OPM, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3327(b), before filling a po-sition under this authority. To meet this requirement, an agency must dis-play information about the position to be filled on its home page (that is ac-cessible to the general public). An agency may, but is not required to, use www.USAJOBS.gov for this purpose. Al- ternatively, an agency may either pro-vide an actual job announcement on its public-facing web page (home page) or provide a link to the job announcement on its public-facing homepage. The agency should consider whether addi-tional recruitment and advertisement activities are necessary or appropriate to further merit system principles. If USAJOBS is not used to advertise the position, the agency must satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 3327(b) by pro-viding OPM information about the po-sition in the same format it usually would when posting a position on USAJOBS. A job announcement must include, at a minimum, the following information: (1) The position title, series, grade level; (2) The geographic location where the position will be filled; (3) The starting salary of the posi- tion; (4) The minimum qualifications of the position; (5) Whether the position has pro- motion protentional to higher grade levels; (6) Any other relevant information about the position such as telework op-portunities, recruitment incentives, etc.; (7) Specific information instructing applicants on how to apply; (8) Equal employment opportunity statement (Agencies may use the rec-ommended equal employment oppor-tunity statement located on OPM’s USAJOBS website.); and (9) Reasonable accommodation state- ment.

A person appointed under this section ac-quires competitive status upon comple-tion of probationary period in accord-ance with the provisions of subpart H of this part. (h) Tenure upon appointment. A person appointed under paragraph (a) of this section becomes a career-conditional employee unless the appointee has al-ready satisfied the requirements for ca-reer tenure or is exempt from the serv-ice requirement pursuant to §315.201. (i) Numerical limit on the number of ap- pointments.

(c) Based on additional housing data that may be collected before the 2005 survey conducted in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, OPM will ad-just as warranted the price indexes and COLA rates for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the COLA areas in the State of Alaska. OPM will imple-ment any such adjustments on a one- time basis on the effective date of the results of the 2004 surveys conducted in Hawaii and Guam/CNMI, and subject to §591.228. OPM will publish such adjust-ments as provided in §591.229. [67 FR 22340, May 3, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 59763, Oct. 6, 2004] § 591.225 Which CPIs does OPM use? OPM uses the following CPIs: (a) For the Washington, DC, area— the BLS Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers (CPI-U); (b) For all COLA areas in the State of Alaska—the BLS CPI-U for Anchorage, AK; (c) For all COLA areas in the State of Hawaii and for Guam and the CNMI— the BLS CPI-U for Honolulu, HI; and (d) For Puerto Rico and the U.S. Vir- gin Islands—the Puerto Rico CPI as produced by the Puerto Rico Depart-ment of Work and Human Resources. § 591.226 How does OPM apply the CPIs? (a) OPM uses a three-step process to adjust price indexes by relative annual or biennial changes in the CPIs. For steps 1 and 2, OPM computes the an-nual change by dividing the CPI from 1 year after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey. OPM computes the biennial change by dividing the CPI from 2 years after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey. (1) Step 1. OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the COLA area. (2) Step 2. OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the DC area. (3) Step 3. OPM multiplies the COLA area price index from the last survey by the COLA area CPI change com-puted in step 1 divided by the DC area CPI change computed in step 2. The ad-justed price index is rounded to the second decimal place.

OPM adds to the price index an ad- justment factor that reflects dif-ferences in need, access to and avail-ability of goods and services, and qual-ity of life in the COLA area relative to the DC area. The following table shows the adjustment factor for each area: COLA area Amount Anchorage, AK ........................................................ 7.0 Fairbanks, AK .......................................................... 9.0 Juneau, AK .............................................................. 9.0 Rest of the State of Alaska ..................................... 9.0 City and County of Honolulu, HI ............................. 5.0 Hawaii County, HI .................................................... 7.0 Kauai County, HI ..................................................... 7.0 Maui County, HI ....................................................... 7.0 Guam and CNMI ..................................................... 9.0 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ............................... 7.0 U.S. Virgin Islands ................................................... 9.0 1Amount added to the price index. § 591.228 How does OPM convert the price index plus adjustment factor to a COLA rate? (a) OPM converts the price index plus the adjustment factor to a COLA rate as shown in the following table: Price index plus adjustment factor COLA rate subject to para- graph (b) of this section Equal to or greater than 124.50.25 percent. Equal to or greater than 102.00 but less than 124.50.Price index plus the adjust- ment factor, minus 100, ex-pressed to the nearest whole percent. Less than 102.00 ................... 0 percent. (b) This section is applicable on an area-by-area basis beginning with the effective date of the results of the first survey conducted in each area. (c) OPM may reduce the COLA rate in any area by no more than 1 percent-age point in any 12-month period. Any reduction in the COLA rate for any COLA area cannot be effective until the effective date of the first survey conducted in Hawaii and Guam and CNMI under these regulations. § 591.229 How does OPM inform agen- cies and employees of COLA rate changes? OPM publishes COLA area survey summary reports, MEG and PEG in-dexes, and COLA rates in the F EDERAL REGISTER . OPM makes survey data and other information available to the pub-lic to the extent authorized by the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. P OSTDIFFERENTIALS § 591.230 When does OPM establish post differential areas? (a) OPM establishes post differential areas in response to agency requests when— (1) Conditions of environment within the post differential area differ sub-stantially from conditions of environ-ment in the continental United States, and (2) The major Federal employers within the area believe payment of a post differential is warranted as a re-cruitment incentive to attract can-didates from outside the post differen-tial area to work for the Government in the post differential area. (b) If a department or agency wants OPM to consider establishing or revis-ing the definition of a post differential area, the head of the department or agency or his or her designee must sub-mit a request in writing to OPM. § 591.231 Which areas are post dif- ferential areas? OPM has established the following post differential areas: (a) American Samoa as defined in §591.205, (b) Territory of Guam, (c) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, (d) Johnston Atoll (including Sand Island), (e) Midway Atoll, and (f) Wake Atoll. § 591.232 How does OPM establish and review post differentials?

The query demonstrates a nuanced understanding of performance appraisal certification processes, which is crucial for HR specialists, managers, and federal employees involved in performance evaluation and organizational compliance.

The question's practicality is strong because:
1. It seeks to clarify a technical but important distinction in performance management systems
2. Understanding certification types can impact how performance evaluations are conducted and interpreted
3. It relates directly to agency accountability and employee performance assessment standards

The information need is substantive, targeting a specific technical aspect of federal performance management that requires detailed regulatory knowledge. This type of question would be particularly valuable for:
- HR professionals responsible for implementing performance appraisal systems
- Managers seeking to understand the legal and procedural framework of performance evaluations
- Agency leaders interested in ensuring their performance management meets federal standards

While not a basic or universally applicable question, it represents a sophisticated inquiry into the technical details of federal performance management regulations, making it a valuable resource for those deeply engaged with Title 5 performance management guidelines."
" What factors must an agency consider when setting pay for a new appointment above the minimum grade rate?
"," Per § 532.403(b), when making a new appointment at a rate above the minimum grade rate, an agency must:
- Consider how similar positions have set steps for employees with comparable qualifications
- NOT consider the appointee's pay history or competing job offer pay rates
- Consider relevant factors such as:
  1. The level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills/competencies
  2. Significant salary disparities between Federal and non-Federal salaries for required skills
The goal is to set an appropriate step rate based on the appointee's specific qualifications and job requirements.","['CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 551.709 § 551.709 Availability of information.

This part applies to employment of civilian annuitants who would be sub-ject to termination of annuity or annu-ity offset under 5 U.S.C. 8344 or 5 U.S.C. 8468. Agencies may request exceptions as provided in subpart B of this part from the reemployed annuitant provi-sions of 5 U.S.C. 8344 (for Civil Service Retirement System annuitants) or 8468 (for Federal Employees’ Retirement System annuitants), as appropriate. [65 FR 19644, Apr. 12, 2000] § 553.102 Definitions. (a) Agency, as used in this part, means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. (b) Annuitant, as used in this part, re- fers to a current or former civilian em-ployee who is receiving, or meets the legal requirements and is applying or has announced intention to apply for, an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, based on his or her service.

A determination made in connection with one position does not require a like determination in connec-tion with any other position. In decid-ing whether to request an exception or grant an exception under delegated au-thority, each agency is expected to weigh fiscal responsibility and em-ployee equity and should consider such factors as availability of funds as well as the criteria set out in this part. (b) Application of exceptions. An excep- tion to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344 or 8468 authorized by OPM or an agency under this part applies only to the particular individual for whom it was authorized and only while that individual continues to serve in the same or a successor position. The exception terminates upon the individ-ual’s assignment to a different position unless a new exception is authorized under the provisions of this part. [56 FR 6206, Feb. 14, 1991, as amended at 65 FR 19644, Apr. 12, 2000] Subpart B—Special Provisions for Reemployment Without Pen-alty To Meet Exceptional Re-cruiting or Retention Needs § 553.201 Requesting OPM approval for reemployment without reduc-tion or termination of annuity in in-dividual cases. (a) Request by agency head. The head of an agency may request OPM to ap-prove individual exceptions on a case- by-case basis to meet temporary hiring needs based on an emergency or other unusual circumstances or when the agency has encountered exceptional difficulty in recruiting or retaining a qualified candidate for a particular po-sition. Authority to submit such a re-quest may not be redelegated to an of-ficial below the agency’s headquarters level. (b) Requirements for all requests. (1) Each request must identify the indi-vidual for whom the exception is re-quested, the appointing authority to be used, and the position to which he or she will be appointed. (2) The request must be submitted in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section. (3) Unless the request is submitted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the individual must be off the agency’s rolls before submission. (c) Requests based on an emergency hir- ing need. An agency may request reem- ployment without penalty for an indi-vidual whose services are needed on a temporary basis to respond to an emer-gency involving a direct threat to life or property. Requests submitted on that basis must meet the following cri-teria: (1) Nature of emergency. Describe the military threat, natural disaster, or other unforeseen occurrence, the date it occurred, and the expected duration of the emergency response effort. (2) Need for the individual’s services. The agency must show either that the individual is uniquely qualified for the emergency response work to be done or that the number of positions to be filled and/or urgency of response justi-fies making the particular appoint-ment without further delay.

An em-ployee who performs work requiring advanced knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, inter-pret or make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school level; (2) The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning which includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00711 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR702 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 551.208 sciences, pharmacy, and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status as distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science or learn-ing; and (3) The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual in-struction which restricts the exemp-tion to professions where specialized academic training is a standard pre-requisite for entrance into the profes-sion. The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this require-ment is possession of the appropriate academic degree. However, the word ‘‘customarily’’ means that the exemp-tion is appropriate for employees in such professions who have substan-tially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who at-tained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experi-ence and intellectual instruction. For example, the learned professional ex-emption is appropriate in unusual cases where a lawyer has not gone to law school, or a chemist does not pos-sess a degree in chemistry. However, the learned professional exemption is not applicable to occupations that cus-tomarily may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired through an appren-ticeship, or with training in the per-formance of routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical processes. The learned professional exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than by ad-vanced specialized intellectual instruc-tion. The position of Engineering Tech-nician is an example of such an occupa-tion where the employee collects, ob-serves, tests and records factual sci-entific data within the oversight of professional engineers, and performs work using knowledge acquired through on-the-job and classroom training rather than by acquiring the knowledge through prolonged academic study. (b) Expansion of professional exemp- tion. The areas in which the profes- sional exemption may be applicable are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic training is broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced specialized degree has become a stand-ard requirement for a particular occu-pation, that occupation may have ac-quired the characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and certifying organizations similar to those listed in this section also may be created in the future. Such organizations may de-velop similar, specialized curriculums and certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may indicate that the oc-cupation has acquired the characteris-tics of a learned profession. (c) Practice of law. (1) This exemption applies to an employee in a profes-sional legal position requiring admis-sion to the bar and involved in pre-paring cases for trial and/or the trial of cases before a court or an administra-tive body or persons having quasi-judi-cial power; rendering legal advice and services; preparing interpretive and ad-ministrative orders, rules, or regula-tions; drafting, negotiating, or exam-ining contracts or other legal docu-ments; drafting, preparing formal com-ments, or otherwise making sub-stantive recommendations with respect to proposed legislation; editing and preparing for publication statutes en-acted by Congress and opinions or deci-sions of a court, commission, or board; and drafting and reviewing decisions for consideration and adoption by agency officials. (2) Section 551.203 (Salary-based non- exemption) does not apply to the em-ployees described in this section. (d) Practice of medicine. (1) An em- ployee who holds a valid license or cer-tificate permitting the practice of med-icine or any of its branches and is actu-ally engaged in the practice of the pro-fession is exempt. The exemption ap-plies to physicians and other practi-tioners licensed and practicing in the field of medical science and healing or any of the medical specialties prac-ticed by physicians or practitioners.

(2) An employee who holds the re- quired academic degree for the general practice of medicine and is engaged in an internship or resident program pur-suant to the practice of the profession is exempt. Employees engaged in in-ternship or resident programs, whether or not licensed to practice prior to commencement of the program, qualify as exempt professionals if they enter such internship or resident programs after the earning of the appropriate de-gree required for the general practice of their profession. (3) Section 551.203 (Salary-based non- exemption) does not apply to the em-ployees described in this section. (e) Accounting. Certified public ac- countants generally meet the duties re-quirements for the learned professional exemption. An employee performing similar professional work in a position with a positive educational require-ment and requiring the application of accounting theories, concepts, prin-ciples, and standards may qualify as an exempt learned professional. However, accounting clerks and technicians and other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as exempt profes-sionals. (f) Engineering. Engineers generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. Profes-sional engineering work typically in-volves the application of a knowledge of such engineering fundamentals as the strength and strain analysis of en-gineering materials and structures, the physical and chemical characteristics of engineering materials such as elas-tic limits, maximum unit stresses, co-efficients of expansion, workability, hardness, tendency to fatigue, resist-ance to corrosion, engineering adapt-ability, and engineering methods of construction and processing. Exempt professional engineering work includes equivalent work performed in any of the specialized branches of engineering (e.g., electrical, mechanical, or mate- rials engineering).

Rate of basic pay means the scheduled rate of pay plus any night or environ-mental differential. Reassignment means a change of an employee, while serving continuously in the same agency, from one job to an-other without promotion or change to a lower grade. Representative rate means the going rate, i.e., the rate or step keyed to the prevailing rate determination. For ex-ample: (1) The established rate on a single rate schedule; (2) The second rate on a five-rate reg- ular wage schedule; (3) The fourth rate on the General Schedule; or (4) The fourth rate of a class under the Foreign Service Officer and For-eign Service Staff schedule. Retained rate means the rate of pay an employee is receiving which is high-er than the maximum scheduled rate of pay of the Federal Wage System grade or pay level to which the employee is assigned. Scheduled rate of pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action, including a retained rate of pay, for the job held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a new ap-pointment to a position shall be made at the minimum rate of the appro-priate grade. (b) An agency may make a new ap- pointment at a rate above the min-imum rate of the appropriate grade in recognition of an appointees’ special qualifications. In determining the rate at which to set the appointee’s pay: (1) An agency must consider how the step has been set for employees who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the ap-pointee’s skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences) and who have been newly appointed to posi-tions that are similar to the ap-pointee’s position (based on the posi-tion’s occupational series, grade level, organization, geographic location, or other job-relevant factors), if applica-ble; (2) An agency may not consider the appointee’s pay history ( i.e., existing pay or prior pay) or a pay rate from a competing job offer; and (3) An agency must consider other relevant factors (e.g., the level, type, or quality of the appointee’s skills or competencies; or significant disparities between Federal and non-Federal sala-ries for the skills and competencies re-quired in the position to be filled).

(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of §532.407 of this subpart and part 536 of this chapter, when an employee is re-employed, reassigned, transferred, pro-moted, or changed to a lower grade, the agency may fix the pay at any rate of the new grade which does not exceed the employee’s highest previous rate. (2) However, if the employee’s high- est previous rate falls between two step-rates of the new grade, the agency may fix the pay at the higher of the two. (b)(1) When an employee’s type of ap- pointment is changed in the same job, an agency may continue to pay the ex-isting scheduled rate or may pay any higher rate of the grade which does not exceed the employee’s highest previous rate. (2) However, if the highest previous rate falls between two step rates of the grade, the agency may pay the higher rate. (c)(1) The highest previous rate, if earned in a wage job, is the current rate of the grade and step-rate of the former job on the same type of wage schedule in the wage area in which the employee is being employed, or the ac-tual earned rate, whichever is higher. (2) If earned on a General Schedule or another pay system other than the Federal Wage System, it is the current rate for the same grade and rate of that schedule. (d) The highest previous rate may be based upon a rate of pay received dur-ing a temporary promotion, so long as the temporary promotion is for a pe-riod of not less than 1 year. This limi-tation does not apply upon permanent placement in a position at the same or higher grade. (e) Before setting pay under this sec- tion, an agency must establish a policy regarding use of employees’ highest previous rates. The policy must include the following elements: (1) Designation of officials with the authority to approve and set pay under this section; (2) Any situations in which the agen- cy must use an employee’s highest pre-vious rate; (3) Any situations in which the agen- cy may exercise its discretion in using an employee’s highest previous rate; (4) Consideration of the step at which pay has been set for other employees performing similar work in the organi-zation (based on the position’s occupa-tional series, grade level, types of du-ties, or other job-relevant factors) and any other factors the designated offi-cial(s) may or must consider in deter-mining the step at which to set the em-ployee’s pay between the employee’s entitlement under any other applicable pay-setting rule and the employee’s highest previous rate; and (5) Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow recon-struction of the action.

The question addresses a critical aspect of federal pay administration that is relevant to multiple stakeholders:

1. For HR Specialists: It provides insight into the complex process of setting initial pay rates for new federal employees, which requires careful consideration of multiple regulatory factors.

2. For Managers: Understanding pay-setting guidelines is crucial for recruitment, budgeting, and ensuring fair compensation practices.

3. For Job Candidates: The question helps potential federal employees understand how their initial salary might be determined beyond a simple minimum rate.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal pay system nuances, specifically addressing the discretionary aspects of pay-setting above the minimum grade rate. It implies there are specific regulatory considerations beyond a simple base rate, which suggests a need for detailed knowledge of Title 5 compensation rules.

This type of question is particularly valuable because it goes beyond surface-level information and seeks to understand the substantive criteria and decision-making process for federal pay determination. It would be useful for anyone involved in federal employment, from HR professionals to potential employees seeking to understand compensation mechanisms."
 Under what circumstances can an employee be granted sick leave for family care purposes?," According to §630.401, an employee can be granted sick leave to provide care for a family member in three specific scenarios:
1. When a family member is incapacitated by a medical or mental condition or is receiving medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment
2. When a family member has a serious health condition
3.

(3) The agency head (or designee) must inform both the affected employ-ees and the agency payroll provider in writing of the termination date as de-termined in paragraph (f)(2) of this sec-tion. (g) When the agency head (or des- ignee) fixes a termination date of the exigency of the public business under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each af-fected employee must make a reason-able effort to comply with the sched-uling requirement in §630.308(a). The head of the agency (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt such an employee or group of employees from the advanced sched-uling requirement in §630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sec-tion terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) de-termines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or designee) must no-tify any employee exempted from the scheduling requirement in writing. (h)(1) Upon termination of an exi- gency established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section based on the end-ing of the exigency under paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iv) of this section, an agency head (or designee) may deter-mine that certain agency employees continue to be subject to an ongoing exigency of the public business. An on-going exigency of the public business is an exigency that commences imme-diately after the termination of a na-tional emergency exigency and is di-rectly related to the matter that was previously determined to be a national emergency exigency. In order for an employee to be covered under an ongo-ing exigency, the employee must first be covered by a national emergency ex-igency and then be covered by the on-going exigency without a break in time. (2) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an on-going exigency, the employee will not be subject to time limits on usage of any restored leave to the employee’s credit under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), including a time limit established under para-graph (d) of this section that is deter-mined based on the termination of the national emergency exigency. When the ongoing exigency ends, all restored annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) to the employee’s credit must be consoli-dated at that time and made subject to a single time limit that is determined under the rules in paragraph (d) of this section, using the termination date of the ongoing exigency in place of the termination date of the national emer-gency exigency. (3) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an on-going exigency, the employee will not be subject to the advance scheduling requirements in §630.308(a). An agency head (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt an employee or group of employees from the advanced scheduling require-ment in §630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under the on-going exigency terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) determines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or des-ignee) must notify any employee ex-empted from the scheduling require-ment in writing. (4) Employee coverage under such an ongoing exigency may not be continued for more than 12 months unless the agency head (or designee) requests, and the Director of OPM approves, one or more time-limited waivers based on a critical agency need for the services of the employee or group of employees.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 430.404 systems must submit systems that have been approved by OPM under §430.312 or §430.210, as applicable. In some agencies, the performance ap-praisal system(s) covers employees in many organizations and/or compo-nents, and their ability to meet the certification criteria in §430.404 may vary significantly. In such cases, an agency may establish and/or submit separate performance appraisal sys-tems for each of these distinct organi-zations and/or components to ensure timely certification of those perform-ance appraisal system(s) that meet the criteria. New appraisal systems estab-lished under 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable based on the em-ployees covered, must be approved by OPM. (c) When an agency establishes a new appraisal system for the purpose of seeking certification under this sub-part, the agency may submit that sys-tem for certification even if it has not yet been approved by OPM under §430.312 or §430.210, as applicable. OPM will certify, with OMB concurrence, only those systems that OPM deter-mines meet the approval requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as ap-plicable. (d) An agency must establish an ap- praisal system(s), as defined in §430.402, for its senior professionals that meets the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, and is separate from the system(s) established to cover its SES members under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C. For the purpose of certification under this subpart, such senior profes-sional appraisal system(s) must meet the certification criteria set forth in §430.404. At its discretion, an agency may include system features in its sen-ior professional appraisal system(s) that are the same as, or similar to, the features of its SES appraisal system(s), as appropriate, including procedures that correspond to the higher level re-view procedures under §430.308(b) and PRB reviews of summary ratings under §430.308(c). (e) For agencies subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430, OPM ap-proval of the agency performance ap-praisal system(s) is a prerequisite to certification. Agencies not subject to the appraisal provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430 and which are seeking certification of their appraisal system(s) under this subpart must submit appropriate documenta-tion to demonstrate that each system complies with the appropriate legal au-thority that governs the establish-ment, application, and administration of that system. § 430.404 Certification criteria. (a) To be certified, an agency’s appli- cable appraisal system(s) for senior ex-ecutives or senior professionals must make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance and meet the other requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, as applicable, in addition to the par-ticular criterion cited here ( i.e., con- sultation). Such system(s) must pro-vide for the following: (1) Alignment, so that the perform- ance expectations for individual senior employees derive from, and clearly link to, the agency’s mission, GPRA strategic goals, program and policy ob-jectives, and/or annual performance plans and budget priorities; (2) Consultation, so that the perform- ance expectations for senior employees meet the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, as applicable, and/or other applicable legal authority; are developed with the input and in-volvement of the individual senior em-ployees who are covered thereby; and are communicated to them at the be-ginning of the applicable appraisal pe- riod, and/or at appropriate times there-after; (3) Results, so that the performance expectations for individual senior em-ployees apply to their respective areas of responsibility; reflect expected agen-cy and/or organizational outcomes and outputs, performance targets or metrics, policy/program objectives, and/or milestones; identify specific pro-grammatic crosscutting, external, and partnership-oriented goals or objec-tives, as applicable; and are stated in terms of observable, measurable, and/or demonstrable performance; (4) Balance, so that in addition to ex- pected results, the performance expec-tations for individual senior employees include appropriate measures or indi-cators of employee and/or customer/ VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00380 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR371 Office of Personnel Management § 430.404 stakeholder feedback; quality, quan- tity, timeliness, and cost effectiveness, as applicable; and those technical, leadership and/or managerial com-petencies or behaviors that contribute to and are necessary to distinguish outstanding performance; (5) Appropriate assessments of the agency’s performance—overall and with respect to each of its particular missions, components, programs, pol-icy areas, and support functions—such as reports of the agency’s GPRA goals, annual performance plans and targets, program performance measures, and other appropriate indicators, as well as evaluation guidelines based, in part, upon those assessments, that are com-municated by the agency head, or an individual specifically designated by the agency head for such purpose, to senior employees, appropriate senior employee rating and reviewing offi-cials, and PRB members.

[33 FR 12433, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 51 FR 25187, July 11, 1986] § 352.205 Appeal of losing agency. An appointing officer who intends to employ with reemployment rights an employee of another executive agency shall give the losing agency written no-tice at least 15 calendar days before the effective date of the proposed action. If the losing agency believes the grant of reemployment rights would be detri-mental to the public interest, it may appeal the proposed grant to OPM within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice. The losing agency, at the same time, shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the prospective appointing officer, who shall withhold the pro-posed grant pending decision on the ap-peal. OPM shall determine whether the employee will be given reemployment rights and notify both agencies accord-ingly. If the losing agency does not ap-peal within 15 calendar days, the em-ployee shall be granted reemployment rights. § 352.205a Authority to return em- ployee to his or her former or suc-cessor agency. The transfer of an employee with a grant of reemployment rights under this subpart authorizes the return of the employee to his or her former or successor agency without regard to part 351, 752, or 771 of this chapter when the employee is reemployed in his or her former or successor agency— (a) Without a break in service of 1 workday or more in a position at the same or higher grade in the same occu-pational field and geographical area as the position he or she last held in the former or successor agency; and (b) At not less than the rate of pay he or she would have been receiving in the position last held in the former or suc-cessor agency if he or she had not been transferred.

(b) Termination. An employee’s reem- ployment rights terminate if: (1) He fails to apply within the time limits stated in paragraph (a) of this section; (2) He resigns without the written consent of the current employing agen-cy; or (3) Within 10 calendar days, he fails to accept an offer of reemployment made under §352.208 which is deter-mined to be a proper offer of reemploy-ment by the reemploying agency or by the Merit Systems Protection Board on appeal. § 352.208 Agency’s obligation to reem- ploy. (a) Employee’s right to reemployment. An employee is entitled to be reem-ployed by the reemploying agency as promptly as possible but not more than 30 calendar days after receipt of his ap-plication. Except as provided in para-graph (c) of this section, the employee is entitled to reemployment in the oc-cupational field and at the same grade or level and in the same geographical area as the position which the em-ployee last held in that agency. If the reemployment would cause the separa-tion or demotion of another employee, the applicant shall then be considered an employee for the purpose of apply-ing the reduction-in-force regulations (5 CFR part 351) to determine to what, if any, position, he or she is entitled. (b) Reemployment in a higher grade. The reemploying agency may reemploy the employee in a position of higher grade than that to which he is entitled, but not if this reemployment would cause the displacement of another em-ployee. (c) Reemployment in SES. When the employee’s right is to a position in the SES, reemployment or return may be to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified. (d) Seniority in postal service. On reem- ployment in the postal service, the em-ployee is entitled to the seniority he would have attained had he remained in the postal service. (e) Basis for agency refusal to reemploy. An agency may refuse to reemploy under this section only when the em-ployee was last separated for serious cause evidencing his unsuitability for reemployment.

A claim accrues when loss or damage is or should have been discovered by claimant even though such loss or damage occurred at a prior time. § 180.104 Allowable claims. (a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the neg-ligent or wrongful act of the claimant, claimant’s agent, a member of claim-ant’s family, or claimant’s private em-ployee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the cir-cumstances); (2) The possession of the property damaged or lost and the quantity pos-sessed is determined to have been rea-sonable, useful, or proper under the cir-cumstances; and (3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence. (b) Claims which are otherwise allow- able under this part shall not be dis-allowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claim-ant at the time of the damage or loss or solely because the claimant was not legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, bor-rowed property may be the subject of a claim. (c) Subject to the conditions in §180.104(a) and the other provisions of this part, any claim for damage to or loss of personal property incident to service with OPM may be considered and allowed.

(3) Motor vehicles. Claims may be al- lowed for automobiles and other motor vehicles damaged or lost in oversea shipments provided by the Govern-ment. ‘‘Shipments provided by the Government’’ means via Government vessels, charter of commercial vessels, or by Government bills of lading on commercial vessels, and includes stor-age, unloading, and off-loading inci-dent thereto. Other claims for damage to or loss of automobiles and other motor vehicles may be allowed only when use of the vehicle on a non-reim-bursable basis was required by the claimant’s supervisor. (4) Mobile homes. Claims may be al- lowed for damage to or loss of mobile homes and their contents under the provisions of §180.104(c)(2). Claims for structural damage to mobile homes, other than that caused by collision, and damage to contents of mobile homes resulting from such structural damage must contain conclusive evi-dence that the damage was not caused by structural deficiency of the mobile home and that it was not overloaded. Claims for damage to or loss of tires mounted on mobile homes may be al-lowed only in cases of collision, theft, or vandalism. (5) Money. Claims for money in an amount that is determined to be rea-sonable for the claimant to possess at the time of the loss are payable: (i) Where personal funds were accept- ed by responsible Government per-sonnel with apparent authority to re-ceive them for safekeeping deposit, transmittal, or other authorized dis-position, but were neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned; (ii) When lost incident to a marine or aircraft disaster; (iii) When lost by fire, flood, hurri- cane, or other natural disaster; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR44 5 CFR Ch.

Family care sick leave is an important policy that impacts many federal workers who need to care for ill family members or handle family medical emergencies. The question is relevant to:

1. Employees seeking to understand their leave rights
2. HR specialists who must process and approve sick leave requests
3. Managers responsible for managing employee leave and understanding policy constraints
4. Individuals balancing work and family care responsibilities

The question touches on a nuanced area of federal employment policy that has significant real-world implications. It requires understanding the specific circumstances under which sick leave can be used for family care, which is not always straightforward. This includes potential scenarios like caring for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, attending medical appointments, or providing necessary care during illness.

The query demonstrates a genuine information need that could help federal employees make informed decisions about their leave usage, ensure compliance with regulations, and understand their rights. It's a practical, substantive question that goes beyond surface-level policy and seeks to clarify the specific conditions and limitations of family care sick leave."

(a) Each agency with positions sub- ject to this subpart must establish written procedures for setting the rate of basic pay and increasing the rate of basic pay of incumbents of the posi-tions in accordance with law and this subpart. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for mak-ing pay decisions, while assuring con-fidentiality. The agency’s plan for set-ting and increasing rates of basic pay must reflect meaningful distinctions among SL and ST employees based on individual performance, contribution to agency performance, or both, and must include— (1) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional’s rate of basic pay to ensure that indi-vidual pay rates or pay increases, as well as their overall distribution with-in the senior professional pay range, reflect meaningful distinctions within a single performance level (e.g., the higher the employee’s relative per-formance within a rating level, the higher the pay increase), between per-formance rating levels (e.g., the higher the rating level, the higher the pay in-crease), or both; (2) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional’s rate of basic pay at a rate that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if the applicable agency per-formance appraisal system has been certified under part 430, subpart D of this chapter; (3) Any system, methods, or criteria the agency uses to establish pay ranges applicable to various SL or ST posi-tions within the pay range that applies under §534.504(a), consistent with the requirement that pay be determined based upon individual performance, contributions to the agency’s perform-ance, or both; (4) The designation of the authorized agency official(s) who will have the au-thority to set and adjust rates of basic pay for SL and ST employees, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; and (5) The administrative and manage- ment controls that will be applied to assure compliance with applicable stat-utes, OPM regulations, the agency’s written procedures established under this section, the applicable maximum rate of basic pay in §534.504(a), and, where applicable, the certification re-quirements set forth in part 430, sub-part D of this chapter. In an agency that employs ten or more senior profes-sionals, these controls must include centralized review of ratings proposed under §430.208 of this chapter and pay actions proposed under §534.507 by a panel of individuals designated by the agency head to provide advice from an agency-wide perspective for authorized agency officials to consider before ap-proving pay adjustments on whether— (i) Ratings of record and performance ratings proposed for senior profes-sionals accurately reflect their indi-vidual performance, contributions to agency performance, or both, and take into account, as appropriate, assess-ment of the agency’s performance against program performance measures and other relevant considerations; and (ii) Proposed pay adjustments for senior professionals conform to the re-quirements of §534.507 and appro-priately correspond to proposed ratings of record and performance ratings. (b) Each agency’s written procedure must provide that, effective at the be-ginning of the first applicable pay pe-riod commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjust- ment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the Gen-eral Schedule, the head of an agency will adjust a senior professional’s rate of basic pay under the provisions of §534.507.

A rate of basic pay equal to or above the amount derived using the following rules is considered to be within the highest 10 percent of the ap-plicable pay range (in 2015, $177,166 or above if the applicable system is cer-tified, or $164,026 or above if the appli-cable system is not certified or per-formance appraisal does not apply): (i) Subtract the minimum rate of basic pay from the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable rate range under §534.504 (in 2015, $183,300 ¥$121,956 = $61,344 if the applicable system is cer-tified, or $168,700 ¥$121,956 = $46,744 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply); (ii) Multiply the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by 0.10 (in 2015, $61,344 ¥ 0.10 = $6,134 if the applicable system is certified, or $46,744 ¥ 0.10 = $4,674 if the applicable system is not certified or performance ap-praisal does not apply); and (iii) Subtract the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the maximum rate of basic pay appli-cable under §534.504 (in 2015, $183,300 ¥$6,134 = $177,166 if the applica- ble system is certified, or $168,700 ¥$4,674 = $164,026 if the applica- ble system is not certified or perform-ance appraisal does not apply); (2) Any pay increase under §534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the SL or ST em-ployee’s rate of basic pay as in effect on the', 'lower-paid special rate po-sition from a special rate position; (4) A management action that places an employee under a different pay schedule; (5) A management action that places an employee in a formal employee de-velopment program generally utilized Governmentwide (e.g., Recent Grad-uates Program); or (6) A reduction or elimination of scheduled rates, special schedules, or special rate schedules, excluding— (i) A statutory reduction in sched- uled rates of pay under the General Schedule, including a reduction au-thorized under 5 U.S.C. 5303(b); or (ii) A statutory reduction in a pre- vailing rate schedule established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, and 5 CFR part 532. (b) An agency must establish a re- tained rate when application of a pro-motion increase rule for General Schedule or prevailing rate employees results in a payable rate of basic pay that exceeds the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee’s new position. (See the pro-motion increase rules in 5 U.S.C. 5334(b) and 5 CFR 531.214 for GS em-ployees and in 5 CFR 532.407 for pre-vailing rate employees—in particular, the special provisions in these pro-motion increase rules on establishing a retained rate equal to an employee’s existing rate when that existing rate exceeds the applicable range max-imum.) Once established, such a re-tained rate is governed by the provi-sions of this subpart. (c) If an employee’s official worksite changes in conjunction with an action that may entitle the employee to pay retention under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must apply the ge-ographic conversion rule in §536.303(a) before determining whether an employ-ee’s rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced. (d) An employee is considered ‘‘placed’’ under paragraph (a)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section only when the employee remains in a position in the same agency. Optional pay retention under §536.302 may apply when an em-ployee transfers to a different agency as a result of a reduction in force or re-classification action or is selected by a different agency to fill a position under a formal employee development pro-gram, if all other qualifying conditions are met. (e) Eligibility for pay retention under this section ceases under the condi-tions specified in §536.308.

(a) Subject to the requirements in §536.102 and this section, an authorized agency official may provide pay reten-tion to an employee not entitled to pay retention under §536.301, but whose payable rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced (after application of any applicable geographic conversion under §536.303(a)) as the result of a management action. This includes a management action to move an em-ployee’s position, without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a De-partment of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) to a posi-tion under a covered pay system in the same agency. (b) If an employee’s official worksite changes in conjunction with an action that may entitle the employee to pay retention under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must apply the ge-ographic conversion rule in §536.303(a) before determining whether an employ-ee’s rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced. (c) Eligibility for pay retention under this section ceases under the condi-tions specified in §536.308. § 536.303 Geographic conversion. (a) Geographic conversion at time of ac- tion that may provide initial entitlement to pay retention. If, in conjunction with a pay action that may entitle the em-ployee to pay retention under §§536.301 or 536.302, an employee’s official work-site is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agen-cy must convert the employee’s rate(s) VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00590 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR581 Office of Personnel Management § 536.304 of basic pay to the applicable pay schedule(s) in the new location before applying the pay retention rules in this subpart or any other simultaneous pay action (other than a general pay ad-justment). The agency must identify the highest applicable rate range that would apply to the employee’s position of record before the pay action as if that position were stationed at the new official worksite and determine the employee’s converted payable rate of basic pay based on the step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) in that range that corresponds to the employee’s step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) before the pay action. A reduction in an employ-ee’s payable rate of basic pay resulting from this geographic conversion is not a basis for entitlement to pay reten-tion. The pay retention rules in this subpart must be applied as if the em-ployee’s payable rate of basic pay after geographic conversion is the employ-ee’s existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the ac-tion. (b) Geographic conversion when a re- tained rate employee’s official worksite is changed. When an employee is receiv- ing a retained rate and the employee’s official worksite is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agency must apply the fol-lowing rules (after applying any simul-taneous general pay adjustment under §536.305) to derive the converted re-tained rate that will be used as the ex-isting retained rate in determining the employee’s pay retention entitlement in the new position of record and at the new official worksite: (1) Identify the maximum rate for the highest applicable rate range that ap-plies to the employee’s former position of record based on the former official worksite; (2) Identify the maximum rate for the highest applicable rate range that would apply to the employee’s former position of record if the employee were stationed at the official worksite for the new position of record; (3) Divide the maximum rate identi- fied in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the maximum rate identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and round the result to the fourth decimal place; and (4) Multiply the factor resulting from paragraph (b)(3) of this section by the employee’s former retained rate and round to the nearest whole dollar (for an annual rate) or the nearest whole cent (for an hourly rate) to derive the employee’s converted retained rate at the new official worksite.

(a) A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an appli-cant’s credit background of the sort asked on the OF–306, Declaration for Federal Employment, or other forms used to conduct suitability investiga-tions for Federal employment ( i.e., in- quiries into an applicant’s adverse credit history) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employ-ment to the applicant. Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant’s Se-lective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, where appli-cable, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of em- ployment to an applicant. (b) However, in certain situations, agencies may have a business need to obtain information about the credit background of applicants earlier in the hiring process to determine if they meet the qualifications requirements or are suitable for the position being filled. If so, agencies must request an exception from the Office of Personnel Management in order to determine an applicant’s ability to meet qualifica-tions or suitability for Federal employ-ment prior to making a conditional offer of employment to the appli-cant(s). OPM will grant exceptions only when the agency demonstrates specific job-related reasons why the agency needs to evaluate an applicant’s adverse credit history earlier in the process. OPM will consider such factors as, but not limited to, the nature of the position being filled and whether a clean credit history record would be es-sential to the ability to perform one of the duties of the position effectively. OPM may also consider positions for which the expense of completing the examination makes it appropriate to review an applicant’s credit back-ground at the outset of the process (e.g., a position that requires that an applicant complete a rigorous training regimen and pass an examination based VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00246 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR237 Office of Personnel Management § 332.301 upon the training before the appli- cant’s selection can be finalized).

2. Managers: Understanding RIF exception circumstances helps them strategically manage workforce reductions while minimizing potential legal challenges.

3. Federal Employees: Knowing potential exceptions provides insight into their rights and potential protections during organizational restructuring.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the intricate regulatory landscape surrounding workforce reductions in federal agencies. It goes beyond surface-level knowledge and seeks to explore the specific conditions that might allow procedural flexibility during a sensitive employment process.

The technical nature of the question suggests it's likely coming from someone with a deep interest in federal employment law, potentially an HR professional, employment lawyer, or senior manager responsible for organizational planning. Its specificity makes it highly valuable for anyone needing comprehensive knowledge of federal employment regulations related to workforce reductions."
" What is a Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA), and what are the key eligibility criteria for a covered veteran?
"," A Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) is an excepted appointment that allows qualified covered veterans to be hired into competitive service positions without going through the standard competitive examining system. A covered veteran can be:
1. A disabled veteran
2. A veteran who served during a war or campaign with an authorized campaign badge
3. A veteran who participated in a U.S. military operation receiving an Armed Forces Service Medal
4. A recently separated veteran (within three years of discharge)

To be eligible, the veteran must:
- Have been separated under honorable conditions
- Meet the qualification standards for the position
- Be appointed to positions up to and including GS-11 or equivalent
- Upon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, the VRA will convert to a career or career conditional appointment","['part implements 38 U.S.C. 4214 and Executive Order 11521, which au-thorizes agencies to appoint qualified covered veterans to positions in the competitive service under Veterans Re-cruitment Appointments (VRAs) with-out regard to the competitive exam-ining system. § 307.102 Definitions. For purposes of this part— Agency , as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(5), means any agency of the Federal Gov-ernment or the District of Columbia, including any Executive agency as de-fined in section 105 of title 5, and the United States Postal Service and Post-al Rate Commission. Covered veterans , as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3), means any of the fol-lowing: (1) Disabled veterans; (2) Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been au-thorized; (3) Veterans who, while serving on active duty with the Armed Forces, participated in a United States mili-tary operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal (AFSM) was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985 (61 FR 1209); and (4) Recently separated veterans. Disabled veteran , as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211 means: (1) A veteran who is entitled to com- pensation (or who, but for the receipt of military retired pay, would be enti-tled to compensation) under laws ad-ministered by the Secretary of Vet-erans Affairs; or (2) A person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability. Qualified , as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3) with respect to employment in a position, means having the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reason- able accommodation for an individual with a disability. Recently separated veteran , as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(6), means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran’s discharge or release from active duty. Substantially continuous service is de- fined in 5 CFR 315.201(b)(3). War means any armed conflict de- clared by Congress as such. § 307.103 Nature of VRAs. VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions otherwise in the competitive service. The veterans’ preference procedures of part 302 of this chapter apply when there are preference eligible candidates being considered for a VRA. Qualified covered veterans who were separated under honorable conditions may be ap- pointed to any position in the competi-tive service at grade levels up to and including GS–11 or equivalent, provided they meet the qualification standards for the position. To be eligible for a VRA as a covered veteran under para- graph (2) or (3) of the definition of that term in §307.102, the veteran must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expeditionary medal, or AFSM. For purposes of a VRA, any military service is qualifying at the GS–3 level or equivalent. Upon satisfactory com-pletion of 2 years of substantially con-tinuous service, the incumbent’s VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment. An indi-vidual may receive more than one VRA appointment as long as the individual meets the definition of a covered vet- eran at the time of appointment. § 307.104 Treatment of individuals serving under VRAs. (a) Because VRAs are made to posi- tions otherwise in the competitive service, the incumbents, like competi-tive service employees, may be reas-signed, promoted, demoted, or trans-ferred in accordance with the provi-sions of part 335 of this chapter. (b) A veteran with less than 15 years of education must receive training or education prescribed by the agency. (c) Appointments are subject to in- vestigation by OPM.

(d) The Veterans Recruitment Ap- pointment date for a recently separated veteran must occur before the end of the 3-year eligibility period and may not be extended. § 307.105 Appeal rights. Individuals serving under VRAs have the same appeal rights as excepted service employees under parts 432 and 752 of this chapter. In addition, as es-tablished in §315.806 of this chapter, any individual serving under a VRA, whose employment under the appoint-ment is terminated within 1 year after the date of such appointment, has the same right to appeal that termination as a career or career-conditional em-ployee has during the first year of em-ployment.

Volunteer Service under the Act is limited to services performed by a stu-dent, with the permission of the insti-tution at which the student is enrolled, as part of an agency program estab- lished for the purpose of providing edu-cational experience for the student. Such service is to be uncompensated and will not be used to displace any employee or to staff a position which is a normal part of the agency’s work force. § 308.102 Eligibility and status. (a) Minimum Age. The selection of students to participate under the pro-gram should be in conformance with ei-ther Federal, State, or local laws and standards governing the employment of minors. (b) Status. A student participating under an agency volunteer program is not considered to be a Federal em-ployee for any purposes other than in-jury compensation or laws related to the Tort Claims Act. Service is not creditable for leave accrual or any other employee benefits. § 308.103 Authority. Section 301 of the Civil Service Re- form Act of 1978, Public Law 95–454, au-thorized Federal departments and agencies to establish programs de-signed to provide educationally related work assignments for students in non-pay status.

(c) When experience is a factor in de- termining eligibility, OPM shall credit a preference eligible with: (1) Time spent in the military service (i) as an extension of time spent in the position in which he was employed im-mediately before his entrance into the military service, or (ii) on the basis of actual duties performed in the military service, or (iii) as a combination of both methods. OPM shall credit time spent in the military service according to the method that will be of most ben-efit to the preference eligible.

(a) Employees who are in a retained grade must have the experience they gain subsequent to the downgrading ac-tion that placed them in a retained grade considered in the following man-ner. For placements during the period the employee is in a retained grade, agencies must consider the experience subsequent to the downgrading action to be either: (1) At the level of the retained grade and in the series of the position which he or she occupied at the time of the downgrading; or (2) At the grade and in the series of the position to which the employee is downgraded. (b) Agencies must determine which experience to consider on the basis of which will most likely result in place-ment. For placements or promotions after the retained grade period, the ex-perience is considered only at the grade level and in the series of the position to which the employee was down-graded.

(3) If personal inspection is imprac- tical, arrangements shall be made to end copies of such records to the em-ployee. (e) Hearing official. The Office may re- quest an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing, or the Office may obtain a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Director of OPM. (f) Obtaining the services of a hearing official when OPM is the creditor agency. (1) When the debtor is not an OPM em-ployee and the Office cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the Office may contact an agent of the paying agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or other individual des-ignated by the paying agency, and re-quest a hearing official. (2) When the debtor is an OPM em- ployee, the Office may contact any agent of another agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or otherwise designated by that agency, to request a hearing official. (g) Procedure —(1) General. After the employee requests a hearing, the hear-ing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time and loca-tion of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be noti-fied that he or she should submit argu-ments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation. (2) Oral hearing. An employee who re- quests an oral hearing shall be pro-vided an oral hearing if the hearing of-ficial determines that the matter can-not be resolved by review of documen-tary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adju-dication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not lim-ited to: (i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument; (ii) Informal meetings with an inter- view of the employee; or (iii) Formal written submissions with an opportunity for oral presentation. (3) Paper hearing. If the hearing offi- cial determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a determination based upon a review of the available written record (4 CFR 102.3(c) (2) and (3)). (4) Record. The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart (4 CFR 102.3(c)(1)(ii)). Witnesses who tes-tify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation. (h) Date of decision. The hearing offi- cial shall issue a written opinion stat-ing his or her decision, based upon doc-umentary evidence and information de-veloped at the hearing, as soon as prac-ticable after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the petition was received by the cred-itor agency, unless the employee re-quests a delay in the proceedings. In such case the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was post-poned. (i) Content of decision. The written de- cision shall include: (1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; (2) The hearing official’s findings, analysis, and conclusions including a determination whether the debtor’s pe-tition for hearing was baseless and re-sulted from an intent to delay creditor agency collection activity and whether the Office should pursue other actions VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR35 Office of Personnel Management § 179.209 against the debtor as provided by 5 CFR 550.1104(d)(11); and (3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable. (j) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., illness), an em-ployee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled and make his/ her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documen-tary evidence submitted by both par-ties. With the agreement of both par-ties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date. Both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing. § 179.208 Certification. (a) OPM salary offset coordinator shall provide a certification to the pay-ing agency in all cases where: (1) The hearing official determines that a debt exists; (2) The employee fails to contest the existence and amount of the debt by failing to request a hearing; or (3) The employee fails to contest the existence of the debt by failing to ap-pear at a hearing. (b) The certification must be in writ- ing and must state: (1) That the employee owes the debt; (2) The amount and basis of the debt; (3) The date the Government’s right to collect the debt first accrued; (4) That the Office’s regulations have been approved by OPM pursuant to 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; (5) The date on which payment(s) is due; (6) If the collection is to be made in installments, the number of install-ments to be collected, the amount of each installment or percentage of dis-posable pay, and the commencement date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially estab-lished pay period is required; and (7) The date(s) of any action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b). § 179.209 Voluntary repayment agree- ment as alternative to salary offset. (a)(1) In response to a notice of in- tent, an employee may propose to repay the debt by making voluntary in-stallment payments as an alternative to salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a pro-posed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must: (i) Be in writing; (ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency; (iii) Specify all the terms of the ar- rangement for payment; and (iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result in a', 'Counsel to the Inspector General, Office of In- spector General: USDA, Whitten Buildinguiin1400 Independence Avenue SW, STOP 2308, Room 441–E, Washington, DC 20250–2308, (202) 720–9110.

This subpart sets the conditions under which an agency may furlough career appointees in the Senior Execu-tive Service. The furlough of a non-career, limited term, or limited emer-gency appointee is not subject to this subpart. The furlough of a reemployed annuitant holding a career appoint-ment also is not subject to the subpart. § 359.802 Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart, fur- lough means the placing of an ap- pointee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary rea-sons. § 359.803 Competition. Any furlough for more than 30 cal- endar days, or for more than 22 work-days if the furlough does not cover con-secutive calendar days, shall be made under competitive procedures estab-lished by the agency. The procedures shall be made known to the SES mem-bers in the agency. [48 FR 11925, Mar. 2, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 6389, Feb. 2, 1995] § 359.804 Length of furlough.

A career appointee who has been fur- loughed and who believes this subpart or the agency’s procedures have not been correctly applied may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under provisions of the Board’s regula-tions. § 359.806 Notice. (a) An appointee is entitled to a 30 days’ advance written notice of a fur-lough. The full notice period may be shortened, or waived, only in the event of unforseeable circumstances, such as sudden emergencies requiring imme-diate curtailment of activities. (b) The written notice shall advise the appointee of: (1) The reason for the agency decision to take the furlough action. (2) The expected duration of the fur- lough and the effective dates; (3) The basis for selecting the ap- pointee for furlough when some but not all Senior Executive Service ap-pointees in a given organizational unit are being furloughed; (4) The reason if the notice period is less than 30 days; (5) The place where the appointee may inspect the regulations and records pertinent to the action; and (6) The appointee’s appeal rights, in- cluding the time limit for the appeal and the location of the Merit Systems Protection Board office to which the appeal should be sent. § 359.807 Records.

The question directly addresses a specific hiring authority under Title 5 that is critically important for veterans transitioning to federal employment, HR specialists managing recruitment, and managers seeking to understand special hiring pathways.

The question is highly relevant because:
1. It focuses on a specific hiring mechanism designed to support veterans
2. Seeks to clarify both the definition and eligibility criteria of the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)
3. Addresses an important aspect of federal employment policy related to veteran hiring preferences

The practicality is strong because:
- Veterans frequently seek to understand their federal employment opportunities
- HR professionals need clear guidance on implementing VRA hiring
- Managers can benefit from understanding this specialized recruitment pathway

The information need is substantive, covering both the conceptual definition and specific eligibility requirements, which makes it valuable for comprehensive understanding.

Applicability is broad, potentially helping:
- Veterans seeking federal employment
- HR specialists processing veteran applications
- Managers looking to recruit qualified veteran candidates
- Federal employment policy researchers

The question represents a precise, focused inquiry into an important aspect of federal employment regulations, making it highly useful across multiple stakeholder groups."
" Can a temporary employee be reappointed, and what are the conditions for such reappointment?
"," According to §316.402(b)(7), an agency may reappoint a former temporary employee with the following conditions:

1. The employee was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under part 333
2. The employee has not already served the maximum time allowed under §316.401
3. The position has not been filled under temporary appointment for the maximum allowed time
4. Reappointment must be to:
- The same position, or
- Another position with the same qualification requirements appropriate for temporary appointment

Additionally, if the employee sustained a compensable injury during their previous temporary appointment, they may have more flexible reappointment options, potentially to a different position for which they are qualified.","['may not fill a position by temporary appointment if that posi-tion has previously been filled by tem-porary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the pre-ceding 3-year period.

(ii) Employment in the same or a successor position under this and any other appointing authority totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee’s initial appointment in the agency.

In accordance with the time lim- its in §316.401, an agency may make a temporary appointment under part 332 of this chapter, by using competitive procedures, or under part 337 of this chapter, by using direct-hire proce-dures, as appropriate. (b) Noncompetitive temporary appoint- ments. In accordance with the time lim- its in §316.401, an agency may give a noncompetitive temporary appoint-ment, without regard to the require-ments of parts 332 and 333 of this chap-ter, to an individual who is qualified for the position and who is eligible for: (1) Reinstatement under §315.401 of this chapter; (2) Veterans recruitment appoint- ment under §307.103 of this chapter. Temporary limited appointments under this section are permitted only at the grade levels authorized for VRA appointments. Such appointments are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion to career-conditional ap-pointment; (3) Career-conditional appointment under §315.601, 315.604, 315.605, 315.606, 315.607, 315.608, 315.609, 315.612, 315.703, or 315.711 of this chapter; (4) Appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 (veterans with compensable service- connected disability of 30 percent of more).

(b) Specific exemptions —(1) Inspector General Investigations Case File Records (OPM/CENTRAL–4). All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) is exempt from the re-quirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclo-sures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemp-tions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are as follows: (i) Inspector General investigations may contain properly classified infor-mation that pertains to national de-fense and foreign policy obtained from other systems or another Federal agen-cy. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject’s access to and amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d). (ii) Inspector General investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2); e.g., investigations into the administration of the merit system. Application of exemption (k)(2) may be necessary to preclude the data subject’s access to or amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and (d). (iii) Inspector General investigations may contain information obtained from another system or Federal agency that relates to providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056. Application of exemp-tion (k)(3) may be necessary to pre-clude the data subject’s access to and amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d). (iv) Inspector General case files may contain information that, by statute, is required to be maintained and used solely as a statistical record. Applica-tion of exemption (k)(4) may be nec-essary to ensure compliance with such a statutory mandate. (v) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). This exemption is claimed because this system contains investigatory material that if disclosed may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Gov-ernment under an express promise that the source’s identity would be held in confidence or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise. The ap-plication of exemption (k)(5) will be re-quired to honor promises of confiden-tiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the records, or access to the accounting of disclo-sures of the record. (vi) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the re-quirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of a case file record may relate to testing and exam-ining material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appoint-ment or promotion in the Federal serv-ice. Access to or amendment of this in-formation by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fair-ness of the testing or examining proc-ess. (vii) Inspector General case files may contain evaluation material used to de-termine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemp-tion (k)(7) may be necessary, but only to the extent that the disclosure of the data would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. (2) Administrative Law Judge Applicant Records (OPM/CENTRAL–6). (i) All in- formation about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(3) and (d). The exemptions are claimed because this system contains investiga-tory material compiled solely for de-termining suitability, eligibility, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR128 5 CFR Ch.

(ii) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the re-quirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of the records by the data subject. This ex-emption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing and exam-ining materials used solely to deter-mine individual qualifications for ap-pointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examing proc-ess. (3) Litigation and Claims Records (OPM/CENTRAL–7). (i) When litigation or claim cases occur, information from other existing systems of records may be incorporated into the case file. This information may be material for which exemptions have been claimed by the Office in this section. To the extent that such exempt material is incor-porated into a litigation or claim case file, the appropriate exemption (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7)) shall also apply to the material as it appears in this system. The exemp-tions will be only from those provisions of the Act that were claimed for the systems from which the records origi-nated. (ii) During the course of litigation or claims cases, it may be necessary to conduct investigations to develop in-formation and evidence relevant to the case. These investigative records may include material meeting the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7). Such material is ex-empt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Act relate to making accounting of disclosures available to the data sub-ject and access to and amendment of records.

[60 FR 43946, Aug. 23, 1995; 60 FR 47646, Sept. 13, 1995] § 451.104 Awards. (a) An agency may grant a cash, hon- orary, or informal recognition award, or grant time-off without charge to leave or loss of pay consistent with chapter 45 of title 5, United States Code, and this part to an employee, as an individual or member of a group, on the basis of— (1) A suggestion, invention, superior accomplishment, productivity gain, or other personal effort that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government oper-ations or achieves a significant reduc-tion in paperwork; (2) A special act or service in the pub- lic interest in connection with or re-lated to official employment; or (3) Performance as reflected in the employee’s most recent rating of record (as defined in §430.203 of this chapter), provided that the rating of record is at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or above, except that performance awards may be paid to SES members only under §534.405 of this chapter and not on the basis of this subpart. (b) A cash award under this subpart is a lump sum payment and is not basic pay for any purpose. (c) An award is subject to applicable tax rules, such as withholding. (d) When an award is approved for— (1) An employee of another agency, the benefiting agency shall make ar-rangements to transfer funds to the employing agency to cover the award. If the administrative costs of transfer-ring funds would exceed the amount of the award, the employing agency shall absorb the award costs and pay the award; and (2) A member of the armed forces for a suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement, arrangements shall be made to transfer funds to the agency having jurisdiction over the member in accordance with E.O. 11438, ‘‘Pre-scribing Procedures Governing Inter-departmental Cash Awards to the Members of the Armed Forces’’. (e) An award may be granted to a separated employee or the legal heir(s) or estate of a deceased employee. (f) A time-off award granted under this subpart shall not be converted to a cash payment under any cir-cumstances. (g) When granting an award paid as a percentage of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 4505a(a)(2), the rate of basic pay used must include any applicable locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; special rate supplement under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; or similar payment or supplement under other legal au-thority. For an employee receiving a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536, sub-part C (or similar authority, such as 5 CFR 359.705), the rate of basic pay is the maximum payable rate for the em-ployee’s grade or level, rather than the retained rate.

(a) In', 'request is made. In determining whether a re-quest properly belongs in this cat-egory, OPM will look first to the in-tended use of the documents being re-quested. (b) Request for non-commercial use made by an educational or non-commer-cial scientific institution. OPM will in- clude requesters in one of the two cat-egories described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section when the request is being made as authorized by, and under the auspices of, a qualifying in-stitution; and the records are sought, not for a commercial use, but in fur-therance of scholarly or scientific re-search. (1) Educational institution refers to any public or private, preschool, ele-mentary, or secondary school, institu-tion of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of pro-fessional or vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly or scientific research. (2) A non-commercial scientific institu- tion refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely to conduct scientific or schol-arly research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. (c) Request from a representative of the news media. ‘‘Representative of the news media’’ refers to any person ac-tively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to pub-lish, broadcast, or otherwise dissemi-nate news to the public. The term ‘‘news’’ means information that is about current events or that would be VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR106 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 294.104 of current interest to the public. Exam- ples of news media entities include tel-evision or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. Free-lance jour-nalists may be regarded as representa-tives of the news media if they dem-onstrate a solid basis for expecting publication, or some other form of dis-semination, through a particular orga-nization even though they are not ac-tually employed by it. OPM will assign news media officials to this category only when a request is not for commer-cial use. If a person meets the other qualifications for inclusion, OPM will not apply the term ‘‘commercial use’’ to his or her request for records in sup-port of a news dissemination function. (d) Requests from others. The category ‘‘all others,’’ consists of any requesters not covered by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section. However, as pro-vided by §294.105, OPM will use its Pri-vacy Act regulations, rather than this subpart, when individuals ask for records about themselves that may be filed in OPM systems of records. § 294.104 Clarifying a requester’s cat- egory. (a) Seeking clarification of a requester’s category. OPM may seek additional clarification before assigning a person to a specific category if— (1) There is reasonable cause to doubt the requester’s intended use of records; or (2) The intended use is not clear from the request itself; or (3) There is any other reasonable doubt about qualifications that may af-fect the fees applicable or the services rendered under §294.109. (b) Prompt notification to requester. When OPM seeks clarification as pro-vided by paragraph (a) of this section, it will provide prompt notification ei-ther by telephone or in writing of the information or materials needed. (c) Effect of seeking clarification on time limits for responding. When apply- ing the time limits in section 552 of title 5, United States Code, OPM will not officially consider any request for records as being received until the offi-cial who is assigned responsibility for making a decision on releasing the records has received any additional clarification sought under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; and has de-termined that the clarifying informa-tion is sufficient to correctly place the requester in one of the categories pre-scribed in this section. If the requested clarifying information is not received within a reasonable time, OPM will, based on the information available, de-termine a final category for the re-quest and calculate applicable fees.

When the subject of a record, or a duly authorized representative of the subject, requests his or her own records from a Privacy Act system of records, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a (a)(5), and the record is maintained so that it is retrieved by the subject’s name or other personal identifier, OPM will process the request under the Privacy Act procedures in part 297 of this chap-ter. § 294.106 Handbook of Publications, Periodicals, and OPM Issuances. (a)(1) Annually, OPM publishes OPM- AG-PSD-01, ‘‘Handbook of Publica-tions, Periodicals, and Issuances,’’ and accompanying addendum. This hand-book and addendum lists material pub-lished and offered for sale are available for public inspection or copying. Unless the material is published and offered for sale, OPM makes available for pub-lic inspection and copying: (i) Final opinions made by OPM in the adjudication of cases; (ii) OPM policy statements and inter- pretations adopted by OPM but not published in the F EDERAL REGISTER ; and (iii) OPM administrative staff manu- als and instructions that affect a mem-ber of the public.

The question directly addresses a specific employment policy issue under Title 5, which governs federal employment regulations. It is particularly useful for:

1. HR Specialists: Provides critical guidance on the rules and limitations surrounding temporary employee reappointments, helping them ensure compliance with federal hiring regulations.

2. Managers: Offers insights into workforce planning and the legal constraints of rehiring temporary employees, which is crucial for strategic staffing decisions.

3. Temporary Employees: Helps them understand their potential for continued employment and the conditions under which they might be reappointed.

The question touches on a common and practical concern in federal employment - the status and potential continuity of temporary workers. It seeks substantive information about reappointment conditions, which is directly relevant to Title 5 regulations governing federal employment. The information would help stakeholders understand the legal framework for temporary employee rehiring, potential limitations, and procedural requirements.

The broad applicability across different federal employment contexts and the potential to provide actionable information make this a highly valuable question for anyone involved in or researching federal employment policies."

"," For military service exceeding 180 days, the employee must submit an application for reemployment within 90 days after completing their service period. If they are hospitalized or convalescing from an injury incurred during service, they have up to 2 years to report for duty.

The employee is ex- pected to provide the agency with as much advance notice as possible when- ever military duty or training will interfere with civilian work. When a conflict arises between the Reserve duty and the legitimate needs of the employer, the agency may contact ap-propriate military authorities to ex-press concern. Where the request would require the employee to be absent from work for an extended period, during times of acute need, or when, in light of previous leaves, the requested leave is cumulatively burdensome, the agen-cy may contact the military com-mander of the employee’s military unit to determine if the military duty could be rescheduled or performed by another member. If the military authorities de-termine that the military duty cannot be rescheduled or cancelled, the agency is required to permit the employee to perform his or her military duty.

By law, members of the Selected Reserve (a component of the Ready Reserve), can be called up under a presidential order for purposes other than training for as long as 270 days. If the President de-clares a national emergency, the re-mainder of the Ready Reserve—the In-dividual Ready Reserve and the Inac-tive National Guard—may be called up. The Ready Reserve as a whole is sub-ject to as much as 24 consecutive months of active duty in a national emergency declared by the President.

Periods allowed for return to duty are based on the length of time the per-son was performing service in the uni- formed services, as follows: (a) An employee whose uniformed service was for less than 31 days, or who was absent for the purpose of an exam-ination to determine fitness for the uniformed services, is required to re-port back to work not later than the beginning of the first regularly sched-uled work day on the first full calendar day following completion of the period of service and the expiration of 8 hours after a period allowing for the safe transportation of the employee from the place of service to the employee’s residence, or as soon as possible after the expiration of the 8-hour period if reporting within the above period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee. (b) If the service was for more than 30 but less than 181 days, the employee must submit an application for reem-ployment with the agency not later than 14 days after completing the pe-riod of service. (If submitting the ap-plication is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the individual, it must be submitted the next full cal-endar day when it becomes possible to do so.) (c) If the period of service was for more than 180 days, the employee must submit an application for reemploy-ment not later than 90 days after com-pleting the period of service. (d) An employee who is hospitalized or convalescing from an injury or ill-ness incurred in, or aggravated during uniformed service is required to report for duty at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover, based on the length of service as dis-cussed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, except that the period of recovery may not exceed 2 years (ex-tended by the minimum time required to accommodate circumstances beyond the employee’s control which make re-porting within the period specified im-possible or unreasonable). (e) A person who does not report within the time limits specified does not automatically forfeit restoration rights, but, rather, is subject to what-ever policy and disciplinary action the agency would normally apply for a similar absence without authorization.

(5) The following types of premium pay (to the extent such premium pay was actually payable to the employee): (i) Night differential under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f) at the applicable percentage rate received by a prevailing rate em-ployee for all regularly scheduled peri-ods of night shift duty covered by the unused annual leave as if the employee had continued to work beyond the ef-fective date of separation, death, or transfer. In the case of an employee who is assigned to a regular rotating schedule involving work on both day and night shifts, the night differential is payable for that portion of the lump- sum period that would have occurred when the employee was scheduled to work night shifts. (ii) Premium pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c) or 5545a if the employee was re-ceiving premium pay for the pay period VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00673 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR664 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 550.1205 immediately prior to the date the em- ployee became eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203. The agency must base the lump-sum payment on the percentage rate received by the employee for the pay period imme-diately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-sum pay-ment under §550.1203. In cases where the amount of premium pay actually payable in the final pay period was lim-ited by a statutory cap, the agency must base the lump-sum payment on a reduced percentage rate that reflects the actual amount of premium pay the employee received in that pay period. (iii) Overtime pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545b and §550.1304 of this chapter for overtime hours in an employee’s un-common tour of duty (as defined in §630.201 of this chapter), established in accordance with §630.210 of this chap-ter. The uncommon tour of duty must be applicable to the employee for the pay period immediately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203. The agency must calculate overtime pay using the same methodology it used to calculate the employee’s enti-tlement to overtime pay as provided in §550.1304 of this chapter in the pay pe-riod immediately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump- sum payment under §550.1203. An agen-cy may not change an employee’s work schedule for the sole purpose of avoid-ing or providing payment of premium pay under §550.1205(b)(5)(i)–(iv) in a lump-sum payment. (iv) An overtime supplement for reg- ularly scheduled overtime within a Border Patrol agent’s regular tour of duty under 5 U.S.C. 5550, as in effect immediately prior to the date the agent became eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203. The agency must base the lump-sum payment on the agent’s assigned overtime supple-ment percentage. The assigned percent-age will be considered fixed for the du-ration of the lump-sum annual leave projection period described in §550.1204, even if an annual period for elections under 5 U.S.C. 5550 begins during that projection period. In cases where the amount of the overtime supplement ac-tually payable in a pay period was lim-ited by a statutory cap, the agency must base the lump-sum payment on a reduced percentage rate that reflects the actual amount of the overtime sup-plement the agent could receive in a pay period. (6) Overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amend-ed (FLSA), for overtime work that is regularly scheduled during an employ-ee’s established uncommon tour of duty, as defined in §630.201(b)(1) of this chapter and established under §630.210(a) of this chapter, for which the employee receives standby duty pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1). The agen-cy must include FLSA overtime pay in a lump-sum payment if an uncommon tour of duty was applicable to the em-ployee for the pay period immediately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203. The agency must calculate FLSA overtime pay using the same methodology it used to calculate the employee’s entitlement to FLSA over-time pay for the pay period imme-diately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-sum pay-ment under §550.1203. An agency may not change an employee’s work sched-ule for the sole purpose of avoiding or providing payment of FLSA overtime pay in a lump-sum payment. (7) A supervisory differential under 5 U.S.C. 5755 based on the percentage rate (or dollar amount) received by the employee for the pay period imme-diately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-sum pay-ment under §550.1203. (8) A cost-of-living allowance and/or post differential in a nonforeign area under 5 U.S.C. 5941 if the employee’s of-ficial duty station is in the nonforeign area when he or she becomes eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203. (9) A post allowance in a foreign area under 5 U.S.C. 5924(1) and the Standard- ized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) if the employee’s offi-cial duty station is in the foreign area when he or she becomes eligible for a lump-sum payment under §550.1203.

Such regulations or stand- ards must be consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5551, 5552, 6306, and other applicable provisions of law. (d) A lump-sum payment may not in- clude any other pay not specifically listed in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. (e) An employee may not earn leave for the period covered by a lump-sum payment. (f) A lump-sum payment is not sub- ject to deductions for retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees’ Retirement System established by chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States Code, re-spectively; health benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program established by chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; life insur-ance under the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance program estab-lished by chapter 87 of title 5, United States Code; and savings under the Thrift Savings Plan established by sub-chapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code. (g) For a reemployed annuitant who becomes eligible for a lump-sum pay-ment under §550.1203, the agency must compute the lump-sum payment using the annuitant’s pay before any reduc-tions required under §837.303 of this chapter. (h) A lump-sum payment is subject to garnishment under parts', 'not reveal the names of applicants for civil service positions or eligibles on civil service registers, certificates, employment lists, or other lists of eligibles, or their ratings or relative standings.

Federal agencies may not, however, use a nonprofit employment service sponsored by a partisan polit-ical organization. By contract, a non-profit employment service supplies in-dividual candidates for consideration for specific Federal vacancies, in ac-cordance with the requirements set by the Federal agency. § 300.402 Coverage. This part applies to filling positions in the competitive service; positions in the expected service under Schedules A, B, and C; and positions in the Senior Executive Service. [57 FR 10124, Mar. 24, 1992] § 300.403 When commercial recruiting firms and nonprofit employment services may be used. An agency may use a commercial re- cruiting firm and/or a nonprofit em-ployment service in recruiting for va-cancies when: (a) The agency head or designee de- termines that such use is likely to pro-vide well-qualified candidates who would otherwise not be available or that well-qualified candidates are in short supply; (b) The agency has provided vacancy notices to appropriate State Employ-ment Service and OPM offices; and (c) The agency continues its own re- cruiting efforts. § 300.404 Use of fee-charging firms. (a) Federal agencies are prohibited from using commercial recruiting firms and nonprofit employment serv-ices which charge fees to individuals referred to Federal positions. Federal agencies may not consider a candidate referred by a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service if the individual has paid or is expected to pay any fee to the firm or service. (b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to reg-istration fees paid by individuals to nonprofit employment services oper-ated by professional organizations when the registration fee is imposed re-gardless of whether the registrant is referred for employment or placed. § 300.405 Requirement for contract. (a) A written contract awarded in ac- cordance with procedures stipulated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations is required between the Federal agency and a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service. The contract will satisfy the ‘‘written re-quest’’ required by 18 U.S.C. 211. That statute prohibits the acceptance of payment for aiding an individual to ob-tain Federal employment except when an employment agency renders serv-ices pursuant to the written request of an executive department or agency. (b) The contract must include the qualifications requirements for the po-sition(s) to be filled and also provide that the firm or service will: (1) Screen candidates only against the basic qualifications requirements for the position(s) specified by the Fed-eral agency in the contract and refer to the agency all candidates who appear to meet those requirements; (2) Refer to the Federal agency only those applicants from whom the firm or service has not accepted fees other than those permitted under §300.404(b) of this part; (3) Not imply that it is the sole or primary avenue for employment with the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency; and (4) Recruit and refer candidates in ac- cordance with applicable merit prin-ciples and equal opportunity laws. § 300.406 Agency responsibilities. (a) The purpose of a commercial re- cruiting firm or nonprofit employment service is to serve as an additional source of applicants. Once recruited, applicants must be evaluated and ap-pointed through regular civil service employment procedures. (1) For a competitive service posi- tion, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the terms of appli-cable competitive service procedures. (2) For an excepted service position, an individual must be appointed in ac-cordance with the terms of the applica-ble appointing authority and the re-quirements set out in part 302 of this chapter.

The question touches on several important aspects that are highly relevant to federal employees, HR specialists, and managers:

1. Relevance: It specifically addresses military service leave and reemployment rights, which are fundamental protections for federal employees who serve in the military.

2. Practicality: This is a very common and practical concern for federal employees who are also military reservists or National Guard members. Understanding reemployment rights is crucial for both employees and employers.

3. Information Need: The question seeks substantive information about the specific requirements and rights of employees called to extended military service, which is a complex but important area of federal employment policy.

4. Applicability: This information is directly applicable to multiple stakeholders:
- Federal employees who may be called to military service
- HR specialists who must process reemployment applications
- Managers who need to understand their obligations to service members
- Military reservists planning their civilian career alongside military service

The question demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the potential complexities surrounding military service and federal employment, making it an extremely valuable inquiry for anyone dealing with federal employment regulations."
" What are the key limitations on donating annual leave under the emergency leave transfer program?
"," According to §630.908, there are two primary limitations on annual leave donations:
1. In any one leave year, a leave donor may donate no more than one-half of the amount of annual leave they would be entitled to accrue during that year.
2. For employees with annual leave that would otherwise be forfeited at year-end, the maximum donation is the lesser of:
   - One-half of the annual leave they would accrue that year, or
   - The number of hours remaining in the leave year that they are scheduled to work and receive pay.

Each agency must establish written criteria for potential waivers to these limitations, and any waiver must be documented in writing.","['pay fixed by law or administrative action, exclusive of any locality-based adjustments (including adjustments equivalent to local special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C) or additional pay of any other kind.

When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law enforcement officers re-ceiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the cor-responding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Executive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as pro-vided in 5 CFR 530.304(a). Telework agreement means a formal oral or written agreement between a supervisor and an employee to permit the employee to work at an alternative worksite ( i.e., telework) instead of the location of the employee’s assigned or-ganization.

Subpart L—Family and Medical Leave SOURCE : 58 FR 39602, July 23, 1993, unless otherwise noted. § 630.1201 Purpose, applicability, and agency responsibilities. (a) Purpose. This subpart provides regulations to implement sections 6381 through 6387 of title 5, United States Code. This subpart must be read to-gether with those sections of law. Sec-tions 6381 through 6387 of title 5, United States Code, provide a standard ap-proach to providing family and medical leave to Federal employees by pre-scribing an entitlement to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs, as specified in §630.1203(a) of this part. This subpart also provides the basis for determining the periods of unpaid leave for which paid parental leave may be substituted under subpart Q of this part, which must be read with this subpart to establish eligibility. (b) Applicability. (1) Except as other- wise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this subpart applies to any em- ployee who— (i)(A) Is defined as an ‘‘employee’’ under 5 U.S.C. 6301(2); or (B) Is an employee carrying out screening functions who is appointed under section 111(d) of Public Law 107– 71 (49 U.S.C. 44935 note); and (ii) Has completed at least 12 months of service (excluding any service as an employee identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) at any time as— (A) An employee, as defined under 5 U.S.C. 6301(2); (B) An employee of the Veterans Health Administration appointed under title 38, United States Code, in occupa-tions listed in 38 U.S.C. 7421; (C) A ‘‘teacher’’ or an individual holding a ‘‘teaching position,’’ as de-fined in section 901 of title 20, United States Code; (D) An employee identified in section 2105(c) of title 5, United States Code, who is paid from nonappropriated funds; (E) An employee carrying out screen- ing functions who is appointed under section 111(d) of Public Law 107–71 (49 U.S.C. 44935 note); or (F) An employee performing covered active duty (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6381(7)(B)) that interrupts civilian serv-ice due to a qualifying call or order for deployment to a foreign country as a member of the National Guard or Re-serves, to the extent that such active duty is not already creditable service under paragraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii). (2) This subpart does not apply to— (i) An individual employed by the government of the District of Colum-bia; (ii) An employee serving under a temporary appointment with a time limitation of 1 year or less; (iii) An intermittent employee, as de- fined in 5 CFR 340.401(c); or (iv) Any employee covered by Title I or Title V of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (Pub.

Serv-ice will not be effective where parties fail to comply with the service of proc-ess provisions of this section, notwith-standing whether the person bringing the garnishment action has complied with the service of process require-ments of the jurisdiction issuing the legal process. § 582.203 Information minimally re- quired to accompany legal process. (a) Sufficient identifying information must accompany the legal process in order to enable processing by the agen-cy. Parties seeking garnishment ac-tions, therefore, should provide as many of the following identifying pieces of information concerning the employee-obligor as possible: (1) Full name; (2) Date of birth; (3) Employment number or social se- curity number; (4) Component of the agency for which the employee-obligor works; (5) Official duty station or worksite; and (6) Home address or current mailing address. (b) If the information submitted is not sufficient to identify the employee- obligor, the legal process shall be re-turned directly to the court, or other authority, with an explanation of the deficiency. However, prior to returning the legal process, if there is sufficient time prior to the time limits imposed in §582.303, an attempt should be made to inform the person who caused the legal process to be served, or the per-son’s representative, that it will not be honored unless adequate identifying in-formation is supplied. § 582.204 Electronic disbursement. The party designated to receive the garnished funds may forward a written request to the garnishing agency to have the funds remitted by electronic funds transfer, rather than by paper check. The request shall include the designated party’s name, address, and deposit account number, and the name, address, and 9-digit routing transit number of the designated party’s finan-cial institution. Written requests ac-companying service of process will be honored beginning with the first remis-sion of garnished funds. Written re-quests received by the agency subse-quent to service of process will be hon-ored in as timely a manner as the agen-cy deems feasible. Subpart C—Compliance With Legal Process § 582.301 Suspension of payment. Upon proper service of legal process as specified in §§582.202 and 582.203, the agency shall suspend, i.e., withhold, payment of such moneys for the amount necessary to permit compli-ance with the legal process in accord-ance with this part. § 582.302 Notification of employee-obli- gor. (a) As soon as possible, but not later than 15 calendar days after the date of valid service of legal process, the agent designated to accept legal process shall send to the employee-obligor, at his or her duty station or last known home address, written notice that such proc-ess has been served, including a copy of the legal process; (b) The agency may provide the em- ployee-obligor with the following addi-tional information: (1) Copies of any other documents submitted in support of or in addition to the legal process; (2) Notice that the United States does not represent the interests of the employee-obligor in the pending legal proceedings; and VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00815 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR806 5 CFR Ch.

(a) Whenever the designated agent is validly served with legal process, the agent shall respond within 30 calendar days after receipt, or within such longer period as may be prescribed by applicable State or local law. The agent shall also respond within this time period to interrogatories which accompany legal process. Notwith-standing State law, an agent need only respond once to legal process. (b) If State or local law authorizes the issuance of interrogatories prior to or after the issuance of legal process, the agent shall respond to the interrog-atories within 30 calendar days after being validly served, or within such longer period as may be prescribed by applicable State or local law. § 582.304 Nonliability for disclosure. (a) No agency employee whose duties include responding to interrogatories pursuant to §582.303(b), shall be subject to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty for any disclosure of information made in con-nection with the carrying out of any duties pertaining directly or indirectly to answering such interrogatories. (b) However, an agency would not be precluded from taking disciplinary ac-tion against an employee who consist-ently or purposely failed to provide correct information requested by inter-rogatories. § 582.305 Honoring legal process. (a) The agency shall comply with legal process, except where the process cannot be complied with because: (1) It is not regular on its face. (2) The legal process would require the withholding of funds not deemed pay as described in §582.102(a)(5). (3) It does not comply with section 5520a of title 5 of the United States Code or with the mandatory provisions of this part; or (4) An order of a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or suspending the operation of the legal process has been served on the agency. (b) While an agency will not comply with legal process which, on its face, indicates that it has expired or is oth-erwise no longer valid, legal process will be deemed valid notwithstanding the fact that the underlying debt and/ or the underlying judgment arose prior to the effective date of section 5520a of title 5 of the United States Code. (c)(1) The filing of an appeal by an employee-obligor will not generally delay the processing of a garnishment action. If the employee-obligor estab-lishes to the satisfaction of the em-ployee-obligor’s agency that the law of the jurisdiction which issued the legal process provides that the processing of the garnishment action shall be sus-pended during an appeal, and if the em-ployee-obligor establishes that he or she has filed an appeal, the employing agency shall comply with the applica-ble law of the jurisdiction and delay or suspend the processing of the garnish-ment action. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the employing agency shall not be required to establish an es-crow account to comply with the legal process even if the applicable law of the jurisdiction requires private em-ployers to do so. (d) Under the circumstances set forth in §582.305 (a) or (b), or where the agen-cy is directed by the Justice Depart-ment not to comply with the legal process, the agency shall respond di-rectly to the court, or other authority, setting forth its reasons for non-com-pliance with the legal process. In addi-tion, the agency shall inform the per-son who caused the legal process to be served, or the person’s representative, that the legal process', '1938, as amended. (b) Agencies may not include a COLA or post differential as part of an em-ployee’s rate of basic pay for the pur-pose of computing entitlements to overtime pay, retirement, life insur-ance, or any other additional pay, COLA, or post differential under title 5, United States Code. (c) Payment of a COLA or post dif- ferential is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 5335. § 591.240 How are agency and em- ployee representatives involved in the administration of the COLA and post differential programs? (a) OPM may establish a COLA Advi- sory Committee in each COLA survey area. The committees are composed of agency and employee representatives from the COLA survey area and one or more representatives from OPM. (b) To the extent practical, the COLA Advisory Committees coordinate and work with the Survey Implementation Committee established pursuant to Caraballo, et al. v. United States, No. 1997–0027 (D.V.I). § 591.241 What are the key activities of the COLA Advisory Committees? (a) The COLA Advisory Committees may— (1) Advise and assist OPM in planning living-cost surveys; (2) Provide or arrange for observers for data collection during living-cost surveys; (3) Advise and assist OPM in the re- view of survey data; (4) Advise OPM on its administration of the COLA program, including survey methodology; and (5) Assist OPM in disseminating in- formation to affected employees about the living-cost surveys and the COLA program. (b) The committees also may advise OPM on special situations or condi-tions, such as hurricanes and earth-quakes, as they relate to OPM’s au-thority under §591.223(b) to conduct in-terim surveys or implement some other change in response to conditions caused by a natural disaster or similar emergency. § 591.242 What is the tenure of a COLA Advisory Committee? OPM may establish a COLA Advisory Committee in each area prior to each living-cost survey conducted in that area. OPM will appoint committee members for 3-year renewable terms. To the extent practical, the committee will continue to exist between surveys, but OPM may periodically review with VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00833 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR824 5 CFR Ch.

A COLA Advisory Committee has up to 12 members composed of OPM rep-resentatives and other agency and em-ployee representatives, unless OPM de-termines that the committee should be larger. In determining the number of committee members, OPM considers the amount of work the committee is likely to be requested to do (based on the size and complexity of the local liv-ing-cost survey) and the availability of employee and agency representatives to participate as committee members. § 591.244 How does OPM select COLA Advisory Committee members? (a) In establishing a COLA Advisory Committee, OPM invites local agencies and employee organizations to nomi-nate committee members. OPM also in-vites COLA Defense Corporations and the local Federal Executive Board or Federal Executive Association each to nominate committee members. Subject to §591.243, OPM selects committee members from these nominations in a manner designed to achieve a balanced representation that is reflective of agencies and employee organizations in the area. In consultation with the com-mittee, OPM may select additional nominees to serve as alternates to the primary committee members. OPM designates not more than two OPM representatives to serve on each com-mittee. (b) Each Executive agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, must cooperate and re-lease appointed employees for com-mittee proceedings and activities un-less the agency can demonstrate that exceptional circumstances directly re-lated to accomplishing the mission of the employee’s work unit require his or her presence on the job. Executive agency employees serving as com-mittee members are considered to be on official assignment to an inter-agency function, rather than on leave, and are eligible to receive reimburse-ment for authorized travel expenses from their respective agencies.

The emergency leave transfer program is an important policy that allows federal employees to donate annual leave to colleagues facing medical emergencies, making this a substantive inquiry about a specific workplace benefit. 

The question demonstrates a genuine need for detailed information about the program's operational constraints. HR professionals would find this particularly useful for administering leave policies, while employees would benefit from understanding the specific rules governing leave donation. The topic directly relates to Title 5 regulations concerning federal employee leave and benefits.

The practicality is high because medical emergencies are real challenges that federal workers may face, and understanding the limitations of leave donation can be crucial for both potential donors and recipients. The question seeks to clarify the boundaries and conditions of this supportive program, which has direct implications for workplace support and employee welfare.

While not covering the most fundamental aspects of federal employment, this question addresses a nuanced but important policy area that shows a sophisticated understanding of federal employee benefits. It would be particularly valuable for those involved in leave administration or considering participating in the emergency leave transfer program."
" What limitations exist on an agency's ability to extend the termination date of a national emergency for annual leave restoration purposes?
"," Per §630.310(f)(2)(iv), an agency head may initially extend the termination deadline by 12 months, and can grant a maximum of two 12-month extensions in connection with any single national emergency. After these extensions, no further extensions are permitted unless §630.309 applies in the case of an extended exigency. The termination can also occur earlier if the President declares an end to the emergency, OPM deems it no longer an exigency, or the employee moves to a position not involving essential emergency services.","['annual leave within the time limit specified in §630.306.

(c) For any employee determined under paragraph (b) of this section to be covered under this section who for-feits annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) at the beginning of a leave year, the forfeited annual leave is deemed to have been scheduled in ad-vance for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) and §630.308. (d) With respect to annual leave for- feited under paragraph (c) of this sec-tion, the annual leave must be restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) subject to the following time limits: (1) A full-time employee must sched- ule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date fixed by the agency head (or designee) under paragraph (f)(2) of this section as the termination date of the exigency of the public business. The agency must extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess an-nual leave or any portion thereof.

The agency must extend this pe-riod by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 per-cent of the number of hours in the em-ployee’s scheduled annual tour of duty. (e) The time limits established under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this sec-tion for using restored annual leave ac-counts shall not apply for the entire period during which an employee’s services are determined by the agency to be essential for the response to the national emergency. When coverage under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this sec-tion ends due to the termination date of the exigency of the public business fixed by the agency under paragraph (f)(2), a new time limit will be estab-lished under paragraph (d) of this sec-tion for all annual leave restored to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). (f)(1) The agency head (or designee) must continually monitor the agency response to the national emergency and determine whether the services of individual employees or groups of em-ployees continue to be essential for the response to the emergency such that annual leave may not be scheduled ac-cording to the normal procedures de-scribed in §630.308(a).

In requesting administrative offset OPM, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor: (1) That the debtor owes the debt; (2) The amount and basis of the debt; and (3) That OPM has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations, and the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the debtor with due process. (c) Request for offset from a Federal agency: When administrative offset is authorized, any Federal creditor agen-cy may request OPM to make an ad-ministrative offset from any OPM funds that are due and payable to a creditor agency’s debtor. OPM shall initiate the requested administrative offset only upon: (1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency: (i) That the debtor owes the debt; (ii) The amount and basis of the debt; (iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of adminis-trative offset; and (iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset reg-ulations and with the applicable provi-sions of 4 CFR part 102, including pro-viding any required hearing or review.

OPM may make an administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by §§179.304 and 179.305 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize OPM’s ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the comple-tion of those procedures.

(a) The Military Personnel and Civil- ian Employees’ Claims Act of 1964, 31 U.S.C. 240 to 243, authorizes the Direc-tor, Office of Personnel Management to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of officers and employ-ees of OPM, amounting to not more than $15,000, for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Claims are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall determine to be reasonable, use- ful, or proper under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is reason-able, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the type and quantity of property involved, cir-cumstances attending acquistion and use of the property, and whether pos-session or use by the claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service. (b) The Government does not under- write all personal property losses that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be rea-sonable, useful, or proper. If individ-uals possess excessive quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property privately insured. § 180.102 Claimants. (a) The following are proper claim- ants: (1) Officers and employees of OPM; (2) Former officers and employees of OPM whose claims arose out of inci-dents which occurred before their sepa-ration; (3) The authorized agent or legal rep- resentative of persons in §§180.102(a)(1) and 180.102(a)(2); (4) Survivors of persons in §§180.102(a)(1) and 180.102(a)(2) in the following order of precedence: (i) Spouse, (ii) Children, (iii) Father or mother, or both, (iv) Brothers or sisters, or both. (b) A claim may not be presented by or for the benefit of a subrogee, as-signee, conditional vendor, or other third party. § 180.103 Time limitations. A claim must be presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues, except during war or armed conflict.

(b) Special schedules shall consist of a single wage rate for each training pe-riod. Wage rates shall be determined as follows: (1) Rates shall be based on the cur- rent second step rate of the target journeyman grade level on the regular nonsupervisory wage schedule for the area where the apprentice or trainee is employed. (2) The entrance rate shall be com- puted at 65 percent of the journeyman level, step 2, rate, or the WG–1, step 1, rate, whichever is greater. (3) When the WG–1, step 1, rate is used, the apprentice rate shall be in-creased by a minimum of 5 cents per hour for each succeeding increment in- terval until the rate obtained by this method equals the rate computed under the formula. No increase shall be less then 5 cents per hour. (c) Advancement to higher incre- ments shall be at 26-week intervals, re-gardless of the total length of the training period. Intermediate rates shall be established by subtracting the entrance rate from the journeyman level, step 2 rate, and dividing the dif-ference by the number of 26-week peri-ods of the particular training term. The resulting quotient equals the in-crement for each succeeding rate. (d) Agencies may hire at advanced rates or accelerate progression through scheduled wage rates if prescribed by approved agency training standards or programs. (e) If the employee is promoted to the target job or to a job at the same grade level, the promotion shall be to the second step rate. If the employee is as-signed to a job at a grade level that is less than the grade level of the target job, existing pay fixing rules shall be followed.

Office and agency employees whose official duties involve personnel records shall be sen-sitive to individual rights to personal privacy and shall not disclose informa-tion from any personnel record unless disclosure is part of their official du-ties or required by executive order, reg-ulation, or statute (e.g., required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552). (c) Improper uses of personnel informa- tion. Any Office or agency employee who makes a disclosure of personnel records knowing that such disclosure is unauthorized, or otherwise knowingly violates these regulations, shall be sub-ject to disciplinary action and may also be subject to criminal penalties where the records are subject to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Employees are prohibited from using personnel in-formation not available to the public, gained through official duties, for com- mercial solicitation or sale, or for per-sonal gain. Subpart B—Personnel Records Subject to the Privacy Act § 293.201 Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the criteria to be used to deter-mine when personnel records on indi-viduals are subject both to the regula-tions contained in this part and to Of-fice or agency regulations imple-menting the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. When personnel records are maintained within a system of records, the records are deemed to be within the scope of both the regulations in this part and Office or agency regulations implementing the Privacy Act. § 293.202 Records subject to Office or agency Privacy Act regulations. When the Office of Personnel Man- agement publishes in the F EDERAL REGISTER a notice of system of records for personnel records which are main-tained by the agencies or by the Office, that system of records will be subject to the regulations in this part and also VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR94 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 293.203 to the regulations in part 297 of this chapter. When agencies publish a no-tice of system of records for personnel records required by the Office that are not included in the Office’s notices, those agency systems of records will be subject both to the regulations con-tained in this part and to agency pro-mulgated regulations that implement the Privacy Act. § 293.203 Review of Office or agency practices. Reviews of agency personnel manage- ment policies and practices will be con-ducted to insure compliance with Of-fice regulations. The Office may direct agencies to take whatever corrective action is necessary. Office or agency officials who have knowledge of viola- tions of these regulations shall take whatever corrective action is nec-essary. Agencies shall list officials of the Office of Personnel Management as a routine user for personnel records to assist the Office in its oversight re-sponsibilities.

Except for those agencies specifically excluded from Office of Personnel Man-agement (OPM) recordkeeping require-ments by statute, OPM regulation, or formal agreement between OPM and the agency, this subpart applies to— and within this subpart agency means—each executive department and independent establishment of the Fed-eral Government; each corporation wholly owned or controlled by the United States; and, with respect to po-sitions subject to civil service rules and regulations, the legislative and ju-dicial branches of the Federal Govern-ment. OPM will list agencies to which this subpart does not apply in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, and will amend the Guide from time to time to update that list. [76 FR 52537, Aug. 23, 2011] § 293.302 Establishment of Official Per- sonnel Folder. Each agency shall establish an Offi- cial Personnel Folder (OPF) for each employee occupying a position subject to this part, except as provided in §293.306. Except as provided in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, there will be only one OPF maintained for each employee regardless of service in various agencies. [50 FR 3309, Jan. 24, 1985, as amended at 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001] § 293.303 The roles and responsibilities of the Office, agencies, and custodians. (a) The Official Personnel Folder (OPF) of each employee in a position subject to civil service rules and regu-lations and of each former employee who held such a position is part of the records of the Office of Personnel Man-agement (Office). (b) The Office has Government-wide responsibility for developing regula-tions, practices and procedures for the establishment, maintenance, and transfer of OPFs. (c) Agencies shall be responsible for the following: (1) The establishment of the OPF for a new appointee or a new employee for whom no OPF has previously been es-tablished; and (2) The maintenance of a previously existing OPF during the period any new appointee or employee remains an agency’s employee.

In the case of an electronic OPF (eOPF), the custodian is the agency that has pri-mary access to an eOPF contained within a document management', 'for level III of the Executive Schedule is preserved under a provision of this section, the SL or ST employee will continue to receive his or her current rate of basic pay and is not eligible for a pay increase until he or she is assigned to an SL or ST po-sition covered by a certified perform-ance appraisal system or his or her rate of basic pay is less than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. (f) An agency that is otherwise sub- ject to the limitation in §534.504(a)(2)(i) with respect to an SL or ST position occupied by an SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is authorized to be preserved under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section may set that employee’s rate of basic pay above EX– III only at the level required to pre- serve the applicable rate. (g) Preservation of a rate of basic pay under this section does not preclude a subsequent reduction in pay as pro-vided in §534.508. (h) The provisions of this section do not apply upon the appointment of a senior professional employee to a posi-tion in the Senior Executive Service or upon the appointment of a member of the Senior Executive Service to a sen-ior professional position. § 534.510 Off-cycle pay increases. (a) An authorized agency official may provide an off-cycle pay increase to a senior professional if, and only if, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in §430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency determines an off-cycle pay increase is warranted and approves the amount of the increase, subject to the requirements of this section and the agency’s written procedures estab-lished under §534.505. The authority to approve an off-cycle pay increase under this section may not be further dele-gated. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an off-cycle pay in-crease must be supported by factors that distinguish the level of the senior professional’s performance and/or con-tributions to agency performance from that of his or her peers, as applicable, and from that sufficiently rewarded through the annual pay adjustment. In assessing the warrant for an off-cycle pay increase, the approving official may consider such factors as— (1) A senior professional’s exception- ally meritorious accomplishments that contribute significantly to the agen-cy’s performance; (2) The need to offer a pay increase to reassign a senior professional to a posi-tion that has a substantially greater impact on agency performance; and (3) The need to retain a senior profes- sional whose contributions are critical to the agency and who is likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase.

This infor-mation may be derived from the agen-cy’s written pay procedures established under §534.505, agency performance management system activities, or other sources the agency deems useful for this purpose. (d) If the maximum rate of basic pay applicable to an agency’s senior profes-sionals increases during the 1 year pe-riod following the annual pay adjust-ment under §534.507(a)(1) for reasons other than a change in the certifi-cation status of an applicable perform-ance appraisal system, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifi-cations described in §430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency may con-sider whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be war-ranted for a senior professional based on the same criteria used in deter-mining his or her annual pay increase. However, if the increase in maximum rate of basic pay is due to a change in the certification status of an applica-ble performance appraisal system, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply. (e) An off-cycle pay increase granted under this section will be effective pro-spectively, not retroactively. § 534.511 Exemption from performance appraisal requirements. (a) An agency responsible for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for SL or ST employees or positions excluded from performance appraisal by or under statute is, with respect to those employees or positions, exempt from any provision of this subpart to the ex-tent that it makes a pay determination contingent upon performance ap-praisal, including— (1) Section 534.505(a)(1), (2) and (3) to the extent these paragraphs require that an agency’s plan for setting and increasing rates of basic pay reflect meaningful distinctions among SL and ST employees based upon individual performance and include criteria that ensure individuals with the highest lev-els of individual performance, or the greatest contributions to agency per-formance, or both, receive the highest pay increases. The agency must still provide written procedures for setting and adjusting rates of pay for covered SL and ST employees that specify cri-teria that will be applied consistent with applicable law. The remaining provisions of §534.505 apply, except for references in §534.505(a)(5) to compli-ance with certification requirements and centralized review of ratings and pay actions; (2) Section 534.507(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). The agency must still document in writing the basis for each pay increase under §534.507 in accordance with cri-teria specified in the agency’s written procedures under §534.505(a); and (3) Section 534.510(b) and (c). The agency must still document in writing the basis for each off-cycle pay in-crease under §534.510 in accordance with criteria specified in the agency’s written procedures under §534.505(a). (b) Except as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, an agency respon-sible for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for SL or ST employees ex-cluded from performance appraisal by or under statute is subject to the re-quirements of this subpart with respect to those employees. (c) The maximum rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee or position not subject to performance appraisal is the maximum rate described in §534.504(a)(2)(i). An agency head who uses the exemption in paragraph (a) of this section to set the rate of basic pay for SL or ST employees who are not subject to performance appraisal may not certify that those employees are covered by a performance appraisal system meeting the certification cri-teria established in part 430, subpart D of this chapter for purposes of author-izing rates of']",5,"The context provides extremely precise and detailed information about the limitations on extending the termination date of a national emergency, specifically noting that an agency head may extend the deadline annually by 12 months, but under no circumstances may more than two 12-month extensions be granted in connection with any national emergency.",4,"This question is highly relevant and practical for federal HR specialists, managers, and employees dealing with leave management during national emergencies. It addresses a specific regulatory nuance in Title 5 that has direct implications for annual leave policies and employee benefits. The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the complexities surrounding leave restoration during extraordinary circumstances.

The usefulness stems from several key factors:
1. Relevance: Directly relates to annual leave policies and emergency leave management
2. Practicality: Addresses a real procedural challenge that agencies and employees might encounter
3. Specificity: Focuses on a precise regulatory limitation, indicating a need for detailed policy interpretation
4. Applicability: Helps stakeholders understand the boundaries of leave restoration during national emergencies

HR professionals would find this particularly valuable for ensuring compliance with federal regulations, while employees would benefit from understanding their leave rights during extended emergency situations. The question suggests a nuanced exploration of how administrative policies intersect with emergency declarations, making it a sophisticated inquiry into federal employment regulations."
" Under what circumstances can an employee receive evacuation payments during a pandemic health crisis?
"," According to §550.409, an agency may order employees to evacuate from their worksite and perform work from home or an alternative mutually agreeable location during a pandemic health crisis. The agency can:
1. Designate the employee's home as a ""safe haven""
2. Provide evacuation payments
3. Assign the employee work considered necessary, regardless of their grade or title
4. Potentially grant special allowance payments to offset added expenses of working from home

The employee must have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform assigned work, and failure to do so may result in terminating evacuation payments or disciplinary action.","['the rates of pay, allowances, or differentials, if any, to which he or she would otherwise have been entitled under all applicable stat-utes other than section 5527 of title 5, United States Code. Any adjustments in the employee’s account shall also re-flect advance payments made to the employee under §550.403(a) of this sub-part. (c)(1) After an employee’s account is reviewed as required by paragraph (a) of this section, if it is found that the employee is indebted for any part of the advance payment made to him or her or his or her dependent(s) or des-ignated representative, recovery of the indebtedness shall be effected by the payroll office having jurisdiction over the employee’s account, unless a waiv-er of recovery has been approved. Re-payment of the indebtedness may be made either in full or in partial pay-ments, as determined by the head of the agency or designated official. (2) Recovery of indebtedness for ad- vance payment shall not be required when it is determined by the head of the agency or designated official that the recovery would be against equity or good conscience or against the pub-lic interest. Findings that formed the basis for waiver of recovery shall be filed in the employee’s personnel folder on the permanent side. (d) For the period or periods covered by any payments made under this sub-part, the employee shall be considered as performing active Federal service in his or her position without a break in service. § 550.409 Evacuation payments during a pandemic health crisis. (a) An agency may order one or more employees to evacuate from their worksite and perform work from their home (or an alternative location mutu-ally agreeable to the agency and the employee) during a pandemic health crisis without regard to whether the agency and the employee have a telework agreement in place at the time the order to evacuate is issued. Under these circumstances, an agency may designate the employee’s home (or an alternative location mutually agreeable to the agency and the em-ployee) as a safe haven and provide evacuation payments to the employee. An agency must compute the evacu-ation payments and determine the time period during which such pay-ments will be made in accordance with §550.404. An evacuated employee at a safe haven may be assigned to perform any work considered necessary or re-quired to be performed during the pe-riod of evacuation without regard to his or her grade, level, or title. The em-ployee must have the necessary knowl-edge and skills to perform the assigned work. Failure or refusal to perform as-signed work may be a basis for termi-nating evacuation payments, as well as disciplinary action. (b) The head of an agency, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may grant special allowance payments, based upon a case-by-case analysis, to offset the direct added expenses inci-dental to performing work from home (or an alternative location mutually agreeable to the agency and the em-ployee) during a pandemic health cri-sis. (c) An agency may terminate evacu- ation payments under the conditions listed in §550.407. An agency must make any necessary adjustments in pay consistent with §550.408 after the evacuation is terminated.

(a) An employee’s overtime entitle- ment under this subpart includes: (1) The straight time rate of pay times all overtime hours worked; plus (2) One-half times the employee’s hourly regular rate of pay times all overtime hours worked. (b) An employee’s ‘‘straight time rate of pay’’ is equal to the employee’s rate of pay for his or her position (exclusive of any premiums, differentials, or cash awards or bonuses) except for an em-ployee who is authorized annual pre-mium pay under §550.141 or §550.151 of this chapter. For an employee who is authorized annual premium pay, straight time rate of pay is equal to basic pay plus annual premium pay di-vided by the hours for which the basic pay plus annual premium pay are in- tended. (c) An employee has been paid in compliance with the overtime pay pro-visions of this subpart only if the em-ployee has received pay at a rate at least equal to the employee’s straight time rate of pay for all nonovertime hours of work in the workweek.

(a) When an employee earns a nondis- cretionary cash award or bonus (as op-posed to discretionary cash awards or bonuses as described in §551.511(b)(3)), the bonus must be taken into account in determining overtime pay for the pe-riod of time during which the bonus was earned. An agency may meet the overtime pay requirements for the bonus period by using one of the proce-dures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this sec-tion calculate the additional overtime pay the employee is due. The proce-dures in paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section describe methods where the overtime pay requirements are met in the calculation or distribu-tion of the bonus itself. (b) Individual computation methods — (1) Week-by-week recomputation method. The agency may compute the addi-tional overtime pay owed an employee by allocating the nondiscretionary bonus payable under the agency bonus plan to the weeks or hours during which it was earned and recomputing the employee’s total remuneration, VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00727 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR718 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 551.521 hourly regular rate, and overtime pay for each applicable workweek in the bonus period. (2) Bonus hourly rate method. The agency may assume that an equal amount of the nondiscretionary bonus applies to each hour worked during the bonus period and derive a bonus hourly rate by dividing the employee’s total bonus by the total number of hours worked by the employee during the bonus period. Then the agency may compute the employee’s additional overtime pay by multiplying one-half of that bonus hourly rate by the total number of overtime hours worked by the employee during the bonus period. (3) Percentage bonus method. An agen- cy may establish a nondiscretionary bonus as a fixed percentage of total pay (i.e., pre-bonus total remuneration, in- cluding straight time pay for any over-time hours, plus any half-rate overtime pay under §551.512(a)(2)) to be earned by the employee during a future period of service. This method may not be used to circumvent any bonus limita-tions that might otherwise apply. At the agency’s discretion, the portion of the bonus attributable to the employ-ee’s half-rate overtime pay under §551.512(a)(2) may be excluded in apply-ing bonus limitations, since it can be viewed as constituting additional FLSA overtime pay. (This method does not apply to nondiscretionary bonuses established as a percentage of a seg-ment of pay, such as ratings-based cash awards under §451.104(g) of this chapter that are expressed as a percentage of basic pay, excluding locality adjust-ments. To meet overtime pay require-ments for these types of bonuses, use one of the methods described in para-graphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.) (c) Group-based bonus distribution methods.

An agency may add regulatory information at a ‘‘[Reserved]’’ loca-tion at any time. Occasionally ‘‘[Reserved]’’ is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regu-lations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published else-where. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the mate-rial is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material pub- lished in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uni- formity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorpora-tion by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

This subpart contains the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management which implement the above sections of chapter 34 (as set out in §340.101). § 340.202 General. (a) Definitions. Part-time career em- ployment means regularly scheduled work of from 16 to 32 hours per week performed by an employee of an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3401 (a) through (f), who has an appointment in tenure group I or II and who becomes em-ployed on such part-time basis on or after April 8, 1979. Tenure group I applies to employees in the competitive service under career appointments who are not serving pro-bation and permanent employees in the excepted service whose appointments carry no restrictions or conditions. Tenure group II applies to employees in the competitive service serving pro-bation, career-conditional employees, and career employees in obligated posi-tions. It also includes employees in the excepted service serving trial periods, whose tenure is indefinite solely be-cause they occupy obligated positions; or whose tenure is equivalent to ca-reer-conditional in the competitive service. (b) Agency Exceptions. As an excep- tion to the general definition of part- time employment in §340.202(a) and under the authority provided in 5 U.S.C. 3402(a)(3), an agency may permit an employee who has an appointment in tenure group I or II to perform regu-larly scheduled work of from 1 to 15 hours per week.

It addresses a specific policy area within Title 5 related to employee protections and compensation during extraordinary circumstances. The question demonstrates a genuine need for understanding evacuation payment protocols, which could be critical for employees facing potential health risks or mandatory relocation during a public health emergency. Such information is crucial for both employees seeking to understand their entitlements and managers responsible for implementing emergency response procedures. While the question is somewhat narrow in scope, it represents an important aspect of federal employment policy that has significant real-world applicability, especially in light of recent global health challenges. HR professionals would find this particularly useful for developing clear guidance and ensuring proper implementation of evacuation and compensation policies during crisis situations."

Subpart A—General Provisions SOURCE : 72 FR 52762, Sept. 17, 2007, unless otherwise noted. § 551.101 General. (a) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (referred to as ‘‘the Act’’ or ‘‘FLSA’’), provides minimum standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and administrative pro-cedures by which covered worktime must be compensated. Included in the Act are provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-portal activities. In addition, the Act exempts specified employees or groups of em-ployees from the application of certain of its provisions and prescribes pen-alties for the commission of specifi-cally prohibited acts. (b) This part contains the regula- tions, criteria, and conditions set forth by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as prescribed by the Act, supple-ments and implements the Act, and must be read in conjunction with it. (c) OPM’s administration of the Act must comply with the terms of the Act but the law does not require OPM’s regulations to mirror the Department of Labor’s FLSA regulations. OPM’s administration of the Act must be con-sistent with the Department of Labor’s administration of the Act only to the extent practicable and only to the ex-tent that this consistency is required to maintain compliance with the terms of the Act. For example, while OPM’s executive, administrative, and profes-sional exemption criteria are con-sistent with the Department of Labor’s exemption criteria, OPM does not apply the highly compensated em-ployee criteria in 29 CFR 541.601 to de-termine FLSA exemption status. § 551.102 Authority and administra- tion. Section 3(e)(2) of the Act authorizes the application of the provisions of the Act to any person employed by the Government of the United States, as specified in that section. (a) Office of Personnel Management. Section 4(f) of the Act authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to administer the provisions of the Act. OPM is the administrator of the provi-sions of the Act with respect to any person employed by an agency, except as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (b) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administers the equal pay provisions contained in section 6(d) of the Act. (c) The Department of Labor admin- isters the Act for the government of the District of Columbia and the fol-lowing United States Government enti-ties: (1) The Library of Congress; (2) The United States Postal Service; (3) The Postal Rate Commission; and (4) The Tennessee Valley Authority. (d) Office of Compliance. The Congres- sional Accountability Act of 1995, as amended, sections 1301 et seq. of title 2, United States Code, extends rights and protections of the FLSA to employees of the following United States Govern-ment entities, and assigns certain ad-ministrative responsibilities to the Of-fice of Compliance: (1) The United States House of Rep- resentatives; (2) The United States Senate; (3) The Capitol Guide Service; (4) The Capitol Police; (5) The Congressional Budget Office; (6) The Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (7) The Office of the Attending Physi- cian; and (8) The Office of Compliance. § 551.103 Coverage.

(b) Not covered. The following persons are not covered by the Act: (1) A person appointed under appro- priate authority without compensa-tion; (2) A trainee; (3) A volunteer; or (4) A member of the Uniformed Serv- ices. § 551.104 Definitions. In this part— Act or FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq. ). Administrative employee means an em- ployee who meets the administrative exemption criteria in §551.206. Agency means any instrumentality of the United States Government, or any constituent element thereof acting di-rectly or indirectly as an employer, as this term is defined in section 3(d) of the Act and in this section, but does not include the entities of the United States Government listed in §551.102(c) for which the Department of Labor ad-ministers the Act or §551.102(d)(1) through (8), whose employees are cov-ered by the Congressional Account-ability Act of 1995, as amended, which makes applicable the rights and pro-tections of the FLSA and assigns cer-tain administrative responsibilities to the Office of Compliance. Claim means a written allegation re- garding a current or former employee concerning the employee’s FLSA ex-emption status determination or enti-tlement to minimum wage or overtime pay for work performed under the Act. The term claim is used generically in subpart G and includes complaints under the child labor provisions of the Act. Claim period means the time during which the cause or basis of the claim occurred. Claimant means any party who files an FLSA claim. Customarily and regularly means a fre- quency which must be greater than oc-casional but which may be less than constant. Tasks or work performed customarily and regularly includes work normally and recurrently per-formed every workweek. It does not in-clude isolated or one-time tasks. Directly and closely related means work that is directly and closely re-lated to the performance of exempt work which is also considered exempt work. The phrase directly and closely re- lated means tasks that are related to exempt duties and that contribute to or facilitate performance of exempt work. Directly and closely related work may include typically nonexempt tasks that arise out of and are integral to ex-empt duties. Those nonexempt tasks must be performed by the exempt em-ployee to perform his or her exempt work. Work directly and closely related to the performance of exempt duties may also include recordkeeping; main-taining various records pertaining to workload or employee performance; monitoring and adjusting machinery; taking notes; using the computer to create documents or presentations; opening the mail for the purpose of reading it and making decisions; and using a photocopier or fax machine.

(2) Annual leave credited to an em- ployee that is in excess of 90 days (720 hours) shall be subject to reduction in the same manner as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the employee’s ac-cumulated annual leave is equal to or less than 90 days (720 hours). For the 1994 leave year, 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) shall be applied only for leave earned and used between the start of the first pay pe-riod beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year. (i) Agencies shall notify affected em- ployees and maintain records on the accumulated annual leave credited to each employee under paragraph (h) of this section and on any reductions in the credited annual leave made under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c).

(2) Time spent in training outside regular working hours shall be consid-ered hours of work if: (i) The employee is directed to par- ticipate in the training by his or her employing agency; and (ii) The purpose of the training is to improve the employee’s performance of the duties and responsibilities of his or her current position. (3) Time spent in apprenticeship or other entry level training, or intern-ship or other career related work study training, or training under the Vet-erans Recruitment Act (5 CFR part 307) outside regular working hours shall not be considered hours of work, pro-vided no productive work is performed during such periods, except as provided by §410.402(b) of this chapter and para-graphs (f) and (g) of §551.401. (4) Time spent by an employee per- forming work for the agency during a period of training shall be considered hours of work. (b) The following phrases contained in paragraph (a) of this section, are fur-ther clarified: (1) Directed to participate means that the training is required by the agency and the employee’s performance or continued retention in his or her cur-rent position will be adversely affected by nonenrollment in such training. The fact that an agency pays for all or part of the expenses of training does not create an entitlement to overtime hours of work unless participation in the training is directed by the agency. (2) Training ‘‘to improve the employ- ee’s performance * * * of his or her cur-rent position’’ is distinguished from upward mobility training or develop- mental training to provide an em-ployee the knowledge or skills needed for a subsequent position in the same career field. (c) Time spent by an employee within an agency’s allowance of preparatory time for attendance at training shall be considered hours of work if such pre-paratory time is: (1) During an employee’s regular working hours; or (2) Outside the employee’s regular working hours, and the purpose of the training meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (d) Time spent attending a lecture, meeting, or conference shall be consid-ered hours of work if attendance is: (1) During an employee’s regular working hours; or (2) Outside an employee’s regular working hours, and (i) The employee is directed by an agency to attend such an event; or (ii) The employee performs work for the benefit of the agency during such attendance.

(b) Time spent taking a physical ex- amination that is required for the em-ployee’s continued employment with the agency shall be considered hours of work. § 551.426 Time spent in charitable ac- tivities. Time spent working for public or charitable purposes at an agency’s re-quest, or under an agency’s direction or control, shall be considered hours of work. However, time spent voluntarily in such activities outside an employ-ee’s regular working hours is not hours of work. S PECIAL SITUATIONS § 551.431 Time spent on standby duty or in an on-call status. (a)(1) An employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-related reasons, the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty and is as-signed to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employee’s activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effectively for his or her own purposes. A finding that an employee’s activities are substantially limited may not be based on the fact that an employee is subject to restrictions necessary to en-sure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and respon-sibilities, such as restrictions on alco-hol consumption or use of certain medications. (2) An employee is not considered re- stricted for ‘‘work-related reasons’’ if, for example, the employee remains at the post of duty voluntarily, or if the restriction is a natural result of geo-graphic isolation or the fact that the employee resides on the agency’s prem-ises. For example, in the case of an em-ployee assigned to work in a remote wildland area or on a ship, the fact that the employee has limited mobility when relieved from duty would not be a basis for finding that the employee is restricted for work-related reasons. (b) An employee will be considered off duty and time spent in an on-call status shall not be considered hours of work if: (1) The employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or to carry an elec-tronic device', 'of the employ-ee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek and failed to do so in accord-ance with paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, the employee shall be en-titled to the payment of premium pay for that period of work as regularly scheduled work under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter. In this regard, it must be determined that the head of the agency: (i) Had knowledge of the specific days and hours of the work re-quirement in advance of the adminis-trative workweek, and (ii) had the op-portunity to determine which em-ployee had to be scheduled, or resched-uled, to meet the specific days and hours of that work requirement.

(a) Notwithstanding §610.121, the head of an agency may authorize a spe-cial tour of duty of not less than 40 hours to permit an employee to take one or more courses in a college, uni-versity, or other educational institu- tion when it is determined that: (1) The courses being taken are not training under chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code; (2) The rearrangement of the employ- ee’s tour of duty will not appreciably interfere with the accomplishment of the work required to be performed; (3) Additional costs for personal serv- ices will not be incurred; and (4) Completion of the courses will equip the employee for more effective work in the agency. (b) The agency may not pay to the employee any premium pay solely be-cause the special tour of duty author-ized under this section causes the em-ployee to work on a day, or at a time during the day, for which premium pay would otherwise be payable. (c) OPM may from time to time re- quest an agency to report on the use of this authority. § 610.123 Travel on official time. Insofar as practicable travel during nonduty hours shall not be required of an employee. When it is essential that this be required and the employee may not be paid overtime under §550.112(e) of this chapter the official concerned shall record his reasons for ordering travel at those hours and shall, upon request, furnish a copy of his state-ment to the employee concerned.

For purposes of pay and leave, the day to be treated as a holiday is deter-mined as follows: (a) Except when employees are enti- tled to a different holiday under 5 U.S.C. 6103(b)(3), an employee’s holiday is the day designated by 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) whenever part of the employee’s basic workweek (as defined in §610.102) or basic work requirement (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3)) is scheduled on that day. (b) When a holiday falls on a non- workday outside an employee’s basic workweek, the day to be treated as his or her holiday is determined in accord-ance with sections 6103 (b) and (d) of title 5, United States Code, and Execu-tive Order 11582. (c) When an agency determines the holiday in accordance with section 6103(d) of title 5, United States Code, for an employee under a compressed work schedule, the agency shall select a workday for the holiday that is in the same biweekly pay period as the date of the actual holiday designated under 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) or in the bi-weekly pay period immediately pre-ceding or following that pay period.

The purpose of this subpart is to pro- vide uniform and equitable standards under which regular employees paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates may be relieved from duty with pay by ad-ministrative order. § 610.302 Policy statement. The authority in this subpart may be used only to the extent warranted by good administration for short periods of time not generally exceeding 3 con-secutive work days in a single period of excused absence. This authority may not be used in situations of extensive duration or for periods of interrupted or suspended operations such as ordi-narily would be covered by the sched-uling of leave, furlough, or the assign-ment of other work. Insofar as prac-ticable, each administrative order issued under this subpart shall provide benefits for regular employees paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates simi-lar to those provided for employees paid at annual rates. § 610.303 Definitions. In this subpart: Administrative order means an order issued by an authorized official of an agency relieving regular employees from active duty without charge to leave or loss of pay. Regular employees means employees paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates who have a regular tour of duty, and whose appointments are not lim-ited to 90 days or less or who have been currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under one or more ap-pointments without a break in service.

This subpart applies to regular em- ployees of the Federal Government paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates. This subpart does not apply to experts and consultants. § 610.305 Standards. An administrative order may be issued']",4,"The context provides comprehensive details about FLSA coverage in section 551.103, which clearly outlines which employees are covered (those defined as employees under 5 U.S.C. 2105, civilian employees appointed under appropriate authority, and those suffered or permitted to work by an agency) and which are not covered (unpaid appointees, trainees, volunteers, and Uniformed Services members), making it possible to answer the question with substantial detail.",4,"This question is highly relevant and practical for multiple stakeholders in federal employment. It addresses a critical aspect of labor regulations that impacts employee classification, compensation, and rights. HR specialists would find this information essential for proper employee categorization and compliance. Managers need to understand FLSA coverage to ensure correct pay practices and overtime regulations. Federal employees would benefit from knowing their classification and associated rights. The question demonstrates a substantive information need about an important regulatory framework that governs employment practices in the federal government. While not extremely complex, it seeks fundamental knowledge that has direct implications for workplace policies and employee compensation. The query is technically phrased but clearly seeks actionable information about OPM's interpretation of FLSA coverage, making it a valuable resource for understanding federal employment regulations."
" If an employee disagrees with a classification decision that results in a lower grade, what appeal rights do they have?
"," Per § 511.602, when an employee's position is reclassified to a lower grade, they are entitled to:
1. A prompt written notice from the agency explaining the reclassification
2. Information about their right to appeal the decision, which can be:
   - To the agency (if they have an established appeal system)
   - To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
3. Time limits for filing an appeal to preserve potential retroactive benefits
4. Information about any other appeal or grievance rights under applicable laws, rules, regulations, or negotiated agreements

The policy also notes in § 511.603(a) that an employee can request an OPM decision on the appropriate occupational series, grade, or inclusion/exclusion of their position from the General Schedule.","['Position Classification Actions or Decisions 511.701 Effective dates generally. 511.702 Agency or Office classification ap- peal decisions. 511.703 Retroactive effective date.

(a) When an employee who received a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 5551 is reemployed in the Fed-eral service prior to the end of the pe-riod covered by the lump-sum pay-ment, the employee must refund to the employing agency an amount equal to the pay included in the lump-sum pay-ment under §550.1205(b) that covers the period between the date of reemploy-ment and the expiration of the lump- sum leave period, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The agency must compute the refund based on the pay used to compute the lump-sum payment under §550.1205(b). However, annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) that was included in a lump-sum payment is not subject to re-fund if an agency reemploys the em-ployee prior to the expiration of the lump-sum leave period. The agency must subtract such restored annual leave from the lump-sum leave period before calculating the refund. An agen-cy may permit an employee to refund the lump-sum payment for annual leave in installments, but may not waive collection. If an agency permits the lump-sum refund to be paid in in-stallments, the employee must refund the lump-sum payment in full within 1 year after the date of reemployment. (b) An employee who is reemployed in a position listed in 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(ii), (iii), (vi), or (vii) is not re-quired to refund a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section. (c) An employee who is reemployed in a position that has no leave system to which annual leave can be recredited is not required to refund a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section, except that individuals reem-ployed as Presidential appointees must refund a lump-sum payment and the annual leave will be held in abeyance, as provided in §550.1207(e).

(a) When an employee pays a full re- fund to an agency under §550.1206(a), the agency must recredit to the em-ployee an amount of annual leave equal to the days or hours of work (including holidays) remaining between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum period. The recredited annual leave is available for use by the employee on and after the date the an-nual leave is recredited. The agency must recredit annual leave as follows: (1) When an employee is reemployed in the Federal service in a position covered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, the employ-ing agency must recredit an amount of annual leave equal to the days or hours of work (including holidays) remaining between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum period. (2) When an employee is reemployed in the Federal service in a position that is not covered by subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, but is covered by a different leave system, the employing agency must recredit to the employee an amount of annual leave representing the days or hours of work (including holidays) remaining between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum period, as determined under §630.501(b) of this chapter. If the unexpired period of leave covers a larg-er amount of leave than can be recred-ited under the different leave system, the employee must refund only the amount that represents the leave that can be recredited. (3) When an employee is reemployed prior to the expiration of the lump-sum leave period, the agency may not re-credit to the employee the annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) that was included in a lump-sum pay-ment. The agency must subtract such restored annual leave from the lump- sum leave period before it determines the amount of annual leave to recredit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (b) Any annual leave the agency re- credits to the employee under para-graph (a) of this section is subject at the beginning of the next leave year to the maximum annual leave limitation established by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), (c), or (f), as appropriate, for the position in which the employee is reemployed, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. (c) If the amount of annual leave to be recredited under paragraph (a) of this section is more than the maximum annual leave limitation for the posi-tion in which reemployed, and the em-ployee’s former maximum annual leave limitation was established under 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), (c), or (f), as appro- priate, the agency must establish the employee’s new maximum annual leave limitation on the date of reemploy-ment as a personal leave ceiling equal to the amount of annual leave to be re-credited under paragraph (a) of this section. The new maximum annual leave', 'weekly regular tour of duty gen-erally consisting of five 10-hour work-days (an 8-hour basic workday and 2 regularly scheduled overtime hours); (2) The agent’s 8-hour basic workday (regular time) may be interrupted by an unpaid off-duty meal break; (3) The obligation to perform 2 hours of overtime work on a day including part of the agent’s regular tour of duty does not apply if the agent performs no work during regular time on that day, subject to paragraph (e) of this section; (4) As compensation for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the regular tour of duty, the agent is enti-tled to an overtime supplement equal to 25 percent of the agent’s hourly rate of basic pay times the number of paid hours of regular time for the agent in the pay period (subject to the premium cap in §§550.105 and 550.107 and the re-striction in §550.1626(a)(5)), and no ad-ditional compensation or compen-satory time off may be provided for such overtime hours; (5) For any additional regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty, the agent is enti-tled to overtime pay as provided in §550.1624, except as otherwise provided by §550.1626; (6) For any irregular overtime hours, the agent is entitled to be credited with compensatory time off as provided in §550.1625, except as otherwise pro-vided by §550.1626; (7) The agent must be charged cor- responding amounts of paid leave, com-pensatory time off, other paid time off, or time in nonpay status for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent from duty during regular time, as pro-vided in §550.1634, except as otherwise provided in §550.1626(a); and (8) If the agent is absent during regu- larly scheduled overtime hours within the agent’s regular tour of duty that the agent is obligated to work, the agent accrues an obligation to perform other overtime work for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent, and such obligation must be satisfied as provided in §550.1626.

For an agent with a Level 2 regular tour of duty and a 12.5 percent overtime sup-plement, the following rules apply: (1) The agent has an officially estab- lished weekly regular tour of duty gen-erally consisting of five 9-hour work-days (an 8-hour basic workday and 1 regularly scheduled overtime hour); (2) The agent’s 8-hour basic workday (regular time) may be interrupted by an unpaid off-duty meal break; (3) The obligation to perform 1 hour of overtime work on a day including part of the agent’s regular tour of duty does not apply if the agent performs no work during regular time on that day, subject to paragraph (e) of this section; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00692 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR683 Office of Personnel Management § 550.1622 (4) As compensation for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the regular tour of duty, the agent receives an overtime supplement equal to 12.5 percent of the agent’s hourly rate of basic pay times the number of paid hours of regular time for the agent in the pay period (subject to the premium cap in §§550.105 and 550.107 and the re-striction in §550.1626(a)(5)), and no ad-ditional compensation or compen-satory time off may be provided for such overtime hours; (5) For any additional regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty, the agent is enti-tled to overtime pay as provided in §550.1624, except as otherwise provided by §550.1626; (6) For any irregular overtime hours, the agent is entitled to be credited with compensatory time off as provided in §550.1625, except as otherwise pro-vided by §550.1626; (7) The agent must be charged cor- responding amounts of paid leave, com-pensatory time off, other paid time off, or time in nonpay status for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent from duty during regular time, as pro- vided in §550.1634, except as otherwise provided in §550.1626(a); and (8) If the agent is absent during regu- larly scheduled overtime hours within the agent’s regular tour of duty that the agent is obligated to work, the agent accrues an obligation to perform other overtime work for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent, and such obligation must be satisfied as provided in §550.1626. (c) Basic regular tour of duty.

(d) Effect of premium pay cap. If a pre- mium pay cap established under 5 U.S.C. 5547 and §§550.105 and 550.107 lim-its payment of an overtime supplement or regularly scheduled overtime pay, or limits crediting of compensatory time off, the affected agent is still required to perform assigned overtime work. (e) Meaning of ‘‘work’’. In applying paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this sec-tion, the term ‘‘work’’ refers to paid hours of work, consistent with §550.112, except that paid leave and other paid time off when an agent is excused from duty are not considered to be work hours. Official time under 5 U.S.C. 7131 during regular time is considered to be paid hours of ‘‘work’’ during the time an employee otherwise would be in a duty status. (f) Approval of absences. Any absence during obligated overtime hours (as de-scribed in paragraphs (a)(8) and (b)(8) of this section) is subject to management approval under CBP policies. § 550.1622 Circumstances requiring special treatment.

However, an employee who merely assists the manager of a particular de-partment and supervises two or more employees only in the actual man-ager’s absence does not meet this re-quirement. In addition, hours worked by an employee cannot be credited more than once for different execu-tives. This takes into consideration those organizations that use matrix management, i.e., a system of ‘‘shared’’ leadership, where supervision cuts across product and service lines in terms of accessing activities and advis-ing top management on business oper-ations, but where the supervisor/leader does not have the operating authority over all employees. Thus, a shared re-sponsibility for the supervision of the same two employees in the same recog-nized organizational unit does not sat-isfy this requirement. However, a full- time employee who works 4 hours for one supervisor and 4 hours for a dif-ferent supervisor will be credited as a half-time employee for both super-visors; and (2) Has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion, or any other change of status of other employ-ees, are given particular weight.

Generally, an ex-ecutive’s suggestions and recommenda-tions must pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and regu-larly directs. Particular weight does not include consideration of an occa-sional suggestion with regard to the change in status of a co-worker. An employee’s suggestions and rec-ommendations may still be deemed to have particular weight even if a higher level manager’s recommendation has more importance and even if the em-ployee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee’s change in status. § 551.206 Administrative exemption criteria. An administrative employee is an em- ployee whose primary duty is the per-formance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations, as distin-guished from production functions, of the employer or the employer’s cus-tomers and whose primary duty in-cludes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. (a) In general, the exercise of discre- tion and independent judgment in-volves the comparison and the evalua-tion of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been consid-ered. The term ‘‘matters of signifi-cance’’ refers to the level of impor-tance or consequence of the work per-formed. (b) The phrase discretion and inde- pendent judgment must be applied in light of all the facts involved in the particular employment situation in which the question arises. Factors to consider when determining whether an employee exercises discretion and inde-pendent judgment with respect to mat-ters of significance include, but are not limited to, whether the employee: (1) Has authority to formulate, af- fect, interpret, or implement manage-ment policies or operating practices; (2) Carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the orga-nization; (3) Performs work that affects the or- ganization’s operations to a substan-tial degree, even if the employee’s as-signments are related to operation of a particular segment of the organization; (4) Has authority to commit the em- ployer in matters that have significant financial impact; (5) Has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and proce-dures without prior approval; (6) Has authority to negotiate and bind the organization on significant matters; (7) Provides consultation or expert advice to management; (8) Is involved in planning long- or short-term organizational objectives; (9) Investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of manage-ment; and (10) Represents the organization in handling complaints, arbitrating dis-putes, or resolving grievances. (c) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from imme-diate direction or supervision. How-ever, an employee can exercise discre-tion and independent judgment even if the employee’s decisions or rec-ommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the term discretion and independent judgment does not require that decisions made by an employee have a finality that goes with unlim-ited authority and a complete absence of review. The decisions made as a re-sult of the exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action. The fact that an employee’s decision may be subject to review and that upon oc-casion the decisions are revised or re-versed after review does not mean that the employee is not exercising discre-tion and independent judgment.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 551.206 similar work. The fact that many em- ployees perform identical work or work of the same relative importance does not mean that the work of each such employee does not involve the exercise of discretion and independent judg-ment with respect to matters of signifi-cance. (e) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of skill in applying well- established techniques, procedures, or specific standards described in manuals or other sources. (f) The use of manuals, guidelines, or other established procedures con-taining or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial, or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption. Such manuals and proce-dures provide guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such reference material would not affect an employee’s exemp-tion status. However, employees who simply apply well-established tech-niques or procedures described in manuals or other sources within close-ly prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances will be nonexempt. (g) An employee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because the employer will expe-rience financial losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly.

Classification decisions can significantly impact an employee's pay, career progression, and job responsibilities, so understanding appeal mechanisms is crucial. The question is relevant to multiple stakeholders:

1. For employees: It provides insight into their procedural rights when they believe their job has been incorrectly classified or downgraded.
2. For HR specialists: It highlights the importance of understanding appeal processes and ensuring fair classification procedures.
3. For managers: It underscores the need for transparent and defensible classification decisions.

The question touches on key administrative procedures within federal employment, specifically addressing how employees can challenge administrative decisions that directly affect their professional status. It demonstrates a genuine need for information about rights, procedures, and potential recourse in the federal workplace. The query is precise, focused, and seeks substantive information about a real-world employment challenge that could have significant professional and financial implications for federal workers."

(a) For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), 2672, and 2675, a claim is deemed to have been presented when OPM receives from a claimant, his or her authorized agent or legal rep-resentative, an executed Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury or Death), or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages stating a sum cer-tain (a specific dollar amount) for in-jury to or loss of property, personal in-jury, or death alleged to have occurred as a result of the incident. (b) All claims filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act as a result of the al-leged negligence or wrongdoing of OPM or its employees will be mailed or de-livered to the Office of the General Counsel, United States Office of Per-sonnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415–1300. (c) A claim must be presented to the Federal agency whose activities gave rise to the claim. A claim that should have been presented to OPM, but was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is presented to OPM, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), as of the date the claim is received by OPM. When a claim is mistakenly pre-sented to OPM, OPM will transfer the claim to the appropriate Federal agen-cy, if ascertainable, and advise the claimant of the transfer, or return the claim to the claimant. (d) A claimant whose claim arises from an incident involving OPM and one or more other Federal agencies, will identify each agency to which the claim has been submitted at the time the claim is presented to OPM. OPM will contact all other affected Federal agencies in order to designate the sin-gle agency that will investigate and de-cide the merits of the claim. In the event a designation cannot be agreed upon by the affected agencies, the De-partment of Justice will be consulted and will designate an agency to inves-tigate and determine the merits of the claim. The designated agency will no-tify the claimant that all future cor-respondence concerning the claim must be directed to that Federal agency. All involved Federal agencies may agree to conduct their own administrative re-views and to coordinate the results, or to have the investigation conducted by the designated Federal agency. But, in either event, the designated agency will be responsible for the final deter-mination of the claim. (e) A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant’s option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). Amend-ments must be in writing and signed by the claimant or his or her authorized agent or legal representative. Upon timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, OPM will have 6 months in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and claimant’s option under 28 U.S.C. 2675 (a) will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of an amendment. § 177.103 Administrative claim; who may file. (a) A claim for injury to or loss of property may be presented by the owner of the property, his or her au-thorized agent or legal representative. (b) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured person, his or her authorized agent or legal rep-resentative. (c) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or adminis-trator of the decedent’s estate or by any other person legally entitled to as-sert a claim under the applicable State law. (d) A claim for loss totally com- pensated by an insurer with the rights to subrogate may be presented by the insurer. A claim for loss partially com-pensated by an insurer with the rights to subrogate may be presented by the insurer or the insured individually, as their respective interests appear, or jointly. When an insurer presents a claim asserting the rights to sub-rogate, he or she will present with the claim appropriate evidence that he or she has the rights to subrogate.

(2) When an acceptable level of com- petence determination has been waived and a within-grade increase granted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, there shall be a presumption that the employee would have performed at an acceptable level of competence had the employee performed the duties of his or her position of record for the min-imum period under the applicable agency performance appraisal program. (e) Notice of determination. (1) A level of competence determination shall be communicated to an employee in writ-ing as soon as possible after completion of the waiting period or other period upon which it was based.

(c) An agency may disallow as an em- ployee’s personal representative an in-dividual whose activities as a rep-resentative would cause a conflict of interest of position, an employee whose release from his or her official duties and responsibilities would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or an employee whose priority work as-signment precludes his or her release from official duties and responsibil-ities.

1. Peace Corps employees considering federal career transitions
2. HR specialists managing special hiring authorities
3. Federal agencies looking to recruit experienced international service professionals

The question touches on an important noncompetitive hiring provision that represents a specific benefit for individuals who have served in the Peace Corps. It demonstrates a nuanced understanding of federal employment regulations under Title 5, which often includes special hiring provisions for certain categories of public service workers.

The information would be particularly useful for:
- Career counselors advising Peace Corps alumni
- HR professionals implementing special hiring authorities
- Former Peace Corps staff exploring federal employment opportunities

While not universally applicable to all federal employees, the question addresses a specific but meaningful employment pathway that could be critically important to a targeted group of professionals. The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for precise regulatory information about federal hiring processes."
 What are the key requirements for an employee to use paid parental leave?," According to §630.1705, an employee must agree in writing before taking leave that they will work for their employing agency for at least 12 weeks after the leave concludes. If the employee fails to complete this work obligation, the agency may require reimbursement of government health insurance contributions, unless the failure is due to a serious health condition of the employee or child, or circumstances beyond the employee's control.","['to receiving any re-quested documentation or certification under this paragraph (h) based on an employee’s communications with a su-pervisor or management. Under these circumstances, the granting of paid pa-rental leave is considered to be provi-sional, pending receipt of the requested documentation or certification. (5) If the employee fails to provide the agency with the required docu-mentation or certification within the specified time period, the agency may determine that the employee is not en-titled to paid parental leave and may— (i) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off, as ap-propriate; or (ii) If the employee acted fraudu- lently, charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL) and pursue any other appropriate action. § 630.1704 Pay during leave. (a) The pay an employee receives when using paid parental leave shall be the same pay the employee would re-ceive if the employee were using an-nual leave. (b) Paid parental leave is a type of leave that is counted in applying the 8- hour rule in 5 CFR 550.122(b) that deter-mines whether night pay is payable during periods of leave. (c) The pay received during paid pa- rental leave may not include Sunday premium pay. (See section 624 of the Treasury and General Government Ap-propriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. 105–277, div. A, §101(h), 112 Stat. 2681–518 (Oct. 21, 1998).) § 630.1705 Work obligation. (a) Advance agreement. An employee may not use paid parental leave in con-nection with a birth or placement un-less the employee agrees (in writing), before the commencement of such leave, to work for the applicable em-ploying agency for not less than 12 weeks beginning on the employee’s first scheduled workday after such leave concludes. (See special rules gov-erning cases of incapacitation in §630.1706.) (b) Interpretation. For the purpose of applying paragraph (a) of this section— (1) The term ‘‘in writing’’ means an agreement with the employee’s hand-written signature or an acceptable electronic signature, consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR 850.106, and also is deemed to include an agreement documented in an email or text mes-sage from the employee, as long as the employee, within 24 hours, supplies the required signature; (2) The term ‘‘work’’ means a period during which the employee is in duty status, excluding any periods (paid or unpaid) of leave, time off (including holiday time off), or other nonduty sta-tus (including furlough or AWOL sta-tus). Such excluded periods will not count toward completion of the 12- week work obligation. (3) The term ‘‘applicable employing agency’’ means the agency employing the employee at the time use of paid parental leave concludes; and (4) The date paid parental leave con- cludes is— (i) The workday on which an em- ployee finishes using 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave dur-ing the 12-month period that began on the date of birth or placement; or (ii) If the employee does not use 12 administrative workweeks of paid pa-rental leave during the 12-month period that began on the date of birth or placement, the day that is the last workday on which an employee used paid parental leave. (c) Conversion of weeks to hours. For employees who are charged leave on an hourly basis (including fractions of an hour), the 12-week work obligation must be converted to hours based on the number of hours in the employee’s scheduled tour of duty, consistent with the rules in §630.1703(c). If an employ-ee’s scheduled tour of duty changes be-fore the employee completes the 12- week obligation, the agency must re-calculate the balance of work hours owed, consistent with the rules in §630.1703(e). An acceptable alternative approach is to express each period of work as a fraction or percentage of the average weekly scheduled tour of duty VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00927 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR918 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 630.1705 hours in the affected biweekly pay pe- riod and to sum those fractions or per-centages until the 12-week obligation is completed. (d) Conversion of weeks to days. For employees who are charged leave on a daily basis, the days equivalent of 12 weeks must be derived based on the av-erage number of workdays in the em-ployee’s established tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, consistent with the rules in §630.1703(d). (e) Agreement to make reimbursement when applicable. In the written agree- ment described in paragraph (a) of this section, the employee must attest that, in the event the employee does not complete the 12-week work obligation, he or she agrees, pursuant to paragraph (f), to make reimbursement unless the affected employing agency (or agen-cies) determines (determine) that the reimbursement provision will not be applied. (f) Application of reimbursement re- quirement. (1) If an employee fails to re- turn for the required 12 weeks of work with the applicable employing agency after paid parental leave concludes (as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section), an agency may require that the employee make a reimburse-ment equal to the total amount of any Government contributions paid by the agency on behalf of the employee to maintain the employee’s health insur-ance coverage under the Federal Em-ployees Health Benefits Program estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 during the period(s) when paid parental leave was used. An employee who separates from the applicable employing agency before completing the required 12 weeks of work is considered to have failed to return to duty under this paragraph. For the purpose of the pre-ceding sentence, an intra-agency reas-signment without a break in service will not be considered a separation. (2) The determination to impose the reimbursement requirement is at the agency’s sole and exclusive discretion, except that an agency may not impose the requirement if, in the agency’s judgment, the employee is unable to return to work for the required 12 weeks because of— (i) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition (in-cluding mental health) of the employee or the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the paid parental leave, but, in the case of the employ-ee’s serious health condition, only if the condition is related to the applica-ble birth or placement; or (ii) Any other circumstance beyond the employee’s control, subject to paragraph (h) of this section. (g) Medical certification. An agency’s determination not to apply the reim-bursement requirement may be condi-tioned upon the employee’s supplying of a health care provider certification supporting the employee’s claim that a serious health condition described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) is causing the em-ployee to', 'performance of exempt work. Directly and closely related work may include typically nonexempt tasks that arise out of and are integral to ex-empt duties. Those nonexempt tasks must be performed by the exempt em-ployee to perform his or her exempt work. Work directly and closely related to the performance of exempt duties may also include recordkeeping; main-taining various records pertaining to workload or employee performance; monitoring and adjusting machinery; taking notes; using the computer to create documents or presentations; opening the mail for the purpose of reading it and making decisions; and using a photocopier or fax machine. Work which both workers and super-visors are required to perform is con-sidered to be closely related to the pri-mary duty of the position (for example, physical training during tours of duty for firefighting and law enforcement personnel) and is exempt work. Work is not directly and closely related if the work is remotely related or completely unrelated to exempt duties. The fol-lowing examples illustrate the type of work that is and is not normally con-sidered as directly and closely related to exempt work: (1) Work is closely related to exempt supervisory work when it contributes to the effective supervision of subordi-nate workers, or the smooth func-tioning of the unit supervised, or both. A supervisor who spot checks and ex-amines the work of subordinates to de-termine whether they are performing their duties properly, and whether the product is satisfactory, is performing work which is directly and closely re-lated to managerial and supervisory VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00702 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR693 Office of Personnel Management § 551.104 functions, so long as the checking is distinguishable from the work ordi-narily performed by a nonexempt in-spector. (2) Depending upon the nature of an organization, a supervisor who sets up a machine may be engaged in exempt work. In some cases the setup work, or adjustment of the machine for a par-ticular job, is typically performed by the same employees who operate the machine. In such cases, setup work is part of the production operation and is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up of the work is a highly skilled oper-ation which the ordinary production worker typically does not perform. In large plants, non-supervisors may per-form such work. However, particularly in small plants, such work may be a regular duty of the executive employee and is directly and closely related to the executive employee’s responsibility for the subordinates’ work performance and for the adequacy of the final prod-uct. In addition, performing setup work that requires special skills typically is not performed by production employees in the occupation, and does not ap-proach the volume that would justify hiring a specially trained employee to perform. Such closely related work may include performing infrequently recurring or one-time tasks which are impractical to delegate, because they would disrupt normal operations or take longer to explain than to perform. Under such circumstances, it is exempt work. (3) A management analyst may take extensive notes recording the flow of work and materials through an organi-zation; the analyst may personally use a computer to type a report and create a proposed table of organization. Standing alone, or separated from the primary duty, such note-taking and typing would not be exempt. However, because this work is necessary for ana-lyzing the data and making rec-ommendations (which is exempt work), it is directly and closely related to ex-empt work. (4) A traffic manager in charge of planning an organization’s transpor-tation function, including identifying the most economical and quickest routes for shipping material to and from the activity, contracting for com-mon-carrier and other transportation facilities, negotiating with carriers for adjustments for damages to material, and making the necessary rearrange-ments resulting from delays, damages or irregularities in transit, is per-forming exempt work. If the employee also spends part of the day taking tele-phone orders for local deliveries, such order-taking is a routine function and is not directly and closely related to the exempt work. (5) An example of work directly and closely related to exempt professional duties is a chemist performing non-exempt tasks such as cleaning a test tube in the middle of an original exper-iment, even though such tasks can be assigned to laboratory assistants. (6) A teacher performs work directly and closely related to exempt duties when, while taking students on a field trip, the teacher drives a school van or monitors the students’ behavior in a restaurant. Educational establishment means a nursery school, an elementary or sec-ondary school system, an institution of higher education, other educational in-stitutions, and in certain cir-cumstances, training facilities. The term other educational establishment in- cludes special schools for mentally or physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of such schools as elementary, secondary, or higher. Emergency means a temporary condi- tion that poses a direct threat to human life or safety, serious damage to property, or serious disruption to the operations of an activity, as deter-mined by the employing agency. Employ means to engage a person in an activity that is for the benefit of an agency, including any hours of work that are suffered or permitted. Employee means a person who is em- ployed— (1) As a civilian in an Executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code; (2) As a civilian in a military depart- ment, as defined in section 102 of title 5, United States Code; (3) In a nonappropriated fund instru- mentality of an Executive agency or a military department; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00703 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR694 5 CFR Ch.

Employee']",4,"The context provides substantial details about paid parental leave requirements, including the need for an advance written agreement to work for 12 weeks after leave, documentation requirements, potential reimbursement obligations, and specific conditions around using the leave, with only minor details potentially missing.",5,"This question is highly useful and relevant for multiple stakeholders in federal employment. Paid parental leave is a critical benefit that directly impacts federal employees' work-life balance and family planning. The question addresses a specific policy area under Title 5 that is of significant practical importance to:

1. Employees planning to have or adopt children
2. HR specialists who need to process and understand leave policies
3. Managers dealing with employee leave requests
4. New and expectant parents seeking to understand their rights and benefits

The question seeks clear, actionable information about a specific type of leave, which is crucial for understanding federal employment benefits. It touches on an important aspect of employee support and family-friendly workplace policies. The broad applicability and practical nature of the inquiry make it extremely valuable for anyone involved in or interested in federal employment regulations related to parental leave."

Performance appraisal systems are fundamental to employee development, organizational effectiveness, and fair personnel management in federal agencies. Section 430.204 specifically outlines the core requirements for establishing performance evaluation frameworks, which is crucial information for:

1. HR Specialists: They need to understand the precise regulatory guidelines for designing and implementing performance appraisal systems.
2. Managers: Understanding these requirements helps them create fair, consistent, and legally compliant performance evaluation processes.
3. Federal Employees: Knowing the key requirements helps employees understand how their performance will be assessed and what standards they'll be measured against.

The question demonstrates a substantive information need about a core human capital management process. It seeks to clarify the regulatory standards that govern performance evaluations, which have direct implications for employee development, compensation, promotion, and organizational effectiveness. The technical reference to the specific CFR section (§430.204) also indicates a precise, professional approach to seeking regulatory information."

(a) This section covers the payment of performance awards to career ap-pointees in the Senior Executive Serv-ice (SES). (1) To be eligible for an award, the in- dividual must have been an SES career appointee as of the end of the perform-ance appraisal period; and the individ-ual’s most recent performance rating of record under part 430, subpart C, of this chapter for the appraisal period must have been ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or higher. (2) Individuals eligible for a perform- ance award include: (i) A former SES career appointee who elected to retain award eligibility under 5 CFR part 317, subpart H. If the rate of basic pay of the individual is higher than the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SES rate range, the maximum rate of that SES rate range is used for crediting the agency award pool under paragraph (b) of this section and the amount the individual may receive under paragraph (c) of this section. (ii) A reemployed annuitant with an SES career appointment. (iii) An SES career appointee who is on detail.

If the ap-pointee is on a reimbursable detail, the agency to which the appointee is de-tailed may reimburse the employing agency for some or all of any award, as agreed upon by the two agencies; but the reimbursement does not affect the award pool for either agency as cal-culated under paragraph (b) or this sec-tion. (3) When making recommendations on performance awards, more than one- half of the membership of a Perform-ance Review Board must be career SES appointees. The only exception is if OPM has determined under §430.307(d) of this chapter that the Board does not have to have a majority of career mem-bers when making recommendations on performance appraisals of career ap-pointees because there exists an insuf-ficient number of career appointees. (4) The agency head must consider the recommendations of the Perform-ance Review Board (PRB), but the agency head has the final authority as to who is to receive a performance award and the amount of the award. (b)(1) The total amount of perform- ance awards paid during a fiscal year by an agency may not exceed the greater of— (i) Ten percent of the aggregate ca- reer SES rates of basic pay for the agency as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the award payments are made; or (ii) Twenty percent of the average annual rates of basic pay for career SES appointees of the agency as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the award payments are made. (2) In determining the aggregate ca- reer SES rates of basic pay and the av-erage annual rate of basic pay as of the end of FY 2003 for the purpose of apply- ing paragraph (b) of this section, agen-cies must use the annual rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or special geographic pay adjust-ment established for law enforcement officers under section 404(a) of the Fed-eral Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101–509), which the SES appointees were receiving at the end of FY 2003. (c) The amount of a performance award paid to an individual career ap-pointee may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 20 percent of the ap-pointee’s SES rate of basic pay as of the end of the performance appraisal period. (d) OPM shall issue guidance con- cerning the distribution of performance awards within an agency. (e) Agencies shall submit their dis- tribution of performance awards, the total amount of awards, and the aggre-gate payroll or average rate of basic pay as computed under paragraph (b) of this section to OPM no later than 14 days after the date the performance awards are approved by the agency. If OPM determines that an agency’s pay-ments do not meet the requirements of law or regulations, the agency shall take any corrective action directed by OPM. (f) Performance awards must be paid in a lump sum except in those in-stances when it is not possible to pay the full amount because of the applica-ble aggregate limitation on pay during a calendar year under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. In that case, any amount in excess of the applicable aggregate limi-tation must be paid at the beginning of the following calendar year in accord-ance with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. The full performance award, however, is charged against the agency bonus pool under §534.405(b) for the fiscal year in which the initial payment was made.

Locality pay is a critical component of federal compensation, and understanding how rates are calculated across different pay periods is essential for accurate wage determination. The question addresses a specific technical aspect of Title 5 regulations related to pay administration, which is directly applicable to federal employment compensation policies. 

The query demonstrates a genuine need for precise information about pay calculations, which can impact budgeting, compensation planning, and employee understanding of their earnings. HR professionals and payroll administrators would find this particularly useful for ensuring compliance with federal pay regulations and explaining compensation structures to employees. While the question is somewhat technical, it represents a concrete information need that has direct practical implications for federal workforce management.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it's somewhat narrow in scope, focusing on a specific calculation method rather than a broader policy interpretation. However, it remains a valuable question for anyone involved in federal pay administration or seeking to understand the intricacies of federal compensation systems."

This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329, which establishes a leave cat-egory, to be known as ‘‘disabled vet-eran leave,’’ for an eligible employee who is a veteran with a service-con-nected disability rated at 30 percent or more. Such an employee is entitled to this leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability. Disabled veteran leave must be used during the 12-month period beginning on the first day of employment. OPM’s authority to regulate section 6329 is found in section 2(d) of Public Law 114– 75. § 630.1302 Applicability. This subpart applies to an employee who is a veteran with a service-con-nected disability rated at 30 percent or more, subject to the conditions speci-fied in this subpart. This subpart does not apply to employees of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission who are sub-ject to regulations issued by the Post-master General under section 2(d)(2) of Public Law 114–75. This subpart applies only to an employee who is hired on or after November 5, 2016. § 630.1303 Definitions. In this subpart: 12-month eligibility period means the continuous 12-month period that begins on the first day of employment. For an employee who was eligible (or later de-termined to have been eligible) for dis-abled veteran leave as an employee of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission and who subsequently commences employ-ment covered by this subpart, the 12- month eligibility period is the period that began on the first day of employ-ment with the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Com-mission (as determined under regula-tions issued by the Postmaster General to implement 5 U.S.C. 6329). Agency means an agency of the Fed- eral Government. In the case of an agency in the Executive branch, it means an Executive agency as', 'this section, agencies should take into account: (1) Agency authority to modify quali- fication requirements in certain situa-tions as provided in the OPM Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions; (2) Agency authority to establish training programs that provide inten-sive and directly job-related training to substitute for all or part of the expe-rience (but not education, licensing, certification, or other specific creden-tials), required by OPM qualification standards. Such training programs may be established to provide employ-ees with the opportunity to acquire the experience and knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to qualify for an-other position (including at a higher grade) at an accelerated rate; and VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00356 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR347 Office of Personnel Management § 410.308 (3) Time-in-grade restrictions on ad- vancement (see 5 CFR 300.603(b)(6)). (b) Training for promotion. Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103, and con-sistent with merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1) and (2), an agency may provide training to non- temporary employees that in certain instances may lead to promotion. An agency must follow its competitive procedures under part 335 of this chap-ter when selecting a non-temporary employee for training that permits noncompetitive promotion after suc-cessful completion of the training. (c) Training for placement in other agency positions, in other agencies, or outside Government —(1) Grade or pay re- tention. Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103 and 5 U.S.C. 5364, an agency may train an employee to meet the quali-fication requirements of another posi-tion in the agency if the new position is at or below the retained grade or the grade of the position the employee held before pay retention. (2) Training for placement in another agency. Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103(b), and consistent with merit sys-tem principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301, an agency may train an employee to meet the qualification requirements of a position in another agency if the head of the agency determines that such training would be in the interest of the Government. (i) Before undertaking any training under this section, the head of the agency shall determine that there ex-ists a reasonable expectation of place-ment in another agency. (ii) When selecting an employee for training under this section, the head of the agency shall consider: (A) The extent to which the employ- ee’s current skills, knowledge, and abilities may be utilized in the new po-sition; (B) The employee’s capability to learn skills and acquire knowledge and abilities needed in the new position; and (C) The benefits to the Government which would result from retaining the employee in the Federal service. (3) Training displaced or surplus em- ployees. Displaced or surplus employees as defined in 5 CFR 330.602 may be eli-gible for training or retraining for posi-tions outside Government through pro- grams provided under 29 U.S.C. 1651, or similar authorities. An agency may use its appropriated funds for training dis-placed or surplus employees for posi-tions outside Government only when specifically authorized by legislation to do so. (4) Career transition assistance plans. Under 5 CFR part 330, subpart F, agen-cies are required to establish career transition assistance plans (CTAP) to provide career transition services to displaced and surplus employees. (i) Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4109, an agency may: (A) Train employees in the use of the CTAP services; (B) Provide vocational and career as- sessment and counseling services; (C) Train employees in job search skills, techniques, and strategies; and (D) Pay for training related expenses as provided in 5 U.S.C. 4109(a)(2). (ii) Agency CTAP’s will include plans for retraining displaced or surplus em-ployees covered by this part.

(a) An agency may authorize training for an employee to obtain an academic degree under conditions prescribed at 5 U.S.C. 4107(a). (b) Colleges and universities partici- pating in an academic degree training program must be accredited by a na-tionally recognized body. A ‘‘nation-ally recognized body’’ is a regional, na-tional, or international accrediting or-ganization recognized by the U.S. De-partment of Education. The listing of accrediting bodies is available through the Department. (c) The selection of employees for an academic degree training program must follow the requirements of §335.103(b)(3), §335.103(c)(1)(iii), and sub-part A of part 300 of this chapter. The selection and assignment must be ac-complished to meet one or more of the criteria identified in 5 U.S.C. 4107(a).

Agencies have the authority to deter-mine when such agreements will be re-quired. (b) Requirements. (1) The head of the agency shall establish written proce-dures which include the minimum re-quirements for continued service agreements. These requirements shall include procedures the agency con-siders necessary to protect the Govern-ment’s interest should the employee fail to successfully complete training. (2) An employee selected for training subject to an agency continued service agreement must sign an agreement to continue in service after training prior to starting the training. The period of service will equal at least three times the length of the training. (3) The head of an agency shall estab- lish procedures to compute length of training period for academic degree training programs in accordance with §410.310(d). (c) Failure to fulfill agreements. With a signed agreement, the agency has a right to recover training costs, except pay or other compensation, if the em-ployee voluntarily separates from Gov-ernment service.

The question explores noncompetitive acquisition of competitive status, which is a nuanced but important topic for:

1. HR Specialists: They need to understand precise conditions for granting competitive status to ensure proper hiring and placement procedures.

2. Federal Employees: Those seeking career advancement or transitioning between roles will want to know potential pathways to competitive status without traditional competitive examinations.

3. Managers: Understanding these conditions helps in strategic workforce planning and recruitment.

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of federal employment regulations, specifically addressing a complex procedural aspect of hiring and status determination. It goes beyond surface-level inquiries and seeks substantive knowledge about a specific regulatory mechanism.

Potential conditions might include veterans' preference, internal competitive service transfers, or specific excepted service conversions - all of which have significant implications for federal employment opportunities and career development.

The technical nature of the question suggests it would be particularly valuable for professionals deeply engaged with federal employment policies and procedures, making it a high-utility inquiry for those working within or studying the federal employment system."

(c) Under the circumstances set forth in §581.305 (a) or (b), or where the gov-ernmental entity is directed by the Justice Department not to comply with the legal process, the entity shall respond directly to the court, or other authority, setting forth its objections to compliance with the legal process. In addition, the governmental entity shall inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the par-ty’s representative, that the legal proc-ess will not be honored. Thereafter, if litigation is initiated or threatened, the entity shall immediately refer the matter to the United States Attorney for the district from which the legal process issued. To ensure uniformity in the executive branch, governmental entities which have statutory author-ity to represent themselves in court shall coordinate their representation with the United States Attorney. (d) If a governmental entity is served with more than one legal process for the same moneys due or payable to an individual, the entity shall comply with §581.303(a). Provided, That in no event will the total amount garnished for any pay or disbursement cycle ex-ceed the applicable limitation set forth in §581.402. (e)(1) Neither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor any govern-mental entity shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or payable by, the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part. (2) Neither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor any govern-mental entity shall be liable under this part to pay money damages for failure to comply with legal process. (f) Governmental entities affected by legal process served under this part shall not be required to vary their nor-mal pay or disbursement cycles to comply with the legal process. How-ever, legal process, valid at the time of service, which is received too late to be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it is received, shall be honored to the extent that the legal process may be satisfied during the next dis-bursement cycle within the limits set forth in §581.402. The fact that the legal process may have expired during this period would not relieve the gov-ernmental entity of its obligation to honor legal process which was valid at the time of service. If, in the next dis-bursement cycle, no further payment will be due from the entity to the obli-gor, the entity shall follow the proce-dures set forth in §581.306. (g) If a governmental entity receives legal process which, on its face, ap-pears to conform to the laws of the ju-risdiction from which it was issued, the entity shall not be required to ascer-tain whether the authority which issued the legal process had obtained personal jurisdiction over the obligor. (h) A failure by the party bringing the garnishment action to comply with the provisions of the Uniform Recip-rocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) or the Revised Uniform Re-ciprocal Enforcement of Support Act by itself shall not be a valid basis for a governmental entity to refuse to com-ply with legal process.

(c) In instances where an employee obligor separates from his/her employ-ment with a governmental entity which is presently honoring a con-tinuing legal process, the entity shall inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the party’s rep-resentative, and the court, or other au-thority, that the payments are being discontinued.

(1) An agency may make 2-year appointments to the PMF Program, pursuant to a Pathways Pol-icy, under Schedule D of the excepted service in accordance with part 302 of this chapter. (2) An agency must appoint a PMF using the excepted service appointing authority provided by §213.3402(c) of this chapter. (3) OPM will establish an eligibility period during which agencies may ap-point Fellow finalists. (b) Extension. An agency may extend a Fellow’s appointment for up to 120 days to cover rare or unusual cir-cumstances or situations. The agency’s Pathways MOU must identify the cri-teria for approving extensions. (c) Grade. An agency may appoint a Fellow at the GS–09, GS–11, or GS–12 level or equivalent depending on his or her qualifications. (d) Trial period. The duration of the PMF appointment in the excepted serv-ice is a trial period. (e) Work schedules. A PMF will gen- erally have a full-time work schedule. A PMF may request a part-time work schedule for a limited period of up to 6 months during the PMF Program. An agency has the discretion to approve or deny a request for a part-time work schedule if the agency and PMF have determined that it would not nega-tively impact the PMF’s ability to meet all Program requirements by the expiration of the PMF’s appointment. The agency’s approval of the request must include an approval of a specific time period that the agency determines to be appropriate. A PMF is not enti-tled to approval of a request for a part- time work schedule. An agency’s Path-ways Policy must specify the condi-tions under which a part-time work schedule may be authorized. The PMF’s Pathways Participant agree-ment must be updated with the new work schedule information when a part-time work schedule is approved. [77 FR 28215, May 11, 2012, as amended at 89 FR 25774, Apr. 12, 2024] § 362.405 Development, evaluation, promotion, and certification. (a) Individual Development Plans. An agency must approve, within 90 days, an Individual Development Plan (IDP) for each of its PMFs that sets forth the specific developmental activities that are mutually agreed upon by each PMF and their supervisor. The PMF must develop the IDP in consultation with the Agency PMF Coordinator and/or the mentor assigned to the PMF under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as well as the PMF’s supervisor. (b) Required developmental activities. (1) OPM will provide leadership devel-opment activities and general Program resources for each class or cohort of PMFs and will provide information on available training opportunities known to it. Agencies must provide appro-priate agency-specific onboarding and employee orientation activities. (2) The agency must provide each Fellow a minimum of 80 hours of for-mal interactive training per year that addresses the competencies outlined in the IDP. Mandatory annual training, such as information security and ethics training, does not count towards the 80-hour requirement. (3) Within the first 90 days of a Fel- low’s appointment, the agency must assign the Fellow a mentor, who is a managerial employee outside the Fel- low’s chain of command. (4) The agency must provide each PMF with at least one rotational or de-velopmental assignment with full-time management and/or technical respon-sibilities consistent with the PMF’s IDP. With respect to the requirement in this paragraph (b)(4): (i) Each PMF must receive at least one developmental assignment of 4 to 6 months in duration, with management and/or technical responsibilities con-sistent with the PMF’s IDP. (ii) The developmental assignment may be within the PMF’s organization, in another component of the agency, or in another Federal agency as permitted VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00346 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR337 Office of Personnel Management § 362.407 by the employing agency. These assign- ments should generally be in a dif-ferent work unit led by a supervisor other than the usual supervisor of the PMF’s current position. (iii) Developmental assignments must provide challenging work experi-ence of a caliber appropriate for a par-ticipant in the Federal Government’s flagship leadership development pro-gram. Examples of appropriate devel-opmental assignments may include projects implementing a new Executive order or major piece of legislation, agency reorganization, or cross-agency collaboration on a major administra-tion initiative. (5) The PMF may receive other short- term rotational assignments of 1 to 6 months in duration, at the agency’s discretion. A short-term rotational as-signment may take place within the PMF’s organization, in another compo-nent of the agency, or in another Fed-eral agency as permitted by the em-ploying agency. (6) Upon the request of OPM, the ap- pointing agency must make Fellows available to assist in the assessment process for subsequent PMF classes. Any interactive training provided to a Fellow in connection with assisting OPM in the assessment process may be counted toward the minimum 80-hour training requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (c) Promotion. An agency may pro- mote any Fellow who meets the quali-fication requirements for the position. This provision does not confer entitle-ment to promotion. (d) Certification of completion. (1) Upon completion of the Program, the agen-cy’s ERB must evaluate each Fellow and determine whether it can certify in writing that the', 'a direct threat to life or property. Requests submitted on that basis must meet the following cri-teria: (1) Nature of emergency. Describe the military threat, natural disaster, or other unforeseen occurrence, the date it occurred, and the expected duration of the emergency response effort. (2) Need for the individual’s services. The agency must show either that the individual is uniquely qualified for the emergency response work to be done or that the number of positions to be filled and/or urgency of response justi-fies making the particular appoint-ment without further delay. OPM will not approve reemployment without penalty under 5 U.S.C. 8344, or 8468 solely to meet normal seasonal work-load fluctuations. (d) Requests based on severe recruiting difficulty. Generally, requests for excep- tion will be based on exceptional dif-ficulty in recruiting a qualified can-didate for a particular position. Re-quests submitted on this basis must in-clude a description of the length, breadth, and results of the agency’s re-cruiting efforts for the position and any other factors demonstrating that a legitimate recruiting need cannot be met without the requested waiver. These factors may include, but are not limited to, unusual qualification re- quirements or working conditions, pos-sibility of job reengineering or con-tracting, or a need to fill the position without further delay. (e) Exceptions based on need to retain a particular individual. In very rare cases, an exception may be appropriate when an agency needs to retain the services of a particular individual who is uniquely qualified for an ongoing VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00735 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR726 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 553.202 project. Requests submitted on this basis must meet the following criteria: (1) Critical nature of project. The agen- cy must describe the importance of the project to the agency’s mission, the po-tential costs of project failure or delay, legislative or Presidential deadlines, if any, and any other factors dem-onstrating that the project is unusu-ally critical. Exceptions will not be ap-proved under this paragraph merely to avoid delay in scheduled completion of ongoing work. (2) Candidate’s unique qualifications. The agency must describe the knowl-edges, skills, and abilities possessed by the individual that are essential for successful completion of the project and that could not be acquired by an-other appointee within a reasonable time. (3) Need for retention. The agency must show good cause to believe that the employee will retire (or, in the case of an individual currently reemployed without an exception, will resign from that position) and that the agency will lose his or her services if the exception is not granted. (4) Other staffing options. While an agency in this situation is not required to conduct outside recruiting, the re-quest for exception must address why the work could not be assigned to other employees involved with the same project. (f) Requests based on other unusual cir- cumstances. An agency may request re- employment without penalty for an in-dividual whose services are needed on a temporary basis due to other unusual circumstances. Agencies must provide justification describing the unusual circumstances. (g) Length of exceptions. OPM may specify a time limit for reemployment without penalty of any individual ap-proved under this subpart. If the agen-cy wishes to continue the exception for an individual beyond the specified time, the request for renewal must demonstrate that the conditions justi-fying the initial exception still exist.

(a) Request by agency head. The head of an agency may request OPM to dele-gate to the agency authority to ap-prove individual exceptions on a case- by-case basis in specific circumstances. Authority to submit such a request may not be redelegated to an official below the agency’s headquarters level (or, in the case of the Department of Defense, to an official below the head-quarters level of the military depart-ment or Defense agency). (b) Content of request. The request for delegation must include: (1) Description of the situations for which authority is requested. The situ-ation must result from emergencies posing immediate and direct threat to life or property or from other unusual circumstances. (2) Identification of the occupations, grades, and locations of positions that might be filled under the delegated au-thority. (3) Statement of the expected dura- tion of the reemployment to be ap-proved under the requested authority. (c) Delegation agreement. OPM will set out the conditions for use of each au-thority that it delegates under the pro-visions of this section in a delegation agreement. The agreement will remain in effect without time limit unless OPM specifies a termination date in the agreement, or unless OPM with-draws the delegated authority upon finding that the circumstances justi-fying the delegation have changed sub-stantially or that the agency has failed to manage the authority in accordance with the law, the regulations, and the agreement itself.

Payment of travel and transportation expenses will be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR chapters 301– 304). (b) An agency may determine which interviewees are eligible for payment of pre-employment interview travel ex-penses. Payment of these travel', 'ex-emption is claimed because portions of this system relate to records required by statute to be maintained and used solely for statistical purposes. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the confidentiality of these records and their usefulness for statistical research purposes.

(a) Job analysis. Each employment practice of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, shall be based on a job analysis to iden-tify: (1) The basic duties and responsibil- ities; (2) The knowledges, skills, and abili- ties required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis may cover a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common charac-teristics. (b) Relevance. (1) There shall be a ra- tional relationship between perform-ance in the position to be filled (or in the target position in the case of an entry position) and the employment', 'from this product. The difference is the amount owed to the employee for com-pleted service. (f)(1) For retention incentives that are paid when no service agreement is required under §575.310(f), an agency must review each determination to pay the incentive at least annually to de-termine whether payment is still war-ranted. An authorized agency official must certify this determination in writing. (2) An agency may continue paying a retention incentive to an employee when no service agreement is required as long as the conditions giving rise to the original determination to pay the incentive still exist. (3) An authorized agency official must reduce or terminate a retention incentive authorization when no serv-ice agreement is required whenever conditions change such that the origi-nal determination to pay the retention incentive no longer applies (e.g., when the agency assigns the employee to a different position that is not within VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00759 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR750 5 CFR Ch.

(4) An authorized agency official may terminate unilaterally a retention in-centive authorization when no service agreement is required based solely on the management needs of the agency, even if the conditions giving rise to the original determination to pay the in-centive still exist. For example, an agency may terminate a retention in-centive when there are insufficient funds to continue the planned reten-tion incentive payments.

(g) The termination of a retention in- centive service agreement or the reduc-tion or termination of a retention in-centive under this section is not grievable or appealable. (h) If an agency terminates a reten- tion incentive service agreement or re-duces or terminates a retention incen-tive paid without a service agreement under this section, the agency must no-tify the employee in writing. When a retention incentive is terminated under paragraph (f) of this section, the employee is entitled to receive any scheduled incentive payments through the end of the pay period in which the written notice is provided or until the date of separation, if sooner.

(a) Each agency must monitor the use of retention incentives to ensure that its retention incentive plan and the payment of retention incentives are consistent with the requirements and criteria established under 5 U.S.C. 5754 and this subpart. (b) When OPM finds that an agency is not paying retention incentives con-sistent with the agency’s retention in-centive plan and the criteria estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. 5754 or this sub-part or otherwise determines that the agency is not using this authority se-lectively and judiciously, OPM may— (1) Direct the agency to revoke or suspend the authority granted to any organizational component of the agen-cy and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the component obtain approval from the agency’s headquarters level before paying a retention incentive to such employees; or (2) Revoke or suspend the authority granted to the agency under this sub-part for all or any part of the agency and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the agency obtain OPM’s approval be-fore paying a retention incentive to such employees. § 575.313 Records and reports.

For Presidential Management Fellows (PMFs), understanding their work schedule flexibility is crucial for career planning and work-life balance. HR specialists and program managers would find this information important for program administration and policy implementation. The question addresses a specific aspect of the PMF program that directly impacts participants' employment conditions, making it valuable for those navigating federal employment policies under Title 5.

The question's strength lies in its specificity - focusing on a particular work arrangement within a defined federal fellowship program. It touches on important workplace flexibility considerations that are increasingly relevant in modern federal employment contexts. While not addressing a universal federal employment issue, it provides targeted insight into a specific professional development program that is part of the federal government's talent acquisition and management strategy.

The practical applicability is high for current and prospective PMFs, HR professionals managing fellowship programs, and those interested in understanding flexible work arrangements within federal career development initiatives. The question demonstrates a genuine need for precise information about work schedule options within a specific federal employment program."

(2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in §630.201 and described in §630.210), the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the em-ployee’s biweekly scheduled tour of duty (or 6 times the average hours if the biweekly tour hours vary over an established cycle). For example, if an employee has an uncommon tour con-sisting of six 24-hours shifts (144 hours) per biweekly pay period, the amount would be 864 hours. (3) For a part-time employee, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the em-ployee’s scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee has a part-time scheduled tour of duty that consists of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the amount would be 240 hours. (d) Conversion of weeks to days.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 630.1703 workdays in the employee’s established tour of duty over a biweekly pay pe-riod. For example, if an employee had 8 workdays each biweekly pay period, the days equivalent of 12 administra-tive workweeks would be 48 days. (e) Change in tour. If there is a change in an employee’s scheduled tour of duty during the 12-month period com-mencing on the date of a given birth or placement, and the employee has not used the full allotment of paid parental leave during such 12-month period, the remaining balance of paid parental leave must be recalculated based on the change in the number of average hours in the employee’s scheduled tour of duty. For example, if a regular full- time employee has a balance of 120 hours of unused paid parental leave for a 12-month period that is in progress and then converts to a part-time sched-ule of 20 hours per week, the balance would be recalculated to be 60 hours. (Since the old schedule was 80 hours bi-weekly or an average of 40 hours week-ly, the new part-time tour is half of the former full-time tour. 40/80 times 120 equals 60.) (f) Leave usage. (1) An agency may not require an employee to use annual leave or sick leave to the employee’s credit as a condition to be met before the employee uses paid parental leave. An employee may request to use an-nual leave or sick leave without invok-ing FMLA unpaid leave under subpart L of this part, and, in that case, the agency exercises its normal authority with respect to approving or dis-approving the timing of when the leave may be used. (2) Paid parental leave may be used in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement only during the 12- month period following birth or place-ment. (See §630.1703(b).) Paid parental leave may not be used prior to the birth or placement involved even if the employee was granted FMLA unpaid leave under §630.1203(a)(1) or (2) for pe-riods prior to the birth or placement event, as allowed under §630.1203(d). (3) An employee with a seasonal work schedule may not use paid parental leave during the off-season period des-ignated by the agency—the period dur-ing which the employee is scheduled to be released from work and placed in nonpay status. (g) Treatment of unused leave. If an employee has any unused balance of paid parental leave that remains at the end of the 12-month period following the birth or placement involved, the entitlement to the unused leave elapses at that time. No payment may be made for unused paid parental leave that has expired. Paid parental leave may not be considered annual leave for purposes of making a lump-sum payment for an-nual leave or for any other purpose. (h) Documentation of entitlement and employee certification. (1) At the request of the employee’s agency, an employee must provide the agency with appro-priate documentation that shows that the employee’s use of paid parental leave is directly connected to a birth or placement that has occurred. Appro-priate documentation may include, but is not limited to, a birth certificate or a document from an adoption or foster care agency regarding the placement. An agency is responsible for deter-mining what documentation is suffi-cient proof of entitlement. (2) An agency may require that an employee sign a certification attesting that the paid parental leave is being taken in connection with a birth or placement. This employee certification may contain a statement in which the employee acknowledges an under-standing of the consequences of pro-viding a false certification (e.g., the possibility that the employing agency could pursue appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal Service, or make a refer-ral to a Federal entity that inves-tigates whether conduct constitutes a criminal violation). (3) An employee must provide any documentation or certification re-quired by the agency no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such documentation or certifi-cation. If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for an employee to respond within the 15-day time frame, despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts, the em-ployee must provide the documenta-tion or certification within a reason-able period of time under the cir-cumstances involved, but no later than VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00926 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR917 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1705 30 calendar days after the date of the agency’s original request.

Under these circumstances, the granting of paid pa-rental leave is considered to be provi-sional, pending receipt of the requested documentation or certification.

Health care provider has the meaning given that term in §630.1202. Hired means the action of— (1) Receiving an initial appointment to a civilian position in the Federal Government in which the service quali-fies as employment under this subpart; (2) Receiving a qualifying reappoint- ment to a civilian position in the Fed-eral Government in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart; or (3) Returning to duty status in a ci- vilian position in the Federal Govern-ment in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart, when such return immediately followed a break in civilian duty (with the em-ployee in continuous civilian leave sta-tus) to perform military service. Medical certificate means a written statement signed by a health care pro-vider certifying to the treatment of a veteran’s qualifying service-connected disability. Medical treatment means any activity carried out or prescribed by a health care provider to treat a veteran’s quali-fying service-connected disability. Military service means ‘‘active mili- tary, naval, or air service’’ as that term is defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(24). Qualifying reappointment means an appointment of a former employee of the Federal Government following a break in employment of at least 90 cal-endar days. Qualifying service-connected disability means a veteran’s service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more by the Veteran Benefits Administra-tion, including a combined degree of disability of 30 percent or more that re-flects the combined effect of multiple individual disabilities, which resulted in the award of disability compensa-tion under title 38, United States Code. A temporary disability rating under 38 U.S.C. 1156 is considered a valid rating in applying this definition for as long as it is in effect. Service-connected has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). Veteran has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(2). Veterans Benefits Administration means the Veterans Benefits Adminis-tration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. § 630.1304 Eligibility.

For each employee, there is a single first day of employment. (b) In order to be eligible for disabled veteran leave, an employee must pro-vide to the agency documentation from the Veterans Benefits Administration certifying that the employee has a qualifying service-connected disability. The documentation should be provided to the agency— (1) Upon the first day of employment, if the employee has already received such certifying documentation; or (2) For an employee who has not yet received such certifying documenta-tion from the Veterans Benefit Admin-istration, as soon as practicable after the employee receives the certifying documentation.

The 12-month eligibility period is fixed based on the first day of employment and is not af-fected by the timing of when certifying documentation is provided. (d) If an employee’s service-con- nected disability rating is decreased or discontinued during the 12-month eligi-bility period such that the employee no longer has a qualifying service-con-nected disability— (1) The employee must notify the agency of the effective date of the change in the disability rating; and (2) The employee is no longer eligible for disabled veteran leave as of the ef-fective date of the rating change. § 630.1305 Crediting disabled veteran leave. (a) Upon receipt of the certifying documentation under §630.1304, an agency must credit 104 hours of dis-abled veteran leave to a full-time, non-seasonal employee or a proportionally equivalent amount for employees with part-time, seasonal, or uncommon tours of duty, except as otherwise pro-vided in this section. (b) The proportional equivalent of 104 hours for a full-time employee is deter-mined for employees with other sched-ules as follows: (1) For an employee with a part-time work schedule, the 104 hours is pro-rated based on the number of hours in the part-time schedule (as established for leave charging purposes) relative to a full-time schedule (e.g., 52 hours for a half-time schedule); (2) For an employee with a seasonal work schedule, the 104 hours is pro-rated based on the total projected hours to be worked in an annual period of 52 weeks (based on the seasonal em-ployee’s seasonal work periods and full- time or part-time schedule during those periods) relative to a full-time work year of 2,080 hours (e.g., 52 hours for a seasonal employee who works full-time for half a year); and (3) For an employee with an uncom- mon tour of duty (as', 'Director, 6508 Dogwood Parkway, Suite E, Jackson, MS 39213, (601) 965–4140 Human Resources Management Officer, Montgomery Medical Center, 215 Perry Hill Road, Montgomery, AL 36109–3798, (334) 272– 4670 Human Resources Management Officer, Tuskegee Medical Center, 2400 Hospital Road, Tuskegee, AL 36083–5001, (334) 727– 0550 Human Resources Management Officer, Tus- caloosa Medical Center, 3701 Loop Road, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404, (205) 554–2000, ext. 2542 Fort Mitchell National Cemetery, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center, 2400 Hospital Road, Tuskegee, AL 36083–5001, (334) 727–0550 Mobile Outpatient Clinic Substation, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center, 400 Veterans Blvd., Bi-loxi, MS 39531, (601) 388–5541, ext. 5780 Alaska Fort Richardson (Sitka) National Cemetery, Send to: Human Resources Management Officer, VA Medical Center & Regional Of-fice, 2925 DeBarr Road, Anchorage, AK 99508–2989, (907) 257–4750 Human Resources Management Officer, An- chorage Medical Center & Regional Office, 2925 DeBarr Road, Anchorage, AK 99508– 2989, (907) 257–4750 Arizona Human Resources Management Officer, Pres- cott Medical Center, 500 N.

(d) An SESCDP is a training oppor- tunity for which agencies must recruit consistent with merit system prin-ciples and paragraph (d)(1) of this sec-tion. An agency must provide proce-dures under which selections are made from among either all qualified persons or all qualified persons in the civil service. If selected, the individual par-ticipates in the agency’s SESCDP. (1) An individual who does not cur- rently hold a career or career-type civil service appointment may only participate in an SESCDP by means of a Schedule B appointment authorized by 5 CFR 213.3202(j) to a full-time posi-tion created for developmental pur-poses connected with the SESCDP. Ex-ercising its authority under §302.101(c)(6) of this chapter, OPM here-by exempts these full-time positions created for developmental purposes connected with the SESCDP from the appointment procedures of part 302 of this chapter. Competition for these ap-pointments must be conducted pursu-ant to SES merit staffing procedures at §317.501 of this chapter, except agencies must follow the principle of veterans’ preference as far as administratively feasible, in accordance with §302.101(c) of this chapter. Candidates serving under this Schedule B appointment may not be used to fill an agency’s reg-ular positions on a continuing basis. (2) An individual who currently holds a career or career-type appointment in the civil service must be selected through SES merit staffing procedures at §317.501 of this chapter. Subject to the approval of the agency in which the selectee is employed, such an indi-vidual may be selected for and partici-pate in an SESCDP in any agency while serving in his or her position of record. The individual may continue to participate in the SESCDP upon mov-ing to other civil service positions under career or career-type appoint-ment, assuming the employing agency approves. An SESCDP competition does not satisfy the requirements of part 335 of this chapter and therefore does not provide an independent basis to appoint or promote a career or ca-reer-type appointee. (3) A career or career-type appointee may participate in an SESCDP con-ducted by an agency other than his or her employing agency under such terms as are mutually agreeable and outlined in a Memorandum of Under-standing (MOU) signed by both agen-cies involved. The MOU should be sub-mitted to OPM after the candidate is selected and before the program begins. Terms of the MOU must be consistent with applicable provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, and a copy must be pro-vided to OPM. Either agency may de- cline or discontinue a candidate’s par-ticipation if such terms cannot be ne-gotiated or are not fulfilled. (4) Any candidate’s participation in an SESCDP is at the discretion of the employing agency and subject to provi-sions established under 5 CFR 412.302(a) for removing a participant who does not make adequate progress in the pro-gram. (5) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a ‘‘career-type’’ appointment means a career or career-conditional appoint-ment or an appointment of equivalent tenure. An appointment of equivalent tenure is considered to be an appoint-ment in the excepted service that is placed in Group I or Group II under section 351.502(b).

It directly addresses a specific benefit provision under Title 5 that is critically important for federal employees planning families, HR specialists managing leave policies, and managers understanding employee entitlements. Paid parental leave is a significant workplace policy that impacts work-life balance, employee retention, and family support. The question seeks precise, actionable information about a concrete benefit entitlement, which makes it extremely practical and valuable. Federal employees, especially those considering or expecting children, would find this information essential for understanding their workplace rights and benefits. HR professionals would rely on such specific details for accurate leave administration and employee counseling. The straightforward, clear phrasing of the question ensures that the information need is direct and unambiguous."
" What restrictions exist for Senior Executive Service (SES) members regarding premium pay and compensatory time?
"," According to 5 CFR 534.408, SES members are excluded from premium pay, including overtime pay. As a result, they are not eligible for compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay when performing SES duties. However, they are still eligible for compensatory time off for religious purposes under 5 U.S.C. 5550a and 5 CFR part 550, subpart J.","['Rural Business-Cooperative Service, Rural Utilities Service, and Farm Service Agency, Depart-ment of Agriculture (Parts 1800—2099) XX [Reserved] XXV Office of Advocacy and Outreach, Department of Agriculture (Parts 2500—2599) XXVI Office of Inspector General, Department of Agriculture (Parts 2600—2699) XXVII Office of Information Resources Management, Department of Agriculture (Parts 2700—2799) XXVIII Office of Operations, Department of Agriculture (Parts 2800— 2899) XXIX Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, Department of Agri- culture (Parts 2900—2999) XXX Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Department of Agriculture (Parts 3000—3099) XXXI Office of Environmental Quality, Department of Agriculture (Parts 3100—3199) XXXII Office of Procurement and Property Management, Department of Agriculture (Parts 3200—3299) XXXIII Office of Transportation, Department of Agriculture (Parts 3300—3399) XXXIV National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Parts 3400—3499) XXXV Rural Housing Service, Department of Agriculture (Parts 3500— 3599) XXXVI National Agricultural Statistics Service, Department of Agri- culture (Parts 3600—3699) VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00937 Fmt 8092 Sfmt 8092 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR928 Chap.

The newly converted rate is the senior executive’s SES rate of basic pay. An agency’s establishment of an SES rate of basic pay for a senior executive under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of ap-plying §534.404(c). (b) An SES member’s rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 to which the employee was enti-tled on November 24, 2003, may not be reduced for 1 year after the first day of the first applicable pay period begin-ning on or after January 1, 2004. If an SES member’s rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based com-parability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 to which the employee was entitled on November 23, 2003, is higher than the rate in effect immediately prior to the first day of the first applicable pay pe-riod beginning on or after January 1, 2004, the agency must use the higher rate for the purpose of converting SES members to the SES pay system. (c) An SES member who is assigned to a position outside the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia to a position overseas or in Alaska, Ha-waii, Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. territories and possessions as of the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, will be converted to a new rate of basic pay that equals the senior execu-tive’s current rate of basic pay, plus the amount of locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for the applicable locality pay area upon the employee’s initial reassignment to a position in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia. The adjustment will be prospective, not retroactive, and it will not be considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying §534.404(c). If the senior executive’s rate of basic pay did not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule while assigned to a position outside the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, upon initial reassignment to a locality pay area the senior executive’s con-verted rate of basic pay may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The newly converted rate is the senior executive’s SES rate of basic pay. (d) On the first day of the first appli- cable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, a law enforcement offi-cer (LEO), as defined in 5 CFR 531.301, who is a member of the SES will have his or her rate of basic pay, plus any applicable special geographic pay ad-justment established for LEOs under section 404(a) of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101–509) to which he or she was entitled immediately before that date, con-verted to a new SES rate of basic pay.

Redesignated and amended at 69 FR 70362, 70367, Dec. 6, 2004] Subpart E—Pay for Senior-Level and Scientific or Professional Positions SOURCE : 79 FR 12357, Mar. 5, 2014, unless otherwise noted. § 534.501 Purpose. This subpart provides rules for set- ting and adjusting rates of basic pay for senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) employees under 5 U.S.C. 5376. Section 5376, as amended by section 2 of the Senior Professional Performance Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110– 372, October 8, 2008), promotes perform-ance-based pay by enabling an agency that attains certification of a perform-ance appraisal system covering senior professionals to fix rates of basic pay for those employees up to the rate pay-able for level II of the Executive Sched-ule. Under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and subpart D of part 430 of this chapter, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) concurrence, grants certifi-cation only to a performance appraisal system that, in its design and applica-tion, makes meaningful distinctions based upon relative performance. This subpart implements the purpose of the law by providing for pay determina-tions for SL and ST employees to be based on individual performance, con-tributions to the agency’s performance, or both, as determined through admin-istration of the agency’s performance management system(s) for SL and ST employees. § 534.502 Coverage. (a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5376 and applies to— (1) Senior-level (SL) positions classi- fied above GS–15 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5108; and (2) Scientific or professional (ST) po- sitions established under 5 U.S.C. 3104. (b) This subpart does not apply to— (1) Senior Executive', 'take necessary pre- cautions to safeguard all OPFs. In the event of a lost or destroyed OPF, the current (or last, in the case of a former Federal employee) employing agency shall take the necessary action to re-construct the essential portions of the OPF as specified in the Guide to Per-sonnel Recordkeeping or other Office instructions.

All requests for their OPFs from former employees, and FOIA re-quests for former employee OPFs, shall be referred to the Office’s regional or area office nearest to the location of the requester. § 293.311 Availability of information. (a) The following information from both the OPF and employee perform-ance file system folders, their auto-mated equivalent records, and from other personnel record files that con-stitute an agency record within the meaning of the FOIA and which are under the control of the Office, about most present and former Federal em-ployees, is available to the public: (1) Name; (2) Present and past position titles and occupational series; (3) Present and past grades; (4) Present and past annual salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious or Distinguished Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials); (5) Present and past duty stations (includes room numbers, shop designa-tions, or other identifying information regarding buildings or places of em-ployment); and (6) Position descriptions, identifica- tion of job elements, and those per-formance standards (but not actual performance appraisals) that the re-lease of which would not interfere with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit agency effectiveness. Perform-ance elements and standards (or work expectations) may be withheld when they are so interwined with perform-ance appraisals that their disclosure would reveal an individual’s perform-ance appraisal. (b) The Office or agency will gen- erally not disclose information where the data sought is a list of names, present or past position titles, grades, salaries, performance standards, and/or duty stations of Federal employees which, as determined by the official re-sponsible for custody of the informa-tion: (1) Is selected in such a way that would reveal more about the employee on whom information is sought than the six enumerated items, the disclo-sure of which would constitute a clear-ly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR97 Office of Personnel Management § 293.402 (2) Would otherwise be protected from mandatory disclosure under an exemption of the FOIA.

This subpart applies to Executive agencies as defined in sections 105, 3132(a)(1) and 4301(1) of title 5, U.S. Code, including Military Departments (but not non-appropriated fund employ-ees) as defined in section 102 of title 5, U.S. Code, and independent establish-ments as defined in section 104 of title 5, U.S. Code. Within those agencies, the requirements of this subpart apply to all employees occupying positions sub-ject to civil service rules and regula-tions, including Senior Executive Serv-ice positions as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(2). § 293.402 Establishment of separate employee performance record sys-tem. (a) Copies of employees’ performance ratings of record, including the per-formance plans on which the ratings are based, must be placed in either the employee’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF) or in the Employee Performance File (EPF). However, other perform-ance-related documents may be re-tained in the OPF only when the agen-cy prescribes the use of a separate en-velope, temporarily located in the OPF, and removed whenever the OPF (except as required in §293.404(b)) is transferred to another agency. Per-formance ratings of record, including the performance plans on which the ratings are based, shall be retained on the left (temporary) side of the OPF. No other performance-related record shall be retained on the left (tem-porary) or right (long term) side of the OPF or shall be transferred to the Na-tional Personnel Records Center (ex-cept as required by §293.404(b)). (b) Except for performance records maintained in the OPF consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, each agency having employees occupying a position described in §293.401 shall pro-vide for maintenance of performance- related records for such employees in this EPF system. The agency may elect to retain records in a separate file that is located in the same office with the OPF, or in an envelope kept in the OPF itself. If the agency deter-mines that a separate EPF is cost-ef-fective, such a file may be located in another designated agency office (as specified in the agency’s performance appraisal plan) including with super-visors or managers (hereinafter re-ferred to as rating officials) or with Performance Review Boards. Any sup-porting documents that the agency may prescribe as necessary for agency officials in performance of their duties shall be kept in these files. (c)(1) Agencies shall provide their employees access to their performance files (automated and manual). Such a request for access shall be processed in accordance with established agency procedures, consistent with Office of Personnel Management regulations re-garding access to records contained in part 297 of this chapter. Such access shall be provided to the employee or to the employee’s designated representa-tive, and such records may also be dis-closed to other officials of the agency who have a need for the documents in the performance of their duties.

(d) Acquisition of competitive status. A person appointed under paragraph (a) of this section acquires competitive status automatically upon appoint-ment. (e) Tenure on appointment. An ap- pointment under paragraph (a) of this section is career-conditional unless the appointee has already satisfied the re-quirements for career tenure or is ex-empted from the service requirement pursuant to §315.201. [88 FR 84689, Dec. 6, 2023] § 315.614 Hiring Authority for College Graduates. (a) Appointment authority.

(b) Eligibility. An eligible college graduate is defined as an individual who: (1) Has received a baccalaureate or graduate degree from an institution of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1001(a); and (i) Has submitted an application for the position being filled under this au-thority (using the date on which the application is received by the hiring agency as the date of submission). (ii) Not later than two years after', '536.304.

(6) If employee is promoted from GS–1 or GS–2. In applying the promotion rule to an employee who is promoted from step 9 or 10 of grade GS–1 or GS–2, the value of two within-grade increases is deter-mined by doubling the within-grade in-crease between step 9 and 10 for the ap-plicable grade. (e) Temporary promotions. Pay is set for an employee receiving a temporary promotion on the same basis as a per-manent promotion. Upon expiration or termination of the temporary pro-motion, pay is set as provided in §531.215(c). If a temporary promotion is made permanent immediately after the temporary promotion ends, the agency may not return the employee to the lower grade; instead, the agency must convert the employee’s temporary pro-motion to a permanent promotion without a change in pay. (f) Corrections of demotions. The pro- motion rule in this section may not be used in correcting an erroneous demo-tion. (See §531.215(e).)

Except as otherwise pro- vided in this section, an employee who is demoted is entitled to the minimum payable rate of basic pay for the lower grade unless the agency sets the em-ployee’s pay at a higher rate under— (1) The grade and pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536, as applicable; or (2) The maximum payable rate rule in §531.221, as applicable. (b) Geographic conversion. If the em- ployee’s official worksite after demo-tion is in a different geographic loca-tion where different pay schedules apply, the agency must first convert the employee’s payable rate of pay as required by §531.205 before setting the demoted employee’s pay using the grade and pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536 or the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221. (c) Expiration or termination of a tem- porary promotion. (1) When an employee is returned to the lower grade from which promoted on expiration or ter-mination of a temporary promotion, the agency must set the employee’s payable rate of basic pay in the lower grade as if he or she had not been tem-porarily promoted, unless the agency sets pay at a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221. As provided in subpart D of this part, time during the temporary promotion may be creditable service towards GS within-grade increases in the lower grade.

When an employee promoted to a supervisory or managerial position does not satisfac-torily complete a probationary period established under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) and is returned to a position at the lower grade held before the promotion, the agency must set the employee’s pay-able rate of basic pay upon return to the lower grade as if the employee had not been promoted to the supervisory or managerial position, unless the agency sets pay at a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221. As provided in subpart D of this part, time served following the promotion may be creditable service towards GS within-grade increases in the lower grade. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits an agency from taking action against an em-ployee serving under a probationary period under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) for cause unrelated to supervisory or man-agerial performance and setting pay in accordance with such action. (e) Correcting an erroneous demotion. When a demotion is determined to be erroneous and is canceled, the agency must set the employee’s rate of basic pay as if the employee had not been de-moted. The action is a correction of the original demotion action and may not be treated as a promotion under §531.214. For example, when a demotion based on a reclassification of the em-ployee’s position is found to be erro-neous and is corrected retroactively under 5 CFR 511.703, the corrective ac-tion is cancellation of the original de-motion.

This section governs the setting of pay for an employee who moves to a GS position in the Depart-ment of Defense or the Coast Guard from a position in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) (as de-scribed in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) of the De-partment of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, without a break in service of more than 3 days. If an em-ployee moves from a NAFI position to a GS position with a break of more than 3 days or moves from a NAFI posi-tion in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard to a GS position out-side of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, the em-ployee has no special conversion rights and this section does not apply. (b) NAFI highest previous rate. For the purpose of this section, the term ‘‘NAFI highest previous rate’’ means the highest rate of basic pay received by an employee during service in a NAFI position, as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c). (c) Voluntary move. (1) For a Depart- ment of Defense or Coast Guard em-ployee who moves voluntarily, without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a NAFI position in the Depart-ment of Defense or the Coast Guard to a GS position in the Department of De-fense or the Coast Guard, respectively, the agency may set the employee’s ini-tial payable rate of basic pay at the lowest step rate in the highest applica-ble rate range currently in effect for the employee’s GS position of record and official worksite which equals or exceeds the employee’s NAFI highest previous rate of pay, or any lower step rate, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section.

The question targets a specific and nuanced area of federal employment policy that has significant implications for both SES employees and HR professionals. 

The query is particularly useful because:
1. It focuses on a unique compensation category for high-level federal executives
2. Addresses potential complexities around premium pay and compensatory time for SES members
3. Requires understanding of specific regulatory restrictions that are not immediately obvious to most employees
4. Has direct practical applications for compensation management and compliance
5. Would be valuable for HR specialists, SES members, and managers involved in executive-level workforce planning

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the intricate compensation rules that apply to senior federal executives, going beyond basic pay regulations to explore specific limitations on additional compensation and time off. This level of specificity makes it an extremely valuable inquiry for anyone seeking to understand the detailed compensation framework for top-tier federal employees."

OPM obtains from the shel- ter survey, a survey of Federal employ-ees, or other appropriate sources, infor-mation on dwelling size and the types and prevalence of heating and cooling equipment and energy types (e.g., elec-tricity, gas, and oil) in each area. (3) Step 3. OPM computes estimates of total home energy requirements by en-ergy type attributable to heating and cooling plus all other household energy uses for the COLA survey area and the Washington, DC, area. (4) Step 4. OPM surveys utility prices for each major energy type appropriate to the area. (5) Step 5. OPM combines the above data to produce for each COLA survey area the cost of maintaining the stand-ard size dwelling at a given ambient temperature and the cost of other household energy uses. (6) Step 6. OPM compares the COLA survey area cost with the DC area cost to produce a price index. § 591.221 How does OPM compute the consumer expenditure weights it uses to combine price indexes? OPM uses the following ten-step process to compute consumer expendi-ture weights: (a) Step 1. OPM obtains the latest BLS tabulated CES data nationwide and for the Washington, DC, area. (b) Step 2. In both the nationwide and DC area tabulated data, OPM replaces the homeowners’ expenditures for shel-ter with estimated rental values of owned homes that are available else-where in tabulated CES data. Note: These replacements are consistent with the rental equivalence approach de-scribed in §591.219. (c) Step 3. OPM selects the central in- come groups in the nationwide CES tabulation. (d) Step 4. OPM calculates the ex- penditure shares ( i.e., percentages) for each central income group by dividing each of its DEC expenditures by total expenditures for the income group. OPM also calculates expenditure shares for total nationwide expenditures by dividing each nationwide DEC expendi-ture by total nationwide expenditures. (e) Step 5. OPM computes a demo- cratic distribution of expenditure shares by averaging the central income groups’ shares at each DEC and higher level of aggregation. (f) Step 6. OPM computes a set of ra- tios by dividing each expenditure share of the nationwide democratic distribu-tion by the corresponding expenditure share of the total national distribu-tion. (g) Step 7. OPM computes estimated expenditures for Washington DC for each DC DEC and higher level of aggre-gation that BLS reported by multi-plying the reported expenditure by the corresponding ratio derived in Step 6. (h) Step 8. For each DC DEC and high- er level of aggregation that BLS did not report, OPM computes expendi-tures for DC by distributing the DC ex-penditure calculated in step 7 using the distribution of expenditure shares de-rived in step 5. (i) Step 9. As described in §591.211(c), OPM classifies each DEC and aggregate into PEGs. (j) Step 10. OPM computes expendi- ture weights by dividing each DEC or aggregate by the total expenditure de-rived from the DC expenditure com-puted in step 8. Therefore, the sum of the MEGs, PEGs, and DECs, will sepa-rately total 100, i.e., so that all con- sumer expenditures in the original tab- ulation are accounted for. § 591.222 How does OPM use the ex- penditure weights to combine price indexes? OPM uses a three-step process to combine price indexes. (a) Step 1. For each DEC represented by one or more items for which OPM could make valid price comparisons (e.g., OPM was able to collect rep-resentative prices in both the COLA and DC areas), OPM computes the unweighted geometric average (the nth root of the product of n numbers) of the price index(es) of all item(s) rep-resenting the DEC. (b) Step 2. OPM multiplies the price index for each DEC by its expenditure weight, sums the cross products, and divides by the sum of the weights used in the calculation. This produces a price index for the level of aggregation (e.g., PEG or sub-PEG) in which the DEC is categorized.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 591.223 (c) Step 3. OPM repeats the process described in Step 2 at each level of ag-gregation within the PEG to produce a price index for the PEG, at the PEG level to produce an index for the MEG, and at the MEG level to produce the overall price index for the COLA area. [67 FR 22340, May 3, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 59763, Oct. 6, 2004] § 591.223 When does OPM conduct COLA surveys? (a) OPM conducts a survey in each COLA area once every 3 years on a ro-tational basis and surveys the Wash-ington, DC, area concurrently with each COLA area survey. The order of the COLA area surveys is as follows: (1) Year 1. All COLA areas in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (2) Year 2. All COLA areas in the State of Alaska, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (3) Year 3. All COLA areas in the State of Hawaii and the Territory of Guam and CNMI. (b) Exceptions: (1) Nothing in this subpart precludes OPM from conducting interim surveys or implementing some other change in response to conditions caused by a nat-ural disaster or similar emergency, provided OPM publishes a notice or rule in the F EDERAL REGISTER explain- ing the change and the reason(s) for it. (2) As provided in §591.215(c), OPM does not conduct surveys in the Rest of the State of Alaska COLA area unless COLA rate reductions appear war-ranted. § 591.224 How does OPM adjust price indexes between surveys? (a) OPM adjusts price indexes be- tween the triennial surveys in each COLA area that is not surveyed in that year. To do this, OPM uses the annual or biennial change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the COLA area relative to the annual or biennial change in the CPI for the Washington, DC, area. OPM uses the annual change for those areas surveyed the preceding year. OPM uses the biennial change for those areas surveyed 2 years before.

Time spent at a temporary duty sta-tion between arrival and departure is not time in a travel status. Time in a travel status ends when the employee arrives at the temporary duty worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty station, wherever the employee arrives first. Time in a travel status re-sumes when an employee departs from the temporary duty worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty sta-tion, from whichever the employee de-parts last. Travel time in connection with an employee’s permanent change of station is not time in a travel sta-tus. Determinations regarding what is creditable as ‘‘usual waiting time’’ are within the sole and exclusive discretion of the employing agency. (2) If an employee experiences an ex- tended ( i.e., not usual) waiting time be- tween actual periods of travel during which the employee is free to rest, sleep, or otherwise use the time for his or her own purposes, the extended waiting time is not creditable as time in a travel status. (c) Travel between home and a tem- porary duty station. (1) If an employee is required to travel directly between his or her home and a temporary duty sta-tion outside the limits of the employ-ee’s official duty station, the travel time is creditable as time in a travel status if otherwise qualifying under this subpart. However, the agency must deduct from such travel hours the time the employee would have spent in normal home-to-work or work-to-home commuting. (2) In the case of an employee who is offered one mode of transportation and who is permitted to use an alternative mode of transportation, or who travels at a time or by a route other than that selected by the agency, the agency must determine the estimated amount of time in a travel status the employee would have had if the employee had used the mode of transportation offered by the agency or traveled at the time or by the route selected by the agency. In determining time in a travel status under this subpart, the agency must credit the employee with the lesser of the estimated time in a travel status or the actual time in a travel status. (3) In the case of an employee who is on a multiple-day travel assignment and who chooses, for personal reasons, not to use temporary lodgings at the temporary duty station, but to return home at night or on a weekend, only travel from home to the temporary duty station on the 1st day and travel from the temporary duty station to home on the last day that is otherwise qualifying as time in a travel status under this subpart is mandatorily cred-itable (subject to the deduction of nor-mal commuting time). Travel to and from home on other days is not cred-itable travel time unless the agency, at its discretion, determines that credit should be given based on the net sav-ings to the Government from reduced lodging costs, considering the value of lost labor time attributable to compen-satory time off. The dollar value of an hour of compensatory time off for this purpose is equal to the employee’s hourly rate of basic pay as defined in §550.103. (d) Time spent traveling to or from a transportation terminal as part of travel away from the official duty station. If an employee is required to travel between home and a transportation terminal (e.g., airport or train station) within the limits of his or her official duty station as part of travel away from that duty station, the travel time out-side regular working hours to or from the terminal is considered to be equiv-alent to commuting time and is not creditable time in a travel status. If the transportation terminal is outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station, the travel time to or from the terminal outside regular working hours is creditable as time in a travel status, but is subject to an off-set for the time the employee would have spent in normal home-to-work or work-to-home commuting. If the em-ployee travels between a worksite and a transportation terminal, the travel time outside regular working hours is creditable as time in a travel status, and no commuting time offset applies. (e) Travel involving two or more time zones. When an employee’s travel in- volves two or more time zones, the time zone from the point of first depar-ture must be used to determine how many hours the employee actually VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00681 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR672 5 CFR Ch.

(a) Upon a request filed in accordance with the procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section, an em-ployee is entitled to credit for compen-satory time off for travel under the conditions specified in this subpart. The employing agency must credit an employee with compensatory time off for creditable time in a travel status as provided in §550.1404. The agency may authorize credit in increments of one- tenth of an hour (6 minutes) or one- quarter of an hour (15 minutes). Agen-cies must track and manage compen-satory time off granted under this sub-part separately from other forms of compensatory time off. (b) An employee must comply with his or her agency’s procedures for re-questing credit of compensatory time off under this section. Employees must file such requests within the time pe-riod required by the agency.

(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5307(d), as added by section 1322 of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 (Title XIII of Public Law 107–296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002; No-vember 25, 2002), which provides a high-er aggregate limitation on pay for cer-tain members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5383 and employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) posi-tions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. In addi-tion, this subpart is necessary to ad-minister rates of basic pay for mem-bers of the SES under 5 U.S.C. 5382, as amended by section 1125 of the Na- tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The regulations in this subpart strengthen the application of pay-for-performance principles to senior executives and senior profes-sionals. Specifically, the statutory pro-visions authorize an agency to apply a higher maximum rate of basic pay for senior executives (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effec-tive) and apply a higher aggregate lim-itation on pay (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B) to its senior em-ployees, but only after OPM, with OMB concurrence, has certified that the de-sign and application of the agency’s ap-praisal systems for these employees make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. This subpart es-tablishes the certification criteria and procedures that OPM will apply in con-sidering agency requests for such cer-tification. (b) Senior executives generally may receive an annual rate of basic pay up to the rate for level III of the Execu-tive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effec-tive. Senior employees generally may receive total compensation in a cal-endar year up to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C.

Before author- izing student loan repayment benefits for an employee (or job candidate), an agency must make a written deter-mination that— (1) The employee (or job candidate) is highly qualified and otherwise eligible (as described in §537.104); and (2)(i) In a case where the authoriza- tion is granted to recruit a job can-didate to fill an agency position, the agency otherwise would encounter dif-ficulty in filling a position with a high-ly qualified individual; or (ii) In a case where the authorization is granted to retain a current employee of the agency, the employee otherwise is likely to leave the agency for em-ployment outside the Federal service and it is essential to retain the em-ployee based on the employee’s high or unique qualifications or a special need of the agency. (b) Retention considerations. In mak- ing a determination under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, an agency must consider the extent to which the employee’s departure would affect the agency’s ability to carry out an activ-ity or perform a function that is deemed essential to its mission. (c) Current Federal employees. An agency may not authorize student loan repayment benefits to recruit an indi-vidual from outside the agency who is currently employed in the Federal service. (d) Selection. When selecting employ- ees (or job candidates) to receive stu-dent loan repayment benefits, agencies must ensure that benefits are awarded without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as de-fined by the Age Discrimination in Em-ployment Act of 1967, as amended), dis-ability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital sta-tus, political affiliation, sexual ori-entation, labor affiliation or nonaffili- ation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, unless specifi-cally designated by statute as a factor that must be taken into consideration when awarding such benefits, or retal-iation for exercising rights with re-spect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available.

(1) Student loan repayment benefits may be pro-vided at the discretion of the agency and are subject to such terms, limita-tions, or conditions as may be mutu-ally agreed to in writing by the agency and the employee (or job candidate) as part of a service agreement under §537.107. (2) The student loan to be repaid must be a qualifying student loan as set forth in paragraph (b) of this sec-tion. (3) The agency must document in writing each approval of student loan repayment benefits. An authorized agency official must review and ap-prove each written determination. The written determination must show the employee (or job candidate) meets the criteria specified in §537.105. (4) An authorized agency official must approve student loan repayment benefits in connection with a recruit-ment action before the job candidate actually enters on duty in the position for which he or she was recruited. The agency and the job candidate may sign the service agreement consistent with §537.107 before the job candidate begins serving in the position, but the agency may not begin making loan payments until the job candidate begins serving in the position. (5) Student loan repayment benefits are in addition to basic pay and any other form of compensation otherwise payable to the employee involved.

NOTE TO §537.106(a)(6): Contact the Internal Revenue Service for further details con-cerning these options, as well as the tax withholding implications of payments under this part. (b) Qualifying student loans. (1) The agency may make loan payments only for student loan debts that are out-standing at the time the agency and the employee (or job candidate) enter into a service agreement. Before au-thorizing loan payments, an agency must verify with the holder of the loan that the employee (or job candidate) has an outstanding student loan that qualifies for repayment under this part. The agency must verify remain-ing balances to ensure that loans are not overpaid. (2) The agency may repay more than one loan if the employee’s student loan repayment benefit does not exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

The question addresses a critical administrative requirement that impacts multiple stakeholders:

1. HR Specialists: They need precise guidance on document retention periods to ensure compliance with federal records management regulations and potential future reference for performance reviews, promotions, or legal considerations.

2. Managers: Understanding document retention helps them maintain proper personnel records and know how long performance documentation remains part of an employee's official record.

3. Federal Employees: Employees have a legitimate interest in knowing how long their performance ratings are maintained, which could be relevant for future career opportunities, appeals, or understanding their professional documentation lifecycle.

The question is specific, focused, and seeks concrete information about a procedural aspect of performance management that is fundamental to federal employment practices. It demonstrates a clear, practical information need that has direct implications for organizational record-keeping, compliance, and personnel management.

The query is concise yet comprehensive, seeking a specific regulatory detail that is crucial for proper federal employment documentation practices. Its broad applicability across different federal agencies and employee levels makes it particularly valuable."
 Are there any special provisions for employees of the Veterans Health Administration or teachers regarding family and medical leave?," Yes, the policy specifies that:
- Employees of the Veterans Health Administration appointed under title 38, United States Code, in occupations listed in 38 U.S.C. 7401(1) are governed by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
- Teachers or individuals holding teaching positions are governed by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.
These special provisions mean that these specific employee groups may have different terms and conditions for family and medical leave compared to other federal employees.","['tions 6381 through 6387 of title 5, United States Code— VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00890 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR881 Office of Personnel Management § 630.1202 (i) An employee of the Veterans Health Administration appointed under title 38, United States Code, in occupa-tions listed in 38 U.S.C. 7401(1) is be governed by the terms and conditions of regulations prescribed by the Sec-retary of Veterans Affairs; (ii) A ‘‘teacher’’ or an individual holding a ‘‘teaching position,’’ as de-fined in section 901 of title 20, United States Code, shall be governed by the terms and conditions of regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense; and (iii) An employee identified in sec- tion 2105(c) of title 5, United States Code, who is paid from nonappropriated funds shall be governed by the terms and conditions of regulations pre-scribed by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate.

This subpart contains OPM regula- tions implementing 5 U.S.C. 5550b, which establishes a separate type of compensatory time off. Subject to the conditions specified in this subpart, an employee is entitled to earn, on an hour-for-hour basis, compensatory time off for time in a travel status away from the employee’s official duty station when the travel time is not otherwise compensable. [70 FR 3856, Jan. 27, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 19098, Apr. 17, 2007] § 550.1402 Coverage. This subpart applies to an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5541(2) who is em-ployed by an agency. In accordance with section 1111 of Public Law 110–181, an employee whose pay is fixed and ad-justed from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates under subchapter IV of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, or by a wage board or similar administrative authority serv-ing the same purpose, is covered by this subpart effective April 27, 2008. [73 FR 30455, May 28, 2008] § 550.1403 Definitions. In this subpart: Accrued compensatory time off means the compensatory time off earned by an employee that has not been used or forfeited. Agency means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. Authorized agency official means the head of the agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned. Compensable refers to periods of time that are creditable as hours of work for the purpose of determining a specific pay entitlement, even when that work time may not actually generate addi-tional compensation because of appli-cable pay limitations. Compensatory time off means compen- satory time off for travel that is cred-ited under the authority of this sub-part. Official duty station means the geo- graphic area surrounding an employ-ee’s regular work site that is the same as the area designated by the employ-ing agency for the purpose of deter-mining whether travel time is compen-sable for the purpose of determining overtime pay, consistent with the regu-lations in 5 CFR 550.112(j) and 551.422(d). Regular working hours means the days and hours of an employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek es-tablished under 5 CFR part 610. Scheduled tour of duty for leave pur- poses means an employee’s regular hours for which he or she may be charged leave under 5 CFR part 630 when absent. For full-time employees, it is the 40-hour basic workweek as de-fined in 5 CFR 610.102. For employees with an uncommon tour of duty as de-fined in 5 CFR 630.201, it is the uncom-mon tour of duty. Travel means officially authorized travel— i.e., travel for work purposes that is approved by an authorized agen-cy official or otherwise authorized under established agency policies. Time spent traveling in connection with union activities is excluded. Travel status means travel time as de- scribed in §550.1404 that is creditable in accruing compensatory time off for travel under this subpart, excluding travel time that is otherwise compen-sable under other legal authority.

Subject to the conditions specified in this subpart, an agency must credit an employee with compen-satory time off for time in a travel sta-tus if— (1) The employee is required to travel away from the official duty station; and (2) The travel time is not otherwise compensable hours of work under other legal authority. (b)(1) Travel status. Time in a travel status includes the time an employee actually spends traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station, or between two tem-porary duty stations, and the usual waiting time that precedes or inter-rupts such travel, subject to the exclu-sion specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00680 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR671 Office of Personnel Management § 550.1404 section and the requirements in para- graph (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

(b) An individual may be represented by another party when requesting amendment of records. (c) A request for amendment should include the following: (1) The precise identification of the records to be amended; (2) The identification of the specific material to be deleted, added, or changed; and (3) A statement of the reasons for the request, including all available mate-rial substantiating the request. (d) Requests for amendment of records should include the words ‘‘PRIVACY ACT AMENDMENT RE-QUEST’’ in capital letters on both the envelope and at the top of the request letter.

This timeframe begins when the re-quest is received by the proper Office or agency official. § 297.303 Applicability of amendment provisions. (a) The amendment procedures are not intended to allow a challenge to material that records an event that ac-tually occurred nor are they designed to permit a collateral attack upon that which has been or could have been the subject of a judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceeding. The amend-ment procedures are also not designed to change opinions in records per-taining to the individual. (b) The amendment procedures apply to situations when an occurrence that is documented was challenged through an established judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative procedure and found to be inaccurately described; when the document is not identical to the indi-vidual’s copy; or when the document is not created in accordance with the ap-plicable recordkeeping requirements.

Subpart D—Types of Positions § 214.401 Types of positions. There are two types of positions in the Senior Executive Service: (a) General positions, which may be filled by a career, noncareer, limited emergency, or limited term appointee. (b) Career reserved positions, which may be filled only by a career ap-pointee. § 214.402 Career reserved positions. (a) The head of each agency is re- sponsible for designating career re-served positions in accordance with the regulations in this section. (b) A position shall be designated as a career reserved position if: (1) The position (except a position in the Executive Office of the President): (i) Was under the Executive Sched- ule, or the rate of basic pay was deter-mined by reference to the Executive Schedule, on October 12, 1978; (ii) Was specifically required under section 2102 of title 5, United States Code, or otherwise required by law to be in the competitive service; and (iii) Entailed direct responsibility to the public for the management or oper-ation of particular government pro-grams or functions; or (2) The position must be filled by a career appointee to ensure impar-tiality, or the public’s confidence in the impartiality, of the Government.

(ii) Other positions requiring impar- tiality, or the public’s confidence in impartiality, as determined by an agency in light of its mission. (d) The Office of Personnel Manage- ment may review agency designations of general and career reserved posi-tions. If the Office finds that an agency has designated any position as general that should be career reserved, it shall direct the agency to make the career reserved designation. (e) The minimum number of posi- tions in the Senior Executive Service Governmentwide that must be career reserved is 3,571 as determined by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under section 3133(e) of 5 U.S.C.

It addresses a specific aspect of family and medical leave (FMLA) that may have unique provisions for certain federal employee groups. The question demonstrates a nuanced information need about potential variations in leave policies for specialized federal workforce segments.

The question is particularly useful because:
1. It targets a specific subset of federal employees (VHA workers and teachers)
2. Seeks clarification on potential special leave provisions
3. Indicates a genuine need to understand potential policy variations
4. Would help employees and HR professionals understand their specific leave rights
5. Relates directly to Title 5 regulations concerning employee benefits and leave

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it's somewhat narrow in scope, focusing on two specific employee groups. However, it still represents a substantive and practical inquiry that could significantly impact individual employees' understanding of their leave entitlements."
" Under what circumstances can an employee with a disability from uniformed service be reemployed, and what are the agency's obligations?
"," An employee with a disability incurred or aggravated during uniformed service is entitled to:
- Reasonable efforts by the agency to accommodate the disability
- Placement in another position for which they are qualified that provides:
  1. Same seniority
  2. Same status
  3. Same pay (or the nearest approximation)

However, the agency is not required to reemploy the disabled employee if such reemployment would impose an undue hardship on the agency, even after making due efforts to accommodate the disability.","['or she would have attained if continu-ously employed. If not qualified for this position after reasonable efforts by the agency to qualify the employee, he or she is entitled to be placed in the po-sition he or she left. For service of 91 days or more, the agency has the op-tion of placing the employee in a posi-tion of like seniority, status, and pay. (N OTE: Upon reemployment, a term em- ployee completes the unexpired portion of his or her original appointment.) If unqualified (for any reason other than disability incurred in or aggravated during service in the uniformed serv-ices) after reasonable efforts by the agency to qualify the employee for such position or the position the em-ployee left, he or she must be restored to any other position of lesser status and pay for which qualified, with full seniority. (c) Disabled. An employee with a dis- ability incurred in or aggravated dur-ing uniformed service and who, after reasonable efforts by the agency to ac-commodate the disability, is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same seniority, sta-tus, and pay, or the nearest approxima-tion consistent with the circumstances in each case. The agency is not re- quired to reemploy a disabled employee if, after making due efforts to accom-modate the disability, such reemploy-ment would impose an undue hardship on the agency. (d) Two or more persons entitled to res- toration in the same position. If two or more persons are entitled to restora-tion in the same position, the one who left the position first has the prior right to restoration in that position. The other employee(s) is entitled to be placed in a position as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. (e) Relationship to an entitlement based on veterans’ preference. An employee’s right to restoration under this part does not entitle the person to reten-tion, preference, or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim based on veterans’ preference. § 353.208 Use of paid time off during uniformed service. An employee performing service with the uniformed services must be per-mitted, upon request, to use any ac-crued annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304, military leave under 5 U.S.C. 6323, earned compensatory time off for trav-el under 5 U.S.C. 5550b, or sick leave under 5 U.S.C. 6307, if appropriate, dur-ing such service.

VETS staff will attempt to resolve employment dis-putes brought to investigate. If dispute resolution proves unsuccessful, VETS will, at the request of the employee, refer the matter to the Office of the Special Counsel for representation be-fore the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

An individual who believes an agency has not complied with the provisions of law and this part relating to the em-ployment or reemployment of the per-son by the agency may— (a) File a complaint with the Depart- ment of Labor, as noted in §353.210, or (b) Appeal directly to MSPB if the in- dividual chooses not to file a complaint with the Department of Labor, or is in-formed by either Labor or the Office of the Special Counsel that they will not pursue to the case.

[60 FR 45652, Sept. 1, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999] Subpart C—Compensable Injury § 353.301 Restoration rights. (a) Fully recovered within 1 year. An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence be-gins after the employee resumes reg- ular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be re-stored immediately and uncondition-ally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these res-toration rights are agencywide, the employee’s basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to dis-place an employee occupying a con-tinuing position under temporary ap-pointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local com-muting area, the agency must offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This para-graph also applies when an injured em-ployee accepts a lower-grade position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers. A fully recovered em-ployee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation. (b) Fully recovered after 1 year. An em- ployee who separated because of a com- pensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consider-ation, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equiva-lent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency’s reem-ployment priority list', 'rate is the payable rate of basic pay upon promotion. (4) Alternate method. (i) The alternate method of applying the promotion rule, which involves using pay schedules ap-plicable before promotion and then converting pay to a different schedule applicable after promotion, is pre-sented in the following table: Promotion Rule—Alternate Method Steps A, B, C Same as standard method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Step D Identify the highest applicable rate range for the employee’s grade after promotion based on con-sideration of any pay schedule that applied to the employee’s position of record before promotion (after any geographic conversion). (Do not con-sider pay schedules that apply only to the em-ployee’s new position of record after promotion. For example, if a particular special rate schedule applies only to an employee’s position of record after promotion, disregard that schedule in apply-ing this step.) Find the lowest step in the highest applicable rate range that equals or exceeds the rate identified in step C. (If the rate identified in step C exceeds the maximum of the rate range identified in this step, the employee’s payable rate is that maximum rate, or, if the employee’s existing rate is higher than that maximum rate, a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536 equal to that existing rate.) Step E Convert the lowest step rate identified in step D to a corresponding step rate (same step) in the high-est applicable rate range for the employee’s new position of record after promotion. This is the em-ployee’s alternate payable rate of basic pay upon promotion. (If the rate derived under step D was a retained rate, determine the alternate payable rate of basic pay as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.) Step F If the alternate payable rate identified in step E ex- ceeds the payable rate resulting from the stand-ard method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the employee is entitled to the alternate rate upon promotion. Otherwise, the employee is entitled to the payable rate derived under the standard method, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. (ii) In applying step E of the table in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, if the rate derived under step D was a re-tained rate, compare the retained rate to the highest applicable rate range identified in step E. If the retained rate exceeds the maximum of that rate range, the retained rate continues and is the employee’s alternate payable rate upon promotion. If the retained rate is below the rate range maximum, the employee’s alternate payable rate upon promotion is the maximum rate of the range (step 10). (iii) Example of alternate method: A GS–7, step 7, employee in Atlanta is promoted to a GS–9 position in Wash-ington, DC. The promotion involves not only a change in grade but also a change in the employee’s occupational series. In Washington, DC, no special rate schedule would apply to a GS–7 or GS–9 position in the old occupational series, but a special rate schedule does apply to the GS–9 position in the new occupational series. Thus, different pay schedules apply before and after pro-motion, and the alternate method would result in a higher rate than the standard method. As provided in para-graph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the agency must apply the alternate meth-od and compare the result to the result derived under the standard method, as follows: Step A Apply the geographic conversion rule in § 531.205 to determine the rates of basic pay for the GS–7, step 7, position in Washington, DC. Based on the GS–7 position before promotion (including the old occupational series), the pay schedules applica-ble to the employee in Washington, DC, would be the General Schedule and the locality rate sched-ule applicable in Washington, DC. Step B Using the underlying General Schedule, increase the GS–7, step 7, rate by two within-grade in-creases, which produces the GS–7, step 9, rate. Step C The payable (highest) rate of basic pay for GS–7, step 9, is the corresponding GS–7, step 9, locality rate in Washington, DC.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 531.215 Step D If the employee were promoted to a GS–9 position in the old occupational series, the highest appli-cable rate range for that GS–9 position after pro-motion would be the GS–9 locality rate range in Washington, DC. The GS–9, step 3, locality rate is the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the GS–7, step 9, locality rate from step C. Step E Convert the GS–9, step 3, locality rate to the higher GS–9, step 3, special rate that applies to the em-ployee’s position after promotion (including the new occupational series). That GS–9, step 3, special rate is the payable rate of basic pay upon promotion. Step F Assume that the standard method would have com- pared the GS–7, step 9, locality rate directly to the higher GS–9 range of special rates and pro-duced a rate of GS–9, step 1. Since the rate pro-duced by the alternate method (GS–9, step 3) is greater than the rate produced by the standard method, the result of the alternate method is used. (5) If employee was receiving a retained rate before promotion. (i) If an employ- ee’s existing payable rate of basic pay before promotion is a retained rate, apply the applicable promotion meth-ods in paragraphs (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section as if the employee were receiv-ing the maximum rate of the employ-ee’s grade before promotion. (ii) If the payable rate of basic pay after promotion determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section is greater than the employee’s existing retained rate, the employee is entitled to that payable rate. (iii) If the existing retained rate is greater than the rate determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the retained rate must be compared to the highest applicable rate range for the position after promotion, as provided in 5 CFR 536.304. The employee is enti-tled to the lowest step rate in the range that equals or exceeds the re-tained rate or, if the retained rate ex-ceeds the range maximum, to the re-tained rate. (6) If employee is promoted from GS–1 or GS–2. In applying the promotion rule to an employee who is promoted from step 9 or 10 of grade GS–1 or GS–2, the value of two within-grade increases is deter-mined by doubling the within-grade in-crease between step 9 and 10 for the ap-plicable grade.

Associate Directors and Regional Directors are authorized to settle and pay any claim not exceeding $500 and arising under this part. The General Counsel is authorized to settle and pay any claim not exceeding $15,000 and arising under this part. Unless cog-nizable under §180.104(c)(3), claims for damage to or loss of motor vehicles may be settled and paid only by the General Counsel. (b) Redelegation. The approving au- thorities may establish such proce-dures and make such redelegations as may be required to fulfill the objec-tives of this part. (c) Cost or value. The amount awarded on any item of property will not exceed the cost of the item (either the price paid in cash or property) or the value at the time of acquisition if not ac-quired by purchase or exchange. The amount payable will be determined by applying the principles of depreciation to the adjusted dollar value or other base price of property lost or damaged beyond economical repair; by allowing the cost of repairs when an item is eco-nomically repairable, provided the cost of repairs does not exceed the depre-ciated value of the item; and by de-ducting salvage value, if appropriate. (d) Depreciation. Depreciation in value of an item is determined by con-sidering the type of article involved, its cost, condition when damaged be-yond economical repair or lost, and the time elapsed between the date of acqui-sition and the date of damage or loss. (e) Appreciation. There will be no al- lowance for appreciation in the value of the property except that the cost of the item may be adjusted to reflect changes in the purchasing power of the dollar before depreciation is computed. Appreciation will not be allowed solely because the loss occurred or the claim-ant now resides in an area remote from the place of purchase of the property. (f) Expensive articles. Allowance for expensive items (including heirlooms and antiques) or for items purchased at unreasonably high prices will be based on the fair and reasonable purchase price for substitute articles of a simi-lar nature. (g) Acquisition. Allowance for articles acquired by barter will not exceed the cost of the articles tendered in barter. No reimbursement will be made for ar-ticles acquired in black market or other prohibited activities. (h) Replacement. Replacement of dam- aged or lost property may be made in kind whenever appropriate. (i) Amount allowable. Subject to the limitations of §§180.108(c) through 180.108(h), the amount allowable in set-tlement of a claim is either: (1) The depreciated value imme- diately prior to damage or loss of prop-erty damaged beyond economical re-pair or lost, less any salvage value; or (2) The reasonable cost of repairs when property is economically repair-able, provided that the cost of repairs does not exceed the depreciated value. (j) Notification. The approving author- ity shall notify the claimant in writing of the action taken on the claim and, if', 'night shift differential for any leave with pay taken when scheduled to work night shifts. (3) An employee assigned to a regular rotating schedule involving work on both day and night shifts shall be paid a night shift differential only for any leave with pay taken when scheduled to work night shifts. (4) An employee who is not regularly assigned to a day shift or a night shift but whose shift is changed at irregular intervals shall be paid a night shift dif-ferential during leave with pay if the employee received a night shift dif-ferential for the last shift worked pre-ceding leave with pay. § 532.507 Pay for holiday work. (a) An employee who is entitled to holiday premium pay and who performs work on a holiday which is not over-time work shall be paid the employee’s rate of basic pay plus premium pay at a rate equal to the rate of basic pay. (b) An employee shall be paid for overtime work performed on a holiday at the same rate as for overtime on other workdays. (c) An employee who is entitled to holiday premium pay and who is re-quired to report for work on a holiday shall be paid at least two hours of holi-day pay whether or not work is actu-ally performed. § 532.509 Pay for Sunday work. A wage employee whose regular work schedule includes a period of service of up to 8 hours which is not overtime work, a part of which is on Sunday, is entitled to additional pay under the provisions of section 5544 of title 5, United States Code. [76 FR 52539, Aug. 23, 2011] § 532.511 Environmental differentials. (a) Entitlements to environmental dif- ferential pay. (1) In accordance with section 5343(c)(4) of title 5, United States Code, an employee shall be paid an environmental differential when ex-posed to a working condition or hazard that falls within one of the categories approved by the Office of Personnel Management. (2) Each installation or activity must evaluate its situations against the guidelines issued by the Office of Per-sonnel Management to determine whether the local situation is covered by one or more of the defined cat-egories. (b) Amount of environmental differen- tial payable. (1) An employee entitled to an environmental differential shall be paid an amount equal to the percent-age rate authorized by the Office of Personnel Management for the cat-egory in which the working condition or hazard falls, multiplied by the rate for the second step of WG–10 for the ap-propriated fund employees and NA–10 for the nonappropriated fund employ-ees on the current regular non-super-visory wage schedule for the wage area for which the differential is payable, counting one-half cent and over as a whole cent. (2) An employee entitled to an envi- ronmental differential on an actual ex-posure basis shall be paid a minimum of one hour’s differential pay for the exposure. For exposure beyond one hour, the employee shall be paid in in-crements of one quarter hour for each 15 minutes or portion thereof in excess of 15 minutes. Entitlement begins with the first instance of exposure and ends one hour later, except that when expo-sure continues beyond the hour, it shall be considered ended at the end of the quarter hour in which exposure ac-tually terminated. (3) An employee entitled to an envi- ronmental differential on the basis of hours in a pay status shall be paid for all hours in a pay status on the day on which he/she is exposed to the situa-tion. (4) An employee may not be paid more than one environmental differen-tial for a particular period of work. (5) The payment of environmental differential pay is computed on the basis of the highest environmental dif-ferential rate authorized during the pe-riod of entitlement. (6) The number of hours an employee is paid environmental differential shall not exceed the number of hours of duty performed by the employee on the day of exposure except as required by para-graph (b)(3) of this section.

The question touches on critical aspects of federal employment law that directly impact:

1. Disabled veterans' employment rights
2. Agency responsibilities in reemployment
3. Reasonable accommodations for service-connected disabilities
4. Protections for those who have served in uniformed services

The question is practical because it addresses a real and important scenario faced by many federal employees who are veterans. It requires understanding complex legal obligations and rights, which is crucial for HR specialists, managers, and the employees themselves. The information sought is substantive and would help stakeholders ensure proper compliance with federal employment regulations and support those who have served in the military.

The broad scope of the question allows for a comprehensive exploration of reemployment rights, potential accommodations, and the specific circumstances under which disabled service members can be reinstated in their federal positions. This makes it extremely useful for anyone involved in federal employment, particularly those dealing with veterans' employment issues."
 What administrative safeguards must federal agencies implement to protect personnel records?," According to §293.106, agencies must establish administrative, technical, and physical controls to protect personnel records from unauthorized access, modification, destruction, or disclosure. Minimum requirements include:
1. Ensuring only employees with official duties can access records
2. Storing records in locked metal filing cabinets or secured rooms
3. Documenting removal of records from storage areas
4. Limiting entry into personnel record storage areas
5. Disposing of records in accordance with General Services Administration schedules","['paying agency —(1) Complete claim.

(c) Services rendered under this sec- tion will be provided on a fully reim-bursable basis pursuant to the Econ-omy Act of 1932, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 1535. § 179.217 Non-waiver of rights by pay- ments. An employee’s involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt collected under this subpart must not be con-strued as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary. § 179.218 Additional administrative collection action.

C OST-OF-LIVING ALLOWANCES § 591.206 How does OPM establish COLA areas? (a) OPM designates, within nonfor- eign areas, areas where agencies pay employees a COLA by virtue of living costs that are substantially higher than those in the Washington, DC, area. In establishing the boundaries of COLA areas, OPM considers— (1) The existence of a well-defined economic community, (2) The availability of consumer goods and services, (3) The concentration of Federal em- ployees covered by this subpart, and (4) Unique circumstances related to a specific location. (b) If a department or agency wants OPM to consider establishing or revis-ing the definition of a COLA area, the head of the department or agency or his or her designee must submit a re-quest in writing to OPM. § 591.207 Which areas are COLA areas? OPM has established the following COLA areas: (a) City of Anchorage, AK, and 80-kil- ometer (50-mile) radius by shortest route using paved roads when avail-able, as measured from the Federal courthouse to the official duty station; (b) City of Fairbanks, AK, and 80-kil- ometer (50-mile) radius by shortest route using paved roads when avail-able, as measured from the Federal courthouse to the official duty station; (c) City of Juneau, AK, and 80-kilo- meter (50-mile) radius by shortest route using paved roads when avail-able, as measured from the Federal courthouse to the official duty station; (d) Rest of the State of Alaska; (e) City and County of Honolulu, HI; (f) County of Hawaii, HI; (g) County of Kauai, HI; (h) County of Maui (including Kalawao County), HI; (i) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (j) Territory of Guam and Common- wealth of the Northern Mariana Is-lands; and (k) U.S. Virgin Islands. [67 FR 22340, May 3, 2002, as amended at 73 FR 65245, Nov. 3, 2008] § 591.208 How does OPM establish COLA rates? OPM establishes COLA rates based on price differences between the COLA area and the Washington, DC, area, plus an adjustment factor. OPM ex-presses price differences as indexes. (a) OPM computes price indexes for various categories of consumer expend-itures. (b) OPM combines the price indexes using Consumer expenditure weights to produce an overall price index for the COLA area. (c) To combine overall price indexes for COLA areas with multiple survey areas, OPM uses employment weights to combine overall price indexes by survey area for COLA areas. The COLA areas that have multiple survey areas are listed in §591.215(b). (d) OPM adds an adjustment factor to the overall price index for the COLA area. § 591.209 What is a price index? (a) The price index is the COLA area price divided by the DC area price and multiplied by 100. (b) Example: COLA Area Average Price for Item A = $1.233 DC Area Average Price for Item A = $1.164 Computation: $1.233/$1.164 = 1.0592783 1.0592783 × 100 = 105.92783.

I (1–1–25 Edition) § 591.210 (c) In the case of the final index, OPM rounds the index to two decimal places. § 591.210 What are weights? (a) A weight is the relative impor- tance or share of a subpart of a group compared with the total for the group. A weight is frequently expressed as a percentage. For example, in a pie chart, each wedge has a percentage that represents its relative importance or the size of the wedge compared with the whole pie. (b) OPM uses two kinds of weights: Consumer expenditure weights and em-ployment', 'reassigned or reduced in grade for failure to satisfac-torily complete a probationary period as a supervisor or manager; (d) A rate received by an individual while employed by the government of the District of Columbia who was first employed by that government on or after October 1, 1987; (e) A rate received by an individual while employed by a Department of De-fense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality; (f) A rate received solely during a pe- riod of interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A); (g) A special rate established under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455 (except as provided in §531.222(c)); (h) A rate received under a void ap- pointment or a rate otherwise contrary to applicable law or regulation; (i) A rate received as a member of the uniformed services; or VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00431 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR422 5 CFR Ch.

(a) An employee retains status as a GM employee (as defined in §531.203) when detailed to any position or when reassigned to another GS position in which the employee continues to be a supervisor or management official (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10) and (11)). (b) An employee permanently loses status as a GM employee if he or she is promoted (including a temporary pro-motion), transferred, demoted, reas-signed to a position in which the em-ployee will no longer be a supervisor or management official, has a break in service of more than 3 days, or becomes entitled to a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536. (A retained grade is not con-sidered in determining whether a GM employee has been reduced in grade. See 5 CFR 536.205.) § 531.242 Setting pay upon loss of GM status. (a) On loss of status as a GM em- ployee under §531.241 (except as pro-vided in paragraph (b) of this section), an employee must receive his or her ex-isting payable rate of basic pay, plus any of the following adjustments that may be applicable on the effective date of the loss of status, in the order speci-fied: (1) The amount of any annual adjust- ment in GS rates under 5 U.S.C. 5303, and the amount of any adjustment in locality payments or special rate sup-plements, to which the employee other-wise would be entitled on that date; (2) The amount of any within-grade increase to which the employee other-wise would be entitled on that date under 5 U.S.C. 5335 and subpart D of this part; (3) The amount resulting from a pro- motion effective on that date (con-sistent with §531.243(c)); (4) In the case of an employee who loses GM status without a change of grade and whose GS rate falls between two steps of a GS grade, the amount of any increase needed to pay the em-ployee the rate for the next higher step of that grade; and (5) In the case of an employee whose resulting GS rate is below the min-imum rate of a GS grade, the amount of any increase needed to pay the em-ployee the minimum rate for that grade. (b) For an employee who loses status as a GM employee as a result of a de-motion, pay must be set as provided in §531.215. A GM employee’s off-step GS rate at the grade before demotion is not converted to a GS step rate before the demotion, but the employee must be placed on a GS step rate when pay is set in the lower grade. § 531.243 Promotion of a GM employee. (a) Upon promotion, an employee’s status as a GM employee ends, as pro-vided in §531.241(b). (b) When an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a temporary promotion and is returned to the lower grade upon expiration or termination of the temporary promotion under §531.215(c)(1), he or she will be deemed to have been placed at the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the employ-ee’s former GS rate (as a GM employee) on the effective date of the temporary promotion, before applying any other step increases based on his or her serv-ice during the temporary promotion. (c) A GM employee’s GS rate is used as the existing rate of pay in applying the promotion rule in §531.214. A GM employee’s off-step GS rate in the grade before promotion is not con-verted to a GS step rate in applying the promotion rule, but the employee must be placed on a GS step rate in the post-promotion grade. § 531.244 Adjusting a GM employee’s rate at the time of an annual pay adjustment. (a) On the effective date of an annual pay adjustment under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or similar authority, an agency must set the new GS rate for a GM employee as follows: (1) For a GM employee whose GS rate equals a regular GS step rate, set the employee’s rate at the new step rate in the adjusted General Schedule that VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00432 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR423 Office of Personnel Management § 531.247 corresponds to the employee’s grade and step as in effect immediately be-fore the effective date of the pay ad-justment. (2) For a GM employee whose GS rate is below the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee’s grade, in-crease the existing GS rate by the same percentage as the annual pay ad-justment for the GS rate range applica-ble to the employee’s grade, with the result rounded to the nearest dollar (not to exceed the minimum rate of the range). (3) For a GM employee whose GS rate is between GS step rates, apply the fol-lowing method: Step A Using the rates and ranges in effect immediately before the annual pay adjustment, find the dif- ference between the GM employee’s GS rate and the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee’s grade. Step B Find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the GS rate range in effect im-mediately before the annual pay adjustment. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation in 5 U.S.C. 5303(f), use the uncapped maximum rate.) Step C Divide', '293.103 Recordkeeping standards. (a) The head of each agency shall en- sure that persons having access to or involved in the creation, development, processing, use, or maintenance of per-sonnel records are informed of perti-nent recordkeeping regulations and re-quirements of the Office of Personnel Management and the agency. Author-ity to maintain personnel records does not constitute authority to maintain information in the record merely be-cause it may be useful; both Govern-ment-wide and internal agency per-sonnel records shall contain only infor-mation concerning an individual that is relevant and necessary to accom-plish the Federal personnel manage-ment purposes required by statute, Ex-ecutive order, or Office regulation. (b) The Office is responsible for es- tablishing minimum standards of accu-racy, relevancy, necessity, timeliness, and completeness for personnel records it requires agencies to maintain. These standards are discussed in appropriate chapters of the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping. Before approval of any agency requests for changes in record-keeping practices governed by the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, the Office will examine the proposal or re-quest in the context of such standards set forth by the agency in support of the proposal and in light of the per-sonnel program area that requires these records.

Factors to be considered in de-termining whether to collect the data from the individual concerned or a third party are when: (1) The nature of the information is such that it can only be obtained from another party; (2) The cost of collecting the infor- mation directly from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from another party; (3) There is virtually no risk that in- formation collected from other parties, if inaccurate, could result in a deter-mination adverse to the individual con-cerned; (4) The information supplied by an individual must be verified by another party; or (5) There are provisions made, to the greatest extent practicable, to vertify information collected from another party with the individual concerned. § 293.105 Restrictions on collection and use of information. (a) First Amendment. Personnel records describing how individuals ex-ercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment are prohibited unless ex-pressly authorized by statute, or by the individual concerned, or unless perti-nent to and within the scope of an au-thorized law enforcement activity. These rights include, but are not lim-ited to, free exercise of religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom to assemble and to petition the government. (b) Social Security Number. (1) Agencies may not require individ- uals to disclose their Social Security Number unless disclosure would be re-quired; (i) Under Federal statute; or (ii) Under any statute, Executive order, or regulation that authorizes any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records that was in existence and operating prior to January 1, 1975, to request the Social Security Number as a necessary means of verifying the identity of an indi-vidual. (2) Individuals asked to voluntarily (circumstances not covered by para-graph (b)(1) of this section) provide their Social Security Number shall suf-fer no penalty or denial of benefits for refusing to provide it. § 293.106 Safeguarding information about individuals. (a) To ensure the security and con- fidentiality of personnel records, in whatever form, each agency shall es-tablish administrative, technical, and physical controls to protect informa-tion in personnel records from unau-thorized access, use, modification, de-struction, or disclosure. As a min-imum, these controls shall require that all persons whose official duties re-quire access to and use of personnel records be responsible and accountable for safeguarding those records and for ensuring that the records are secured whenever they are not in use or under the direct control of authorized per-sons. Generally, personnel records should be held, processed, or stored only where facilities and conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized ac-cess. (b) Personnel records must be stored in metal filing cabinets which are locked when the records are not in use, or in a secured room. Alternative stor-age facilities may be employed pro-vided they furnish an equivalent or greater degree of security than these methods. Except for access by the data subject, only employees whose official duties require access shall be allowed to handle and use personnel records, in whatever form or media the records might appear. To the extent feasible, entry into personnel record storage areas shall be similarly limited. Docu-mentation of the removal of records from storage areas must be kept so that adequate control procedures can be established to assure that removed records are returned on a timely basis. (c) Disposal and destruction of per- sonnel records shall be in accordance with the General Record Schedule issued by the General Services Admin- istration for the records or, alter-natively, with Office or agency records control schedules approved by the Na-tional Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.

Agen-cies may, at their option, apply these provisions to time-limited appoint-ments and positions. This subpart does not apply to appointments or positions in the Senior Executive Service. § 315.904 Basic requirement. (a) An employee is required to serve a probationary period prescribed by the agency upon initial appointment to a supervisory and/or managerial posi-tion. (b) An employee is required to com- plete a single probationary period in a supervisory position and a single pro-bationary period in a managerial posi-tion, regardless of the number of agen-cies, occupations, or positions in which the employee serves. However, an agen-cy may by regulation provide for ex-ceptions to the probationary period for managers who have satisfactorily com-pleted a probationary period for super-visors when justified on the basis of performance and experience. (c) Employees who, as of the date this requirement is effective, are serv-ing or have served in Federal civilian supervisory or managerial positions without time limitation, or in time- limited supervisory or managerial posi-tions under an official assignment ex-ceeding 120 days, are exempt from its provisions, except that supervisors who are assigned to managerial positions may, according to agency regulations, be required to serve a probationary pe-riod for managers. § 315.905 Length of the probationary period.

(a) An employee who is reassigned, transferred, or promoted to another su-pervisory or managerial position while serving a probationary period under this subpart is subject to the proba- tionary period prescribed for the new position. Service in the former position counts toward completion of the proba-tionary period in the new position. If the former position was supervisory and the new position managerial, serv-ice counts in the manner prescribed by agency regulation. (b) Service on detail, temporary pro- motion, or reassignment to another su-pervisory or managerial position while serving probation is creditable toward completion of probation. Service in a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial posi-tion is not creditable. (c) Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the proba-tionary period by an equal amount. (d) Service during a probationary pe- riod from which an employee was sepa-rated or demoted for performance or conduct reasons does not count toward completion of probation required under a subsequent appointment. In other sit-uations in which an employee does not complete probation, service is cred-itable as determined by agency policy. (e) Temporary service in a super- visory or managerial position under temporary appointment, promotion, or reassignment prior to probation is cred- itable as determined by agency policy. Prior service under a detail may be credited only when a detail to a super-visory or managerial position is made permanent without a break in service.

(1) An agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year. The appointment may be ex-tended up to a maximum of 1 addi-tional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (i.e., to a position that replaces and ab- sorbs the position to which an indi-vidual was originally appointed) is con-sidered to be an extension of the origi-nal appointment. Appointment to a po-sition involving the same basic duties and in the same major subdivision of the agency and same local commuting area as the original appointment is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment. (2) An agency may not fill a position by temporary appointment if that posi-tion has previously been filled by tem-porary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the pre-ceding 3-year period.

The question targets a specific provision that could be particularly important for:

1. HR Specialists: Understanding the noncompetitive conversion process for readers, interpreters, and personal assistants provides critical guidance on hiring procedures for employees with disabilities or specialized support roles.

2. Federal Employees: Those working in these specific roles would find this information crucial for understanding potential career advancement opportunities.

3. Managers: Knowing the conditions for noncompetitive conversion helps in workforce planning and understanding alternative hiring mechanisms.

The question demonstrates a practical information need by exploring a nuanced aspect of federal employment regulations. It goes beyond surface-level information and seeks to understand the specific conditions that enable career path transitions for these specialized positions.

While not applicable to all federal employees, the question is valuable for those in specific support roles and represents a targeted exploration of Title 5 employment provisions. The technical nature of the question suggests a genuine need for precise regulatory information, making it a useful query for those navigating federal employment policies."
" What documentation must agencies maintain when using commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services?
"," Per §300.407, agencies are required to:
1. Maintain records demonstrating that using commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services is:
   - Cost effective
   - Has not violated merit system principles
   - Has not committed any prohibited personnel practices
2. Provide reports on the use of commercial recruiting firms to OPM when requested, based on the records maintained in paragraph (a)","['and candidates referred from the com-mercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service; and (3) Follow all requirements for ap- pointment, including veterans pref-erence, where applicable. § 300.407 Documentation. (a) Agencies are required to maintain records necessary to determine that using commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services is cost effective and has not resulted in the violation of merit system principles or the commission of any prohibited per-sonnel practice. (b) When requested by OPM, agencies will provide reports on the use of com-mercial recruiting firms, based on the records required in paragraph (a) of this section.

Subpart E—Use of Private Sector Temporaries SOURCE : 54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, unless otherwise noted. § 300.501 Definitions. For purposes of this subpart: (a) A temporary help service firm is a private sector entity which quickly provides other organizations with spe-cific services performed by its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief or intermittent periods. The firm is the legally respon- sible employer and maintains that re-lationship during the time its employ-ees are assigned to a client. The firm, not the client organization, recruits, tests, hires, trains, assigns, pays, pro-vides benefits and leave to, and as nec- essary, addresses performance prob-lems, disciplines, and terminates its employees. Among other employer ob-ligations, the firm is responsible for payroll deductions and payment of in-come taxes, social security (FICA), un-employment insurance, and workers’ compensation, and shall provide re-quired liability insurance and bonding. (b) Private sector temporaries or outside temporaries are those employees of a temporary help service firm who are supervised and paid by that firm and whom that firm assigns to various cli-ent organizations who have contracted for the temporary use of their skills when required. (c) Parental and family responsibilities are defined in OPM issuances and in-clude situations such as absence for pregnancy, childbirth, child care, and care for elderly or infirm parents or other dependents. (d) A Federal supervisor of Federal em- ployees is defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10) as an individual employed by an agency having authority in the interest of the agency to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, trans-fer, furlough, layoff, recall, suspend, dis-cipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but re-quires the consistent exercise of independent judgment * * * (e) A critical need is a sudden or unex- pected occurrence; an emergency; a pressing necessity; or an exigency. Such occasions are characterized by additional work or deadlines required by statute, Executive order, court order, regulation, or formal directive from the head of an agency or subordi-nate official authorized to take final action on behalf of the agency head. A recurring, cyclical peak workload, by itself, is not a critical need. (f) A local commuting area is defined in part 351 of this chapter.

[61 FR 19510, May 2, 1996] § 300.503 Conditions for using private sector temporaries. An agency may enter into a contract or other procurement arrangement with a temporary help service firm for the brief or intermittent use of the skills of private sector temporaries, when required, and may call for those services, subject to these conditions: (a) One of the following short-term situations exists— (1) An employee is absent for a tem- porary period because of a personal need including emergency, accident, illness, parental or family responsibil-ities, or mandatory jury service, but not including vacations or other cir-cumstances which are not shown to be compelling in the judgment of the agency, or (2) An agency must carry out work for a temporary period which cannot be delayed in the judgment of the agency because of a critical need. (b) The need cannot be met with cur- rent employees or through the direct appointment of temporary employees within the time available by the date, and for the duration of time, help is needed. At minimum, this should in-clude an agency determination that there are no qualified candidates on the applicant supply file and on the re-employment priority list (both of which must provide preference for vet-erans), and no qualified disabled vet-erans with a compensable service-con-nected disability of 30 percent or more under 5 U.S.C. 3112, who are imme-diately available for temporary ap-pointment of the duration required, and that employees cannot be reas-signed or detailed without causing undue delay in their regular work. In instances where a need is foreseeable, as when approval of employee absence is requested well in advance, an agency may have sufficient time to follow the temporary appointment recruiting re- quirements, including veterans’ pref-erence found in 5 CFR part 316 to deter-mine whether qualified candidates are available by the date needed and for the length of service required. (c) These services shall not be used: (1) In lieu of the regular recruitment and hiring procedures under the civil service laws for permanent appoint-ment in the competitive civil service, or (2) To displace a Federal employee. (3) To circumvent controls on em- ployment levels. (4) In lieu of appointing a surplus or displaced Federal employee as required by 5 CFR part 330, subpart F (Agency Career Transition Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees) and subpart G (Interagency Career Transition Assist-ance Plan for Displaced Employees.)

No employer-employee relationship is created by an agency’s use of private sector temporaries under these regula-tions. Services furnished by temporary help firms shall be performed by their employees who shall not be considered or treated as Federal employees for any purpose, shall not be regarded as performing a personal service, and shall not be eligible for civil service employee benefits, including retire-ment. Further, to avoid creating any appearance of such a relationship,', 'respectively), an em-ployee may elect to substitute the fol-lowing paid leave for any or all of the leave without pay: (1) Accrued or accumulated annual or sick leave under subchapter I of chap-ter 63 of title 5, United States Code (or equivalent annual or sick leave under another authority), consistent with the law and regulations governing the granting and use of annual or sick leave (including the limitations on the purposes for which sick leave may be used under §630.401(a) and the hours limitations in §630.401(b) through (e)); (2) Advanced annual or sick leave ap- proved under the same terms and con- ditions that apply to any other agency employee who requests advanced an-nual or sick leave; and (3) Annual leave donated to an em- ployee under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program or the Voluntary Leave Bank Program, consistent with subparts I and J of this part, or equiva-lent donated annual leave under an-other authority. (d) Leave to care for a covered service- member. For family and medical leave taken under §630.1203(j) (corresponding to 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(3) and (4)), an em-ployee may elect to substitute the an-nual and sick leave identified in para-graph (c) of this section, except that any sick leave credited to the em-ployee may be substituted without re-gard to any of the normally applicable limitations on the use of sick leave. (e) Employee entitlement to substitute. (1) An employee is entitled to elect whether or not to substitute paid leave for leave without pay under this sub-part, as permitted in this section.

(3) An agency may not require an em- ployee to substitute paid leave for leave without pay. (4) An employee may request to use annual leave or sick leave without in-voking family and medical leave, and, in that case, the agency exercises its normal authority with respect to ap-proving or disapproving the timing of when the leave may be used. (f) Notification by employee and retro- active substitution. (1) An employee must notify the agency of the employ-ee’s election to substitute paid leave for leave without pay under this sec-tion prior to the date such paid leave commences ( i.e., no retroactive substi- tution), except as provided in para-graphs (f)(2) through (f)(4) of this sec-tion. (2) An employee may retroactively substitute annual leave or sick leave for leave without pay granted under this subpart covering a past period of time, if the substitution is made in conjunction with the retroactive grant-ing of leave without pay under §630.1203(b). (3) An employee may retroactively substitute transferred (donated) annual leave for leave without pay granted under this subpart in the cir-cumstances covered by §§630.909(d) or 630.1009(d). (4) An employee may retroactively substitute paid parental leave for ap- plicable leave without pay granted under this subpart, as provided in §630.1706(a) and subject to the require-ments governing paid parental leave in subpart Q of this part. If the employ-ee’s leave without pay was not granted on a prospective basis under this sub-part, the retroactive substitution of paid parental leave may not be made unless the leave without pay period has been retroactively designated as leave under this subpart, as allowed under §630.1203(b). [85 FR 48091, Aug. 10, 2020] § 630.1207 Notice of leave. (a) If leave taken under §630.1203(a) of this part is foreseeable based on an ex-pected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treat-ment, the employee shall provide no- tice to the agency of his or her inten-tion to take leave not less than 30 cal-endar days before the date the leave is to begin. If the date of birth or place-ment or planned medical treatment re-quires leave to begin within 30 calendar days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable. (b) If leave taken under §630.1203(a) (3) or (4) of this part is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee shall consult with the agency and make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the agency, subject to the approval of the health care provider. The agency may, for justifiable cause, request that an employee reschedule medical treat-ment, subject to the approval of the health care provider. (c) If the need for leave taken under §630.1203(a)(5) is foreseeable, the em-ployee must provide notice as soon as practicable, regardless of how far in ad-vance the leave is being requested. (d) If the need for leave is not fore- seeable—e.g., a medical emergency or the unexpected availability of a child for adoption or foster care, and the em-ployee cannot provide 30 calendar days’ notice of his or her need for leave, the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. If nec-essary, notice may be given by an em-ployee’s personal representative (e.g., a family member or other responsible party). If the need for leave is not fore-seeable and the employee is unable, due to circumstances beyond his or her control, to provide notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be de-layed or denied. (e) If the need for leave is foresee- able, and the employee fails to give 30 calendar days’ notice with no reason-able excuse for the delay of notifica-tion, the agency may delay the taking of leave under §630.1203(a) of this part until at least 30 calendar days after the date the employee provides notice of his or her need for family and medical leave.

(2) Requesting confidentiality. If the claimant wishes the claim to be treat-ed confidentially, the claim must spe-cifically request that the identity of the claimant not be revealed to the agency. Witnesses or other sources may also request confidentiality. OPM will make every effort to conduct its investigation in a way to maintain confidentiality. If OPM is unable to ob-tain sufficient information to render a decision and preserve the requested confidentiality, OPM will notify the claimant that the claim will be can-celled with no further action by OPM unless the claimant voluntarily pro-vides written authorization for his or her name to be revealed. (b) Agency. (1) In FLSA exemption sta- tus determination claims, the burden of proof rests with the agency that as-serts the FLSA exemption. (2) The agency must provide the claimant with a written acknowledg-ment of the date the claim was re-ceived. (3) Upon a claimant’s request, and subject to any Privacy Act require-ments, an agency must provide a claimant with information relevant to the claim.

(a) Withdrawal. OPM may grant a re- quest from the claimant or claimant’s representative to withdraw an FLSA claim at any time before OPM issues its decision. The claimant or the claimant’s representative must submit the request in writing to OPM. (b) Cancellation. OPM may, at its dis- cretion, cancel an FLSA claim if the claimant or the claimant’s representa-tive fails to provide requested informa-tion within 15 workdays after the date of the request, unless the claimant or the claimant’s representative requests additional time and OPM grants a longer period of time in which to pro-vide the requested information. OPM may, at its discretion, reconsider a cancelled claim on a showing that cir-cumstances beyond the claimant’s con-trol prevented pursuit of the claim. § 551.708 Finality and effect of OPM FLSA claim decision. (a) OPM will send an FLSA claim de- cision to the claimant or the claim-ant’s representative and the agency. An FLSA claim decision made by OPM is final. There is no further right of ad-ministrative appeal. However, at its discretion, OPM may reconsider its FLSA claim decision when material in-formation was not considered or there was a material error of law, regulation, or fact in the original decision. The re-quest must be submitted in writing and received by OPM within 45 calendar days after the date of the decision. At its unreviewable discretion, OPM may waive the time limit. (b) A decision by OPM under the Act is binding on all administrative, certi-fying, payroll, disbursing, and account-ing officials of agencies for which OPM administers the Act. (c)(1) Upon receipt of a decision, the agency employing the claimant during the claim period must take all nec-essary steps to comply with the deci-sion, including adherence to compli-ance instructions provided with the de-cision. All compliance actions must be completed within the time specified in the decision, unless an extension of time is requested by the agency and granted by OPM.

It addresses an important administrative and compliance aspect of federal hiring processes, which would be particularly useful for:

1. HR Specialists: They need to understand the precise documentation requirements when outsourcing recruitment, ensuring legal compliance and proper record-keeping.

2. Agency Managers: Understanding documentation standards helps them manage recruitment processes effectively and transparently.

3. Compliance Officers: The question directly relates to regulatory requirements for maintaining proper records during external recruitment efforts.

The question is practical because many federal agencies use external recruitment services and must maintain strict documentation for accountability, budget tracking, and potential audits. It touches on critical aspects of federal hiring procedures that have direct implications for workforce management.

While the question is somewhat technical, it represents a genuine information need for those involved in federal recruitment processes. The specificity of asking about documentation requirements suggests a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in external recruitment for federal agencies.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 rating is that it might be considered a somewhat specialized query that wouldn't be universally applicable to all federal employees, but it remains highly valuable for HR and recruitment professionals."
" When is travel time considered ""hours of work"" for overtime pay purposes, and what specific conditions might exclude travel time from being compensable?
"," According to the policy, travel time is not automatically considered hours of work. Specifically:
- Travel from home to work and vice versa is not considered hours of work
- When an employee travels directly from home to a temporary duty location outside their official duty station, the time they would normally spend on home-to-work travel must be deducted from hours of work
- The policy uses a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine whether travel is within or outside an employee's official duty station
- The agency's definition of an official duty station cannot be smaller than the definition in the Federal Travel Regulation","['a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine whether an employee’s travel is within or outside the limits of the employee’s official duty station for determining entitlement to overtime pay for travel under paragraph (g) of this section ex-cept that— (1) An agency’s definition of an em- ployee’s official duty station for deter-mining overtime pay for travel may not be smaller than the definition of ‘‘official station and post of duty’’ under the Federal Travel Regulation issued by the General Services Admin-istration (41 CFR 300–3.1); and (2) Travel from home to work and vice versa is not hours of work. When an employee travels directly from home to a temporary duty location outside the limits of his or her official duty station, the time the employee would have spent in normal home to work travel shall be deducted from hours of work. (k) Standby duty. (1) An employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-re-lated reasons, the employee is re-stricted by official order to a des-ignated post of duty and is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employ-ee’s activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effec-tively for his or her own purposes. A finding that an employee’s activities are substantially limited may not be based on the fact that an employee is subject to restrictions necessary to en-sure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and respon-sibilities, such as restrictions on alco-hol consumption or use of certain medications. (2) An employee is not considered re- stricted for ‘‘work-related reasons’’ if, for example, the employee remains at the post of duty voluntarily, or if the restriction is a natural result of geo-graphic isolation or the fact that the employee resides on the agency’s prem-ises. For example, in the case of an em-ployee assigned to work in a remote wildland area or on a ship, the fact that the employee has limited mobility when relieved from duty would not be a basis for finding that the employee is restricted for work-related reasons. (l) On-call status. An employee is off duty, and time spent in an on-call sta-tus is not hours of work if— (1) The employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or carry an elec-tronic device for the purpose of being contacted, even though the employee is required to remain within a reasonable call-back radius; or (2) The employee is allowed to make arrangements for another person to perform any work that may arise dur-ing the on-call period. (m) Sleep and meal time. (1) Bona fide sleep and meal periods may not be con-sidered hours of work, except as pro-vided in paragraphs (m)(2), (m)(3), and (m)(4) of this section. If a sleep or meal period is interrupted by a call to duty, the time spent on duty is hours of work. (2) Sleep and meal periods during reg- ularly scheduled tours of duty are hours of work for employees who re-ceive annual premium pay for regu-larly scheduled standby duty under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1). (3) When employees are assigned to work shifts of 24 hours or more during which they must remain within the confines of their duty station in a standby status, and for which they do not receive annual premium pay for regularly scheduled standby duty under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1), the amount of bona fide sleep and meal time excluded from hours of work may not exceed 8 hours in any 24-hour period. No sleep time may be excluded unless the em-ployee had the opportunity to have an uninterrupted period of at least 5 hours of sleep during the applicable sleep pe-riod.

If the promotion action results in a ter-minating condition as described in §536.308 (e.g., the resulting rate is equal to or greater than the existing retained rate), pay retention ceases to apply. Otherwise, the employee’s existing re-tained rate continues. (5) In applying this section to a re- tained rate employee who receives a temporary promotion or temporary re-assignment, the temporary promotion or temporary reassignment is not a basis for permanently terminating an employee’s pay retention entitlement. When the temporary promotion or tem-porary reassignment ends, the employ-ee’s pay retention entitlement will be determined as if the employee had not received the temporary promotion or temporary reassignment. (6) Notwithstanding §536.308(a)(1), an agency must continue a retained rate entitlement for an employee serving under an interim appointment made under 5 CFR 772.102 if the employee’s pay was retained under this subpart under the appointment immediately preceding the interim appointment.

(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for an employee’s position of record is in-creased while the employee is receiving a retained rate, the employee is enti-tled to 50 percent of the amount of the increase in that maximum rate, subject to the maximum rate limitation in §536.306. This 50-percent adjustment rule applies only when the maximum rate increases are attributable to the adjustment of the employee’s existing pay schedule or the establishment of a new pay schedule that covers the em-ployee’s existing position of record. (2) As provided in 5 CFR 531.206, a re- tained rate adjustment under para-graph (a)(1) of this section is a general pay adjustment that must be applied before any geographic conversion under §536.303(b) or any other simultaneous pay action. The retained rate adjust-ment under paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion must be determined based on the employee’s position of record and offi-cial worksite as in effect immediately before the effective date of the adjust-ment. (3) Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5363(c), a change in the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range based on a change in the employee’s official worksite is not considered in applying paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The employee’s new retained rate must be determined under the geographic con-version rule in §536.303(b). (4) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to an increase in an em-ployee’s highest applicable rate range that results from a change in the em-ployee’s position of record. Such an in-crease is not attributable to an adjust-ment in the pay schedule applicable to the employee’s position and thus is not an increase as described in 5 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2)(B). (b) When a pay schedule adjustment causes an employee’s retained rate (after any adjustment under this sec-tion) to become equal to or lower than the maximum rate of the highest appli-cable rate range for the grade of the employee’s position, the employee is entitled to the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range, and pay retention ceases to apply. § 536.306 Limitation on retained rates. (a) A retained rate may not at any time exceed the rate payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule. (b) When an employee’s retained rate is limited under this section, an agency may not apply this subpart or the pro-visions of any other law or regulation to the rate of basic pay the employee would have received but for this limi-tation.

(b) For the purpose of applying other laws and regulations not listed in para-graph (a) of this section to an employee receiving a retained rate, the employ-ee’s rate of basic pay is deemed to be the applicable maximum rate of basic pay for the employee’s position of record (e.g., the maximum rate of basic pay for a locality rate range or special rate range, as applicable, for the pur-pose of computing a percentage-based award', 'section 5103 or 5110 of title 5, United States Code, at any time.

Travel time compensation is a critical issue for federal employees and managers who need to understand precisely when employees are entitled to overtime pay during work-related travel. 

The question demonstrates high usefulness because it:
1. Addresses a specific compensation policy that impacts employee pay and employer obligations
2. Requires detailed understanding of federal labor regulations
3. Has direct practical implications for both employees and HR professionals
4. Covers a topic that can be legally and financially significant
5. Seeks clarification on the conditions and exceptions related to travel time compensation

HR specialists would find this question particularly valuable for ensuring proper overtime calculations, managers would benefit from understanding when travel time is compensable, and employees would gain insight into their potential compensation rights during work-related travel. The question's technical nature suggests a genuine need to understand the precise legal and regulatory framework governing travel time compensation in federal employment."
 What performance rating must a senior executive receive to be considered for an annual pay increase?," According to §534.404(b)(2), a senior executive who receives an annual summary rating of ""outstanding"" performance must be considered for an annual pay increase, subject to the maximum rate of basic pay limitation.","['III of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318. (3) Rates of basic pay higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Sched-ule generally are reserved for those senior executives who have dem-onstrated the highest levels of indi-vidual performance and/or made the greatest contributions to the agency’s performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system for senior executives, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, consistent with the agency’s strategic human capital plan. (b) Suspension of certification of per- formance appraisal system. A senior ex- ecutive whose rate of basic pay is high-er than the rate for level III of the Ex-ecutive Schedule may not suffer a re-duction in pay because his or her agen-cy’s applicable performance appraisal system certification is suspended under 5 CFR 430.405(h). The senior executive will continue to receive his or her cur-rent SES rate and is not eligible for a pay adjustment until the senior execu-tive is assigned to a position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or until certification of the employing agency’s applicable per-formance appraisal system is rein-stated under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363 and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C. [69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005] § 534.404 Setting and adjusting pay for senior executives. (a) Setting pay upon initial appoint- ment to the SES. An authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of an individual at any rate within the SES rate range upon initial appoint-ment to the SES, subject to the limita- tion on the maximum rate of basic pay in §534.403(a). Rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Sched-ule generally are reserved for those newly appointed senior executives who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan. In setting a new senior ex-ecutive’s rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individual’s experience, quali-fications, and accomplishments as they relate to the requirements of the SES position, as well as the individual’s current responsibilities. When making a first appointment (regardless of ten-ure) as a civilian employee of the Fed-eral Government, an agency may not consider the individual’s salary history (i.e., existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer. (b) Adjusting the pay of SES members. (1) An authorized agency official may adjust (increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive con-sistent with the agency’s plan for set-ting and adjusting SES rates of basic pay under paragraph (g) of this section. (2) A senior executive who receives an annual summary rating of out-standing performance must be consid-ered for an annual pay increase, sub-ject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in §534.403(a).

In assessing a senior execu-tive’s performance and/or contribution to the agency’s performance, the au-thorized agency official may consider such things as unique skills, qualifica-tions, or competencies that the indi-vidual possesses, and their significance to the agency’s performance, as well as the senior executive’s current respon-sibilities. Senior executives who dem-onstrate the highest levels of indi-vidual performance and/or make the greatest contributions to the agency’s performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan, must re-ceive the highest rates of basic pay or pay adjustments. (4)(i) On the effective date of an in- crease in the minimum or maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range under §534.403(a)(1) or (2), an authorized agency official may increase the rate of basic pay of a senior executive who meets or exceeds his or her perform-ance expectations by an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the senior executive’s rel-ative position in the SES rate range, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A pay increase made under this para-graph is not considered a pay adjust-ment for the purpose of applying §534.404(c). (ii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be pro-vided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is at or below the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if such an increase would cause the sen-ior executive’s rate of basic pay to ex-ceed the rate for level III of the Execu-tive Schedule unless the senior execu-tive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most re-cently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who per-forms the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspec-tor General, where applicable) has ap- proved the increase in pay. (iii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be pro-vided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed ap-praisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay.

(ii) For non-critical elements, when established,— (A) At least two levels for appraisal shall be used, and (B) A performance standard(s) shall be established at whatever level(s) is appropriate. (iii) The absence of an established performance standard at a level speci-fied in the program shall not preclude a determination that performance is at that level.

Performance on each critical and non- critical element shall be appraised against its performance standard(s). Ongoing appraisal methods shall in-clude, but not be limited to, con-ducting one or more progress reviews during each appraisal period. (c) Marginal performance. Appraisal programs should provide assistance whenever performance is determined to be below ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equiva- lent but above ‘‘Unacceptable.’’ (d) Unacceptable performance.

(a) As soon as practicable after the end of the appraisal period, a written, or otherwise recorded, rating of record shall be given to each employee. (1) A rating of record shall be based only on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated ap-praisal period. (2) An agency shall not issue a rating of record that assumes a level of per-formance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee’s performance. (3) Except as provided in §430.208(i), a rating of record is final when it is issued to an employee with all appro-priate reviews and signatures. (b) Rating of record procedures for each appraisal program shall include a method for deriving and assigning a summary level as specified in para-graph (d) of this section based on ap-praisal of performance on critical ele-ments and, as applicable, non-critical elements. (1) A Level 1 summary (‘‘Unaccept- able’’) shall be assigned if and only if performance on one or more critical elements is appraised as ‘‘Unaccept-able.’’ (2) Consideration of non-critical ele- ments shall not result in assigning a Level 1 summary (‘‘ Unacceptable’’). (c) The method for deriving and as- signing a summary level may not limit or require the use of particular sum-mary levels ( i.e., establish a forced dis- tribution of summary levels).

(3) The term ‘‘Outstanding’’ shall be used only to describe a Level 5 sum-mary. (4) The designation of a summary level and its pattern shall be used to provide consistency in describing rat-ings of record and as a reference point for applying other related regulations, including, but not limited to, assigning additional retention service credit under §351.504 of this chapter. (5) Under the provisions of §351.504(e) of this chapter, the number of years of additional retention service credit es-tablished for a summary level of a rat-ing of record shall be applied in a uni-form and consistent manner within a competitive area in any given reduc-tion in force, but the number of years may vary: (i) In different reductions in force; (ii) In different competitive areas; and (iii) In different summary level pat- terns within the same competitive area.

Renewals or ex-tensions will not be issued unless justi- fied by exceptional circumstances. § 352.202 Request for Letter of Author- ity. When an agency believes that an emergency situation is so critical as to justify offers of reemployment rights, it may request OPM to issue a Letter of Authority. In submitting the request the agency shall present its justifica-tion in terms of the standards provided in §352.203. § 352.203 Standards for issuing Letters of Authority. OPM will determine the standards to be used in issuing Letters of Authority, which shall include the following: (a) The positions to be filled must be related to emergency situations for which the usual recruiting methods are inadequate. (b) The positions must be a part of a specific program immediately essential to the national interest. (c) The positions must be essential to the functioning of the program. (d) There must be substantial basis for the belief that reemployment rights will be a significant and reasonable aid in meeting the emergency situation. § 352.204 Basic eligibility for reemploy- ment rights. (a) Employees eligible. The following employees in the executive branch of the Government are eligible to be granted reemployment rights when they are hired by another executive agency without break in service of a full workday by transfer or reinstate-ment, or by excepted appointment, in a position which the agency is currently authorized to fill with reemployment rights: (1) An employee serving in a competi- tive position under a career or career- conditional appointment; (2) An employee serving under a ca- reer appointment in the Senior Execu-tive Service (SES); or (3) A nontemporary excepted em- ployee.

S OURCE : 82 FR 5350, Jan. 18, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Subpart A—General § 339.101 Coverage. This part applies to— (a) Applicants for and employees in competitive service positions; and (b) Applicants for and employees in positions excepted from the competi-tive service when medical issues arise in connection with an OPM regulation that governs a particular personnel ac-tion, such as removal of a preference eligible employee in the excepted serv-ice under part 752. § 339.102 Purpose and effect. (a) This part defines the cir- cumstances under which OPM permits medical documentation to be required and examinations and/or evaluations conducted to determine the nature of a medical condition that affects safe and efficient performance. (b) Personnel decisions based wholly or in part on the review of medical doc-umentation, as defined below, and the results of medical examinations and evaluations must be made in accord-ance with appropriate sections of this part. (c) Failure to meet medical (which may include psychological) standards and/or physical requirements estab-lished under this part means that the applicant or employee is not qualified for the position, unless reasonable ac-commodation or a waiver is appro-priate, in accordance with §§339.103 and 339.204. An employee’s refusal to be ex-amined or provide medical documenta- tion, as defined below, in accordance with a proper agency order authorized under this part, constitutes a basis for appropriate disciplinary or adverse ac-tion. After a tentative job offer of em-ployment conditioned on completion of a medical examination, an applicant’s refusal to be examined or provide med-ical documentation, as defined below, may result in the applicant’s removal from further consideration for the posi-tion. § 339.103 Compliance with disability laws. (a) The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Amendments Act of 2008 (collectively the ADA), establishes prohibitions against discrimination and the require-ments for reasonable accommodation that apply to the Federal Government through the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791(f). Con-sequently, actions under this part must comply with the non-discrimination provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the non-discrimination provisions of the ADA, and their implementing regu-lations. (b) Use of the term ‘‘qualified’’ in this part must comply with the Reha-bilitation Act, as']",4,"The context provides very specific details about performance ratings for senior executives, stating that a senior executive who receives an ""annual summary rating of outstanding performance must be considered for an annual pay increase"", which directly answers the question with high precision.",5,"This question is highly useful for multiple stakeholders in federal employment. It directly addresses performance management and compensation policies for Senior Executive Service (SES) members, which is a critical aspect of Title 5 regulations. The question is relevant to:

1. Senior Executives: Understanding the performance rating requirements for potential pay increases
2. HR Specialists: Knowing the specific performance standards for SES pay adjustments
3. Managers: Comprehending the performance evaluation criteria that impact executive compensation
4. Organizational Leadership: Ensuring proper implementation of performance-based compensation systems

The question targets a specific, practical concern in federal employment that requires precise knowledge of Title 5 regulations. It demonstrates a genuine need for information about performance evaluation and compensation policies at the senior executive level. The technical nature of the question suggests a serious intent to understand the formal mechanisms governing executive performance and pay increases.

This type of question is crucial for maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability in the federal government's performance management and compensation systems for its most senior leaders."
 Are there any restrictions on when an agency can commence a recruitment incentive service agreement?," Yes, § 575.105(c) specifies two key restrictions: An agency cannot commence a recruitment incentive service agreement during (1) a period of employment established under a relocation incentive service agreement, or (2) a period of employment established under a retention incentive service agreement or for which an employee is receiving retention incentive payments.","['78 FR 49363, Aug. 14, 2013] § 575.105 Applicability to employees. (a) A recruitment incentive may be paid under the conditions prescribed in this subpart to an employee who is newly appointed to a position listed in §575.103 that is likely to be difficult to fill, as determined under §575.106. (b)(1) An agency may target groups of similar positions (excluding positions covered by §575.103(a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(5) or those in similar categories approved by OPM under §575.103(a)(7)) that have been difficult to fill in the past or that may be difficult to fill in the future and make the required determination to offer a recruitment incentive to newly-appointed employees on a group basis. (2) An agency must define a targeted category of positions using factors that relate to the conditions described in §575.106(b). Factors that may be appro-priate include the following: occupa-tional series, grade level, distinctive job duties, unique competencies re-quired for the positions, and geo-graphic location. (3) An agency must review each deci- sion to target a group of similar posi-tions for the purpose of granting a re-cruitment incentive at least annually to determine whether the positions are still likely to be difficult to fill. An au-thorized agency official must certify this determination in writing. If an agency determines the positions are no longer likely to be difficult to fill, the agency may not offer a recruitment in-centive to newly-appointed employees in that group on a group basis. (c) An agency may not commence a recruitment incentive service agree-ment during— (1) A period of employment estab- lished under any service agreement re-quired for a relocation incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart B, or (2) A period of employment estab- lished under any service agreement re-quired for a retention incentive or for which an employee receives retention incentive payments without a service agreement under 5 CFR part 575, sub-part C.

(b) Factors for determining when a posi- tion is likely to be difficult to fill. An agency in its sole and exclusive discre-tion, subject only to OPM review and oversight, may determine that a posi-tion is likely to be difficult to fill if the agency is likely to have difficulty recruiting candidates with the com-petencies required for the position (or group of positions) in the absence of a recruitment incentive. An agency must consider the following factors, as appli-cable to the case at hand, in deter-mining whether a position (or group of positions) is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of a recruitment incen-tive and in documenting this deter-mination as required by §575.108: (1) The availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies required for the position, including the success of recent efforts to recruit can-didates for the position or similar posi-tions using indicators such as offer ac-ceptance rates, proportion of positions filled, and the length of time required to fill similar positions; (2) The salaries typically paid outside the Federal Government for similar po-sitions; (3) Recent turnover in similar posi- tions; (4) Employment trends and labor- market factors that may affect the agency’s ability to recruit candidates for similar positions; (5) Special or unique competencies required for the position; (6) Agency efforts to use non-pay au- thorities, such as special training and work scheduling flexibilities, to resolve difficulties alone or in combination with a recruitment incentive; (7) The desirability of the duties, work or organizational environment, or geographic location of the position; and (8) Other supporting factors. (c) An agency may determine that a position (or group of positions) is like-ly to be difficult to fill if OPM has ap- proved the use of a direct-hire author-ity applicable to the position (or group of positions) under 5 CFR part 337, sub-part B.

OPM will permit an agency with del- egated examining authority under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2) to use direct-hire au-thority under 5 U.S.C. 3304(a)(3) for a permanent or nonpermanent position or group of positions in the competi-tive service at GS–15 (or equivalent) and below, if OPM determines that there is either a severe shortage of can-didates or a critical hiring need for such positions. It is not required that this direct-hire authority be exercised by a delegated examining unit. Re-quests for direct-hire authority must be submitted by the agency’s Chief Human Capital Officer (or equivalent) at the agency headquarters level. OPM will determine the length of the direct- hire authority based on the justifica-tion. § 337.202 Definitions.

(a) OPM will determine when a severe shortage of candidates exists for par-ticular occupations, grades (or equiva-lent), and/or geographic locations. OPM may decide independently that such a shortage exists, or may make this deci-sion in response to a written request from an agency. (b) An agency when requesting di- rect-hire authority under this section, or OPM when deciding independently, must identify the position or positions that are difficult to fill and must pro-vide supporting evidence that dem-onstrates the existence of a severe shortage of candidates with respect to the position(s). The evidence should in-clude, as applicable, information about: (1) The results of workforce planning and analysis; (2) Employment trends including the local or national labor market; (3) The existence of nationwide or ge- ographic skills shortages; (4) Agency efforts, including recruit- ment initiatives, use of other appoint-ing authorities (e.g., schedule A, sched-ule B) and flexibilities, training and de- velopment programs tailored to the po-sition(s), and an explanation of why these recruitment and training efforts have not been sufficient; (5) The availability and quality of candidates; (6) The desirability of the geographic location of the position(s); (7) The desirability of the duties and/ or work environment associated with the position(s); and (8) Other pertinent information such as selective placement factors or other special requirements of the position, as well as agency use of hiring flexibili-ties such as recruitment or retention allowances or special salary rates. (c) A department or agency head (other than the Secretary of Defense) may determine, pursuant to section 1413(a) of Public Law 108–136, as amend-ed by section 853 of Public Law 110–181, that a shortage of highly qualified can-didates exists for certain Federal ac-quisition positions (covered under sec-tion 433(g)(1)(A) of title 41, United States Code). To make such a deter-mination, the deciding agency official must use the supporting evidence pre-scribed in 5 CFR 337.204(b)(1)–(8) and must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for documentation and report-ing purposes. (d) Information Technology (IT) posi- tions. (1) The head of a covered agency, as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, may determine whether a se-vere shortage of candidates exists at that agency for any position in the in-formation technology management se-ries, general schedule (GS)–2210 or equivalent. In making such a deter-mination, a covered agency must ad-here to and use the supporting evidence prescribed in 5 CFR 337.204(b)(1)–(8). For purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the U.S. Department of Vet-erans Affairs (VA) need only determine whether a severe shortage of highly- qualified candidates exists. In addition, a covered agency must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for docu-mentation and reporting purposes. Upon determination of such a finding, an agency head may approve a direct hire authority for covered positions within the agency.

A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the es-tablished coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee be-cause of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Promotion means a GS employee’s movement from one GS grade to a higher GS grade while continuously employed (including such a movement in conjunction with a transfer). Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative ac-tion for the position held by a GS em-ployee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a special rate, a locality rate, and a re-tained rate, but exclusive of additional pay of any other kind. For the purpose of applying the maximum payable rate rules in §§531.216 and 531.221 using a rate under a non-GS pay system as an employee’s highest previous rate, rate of basic pay means a rate of pay under other legal authority which is equiva-lent to a rate of basic pay for GS em-ployees, as described in this definition, excluding a rate under §531.223. (See also 5 CFR 530.308, 531.610, and 536.307.) Rate range or range means a range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or, for non-GS employees, similar rates under other legal authority. Reassignment means a change of an employee, while serving continuously in the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demo-tion. Reemployment means employment, in- cluding reinstatement or another type of appointment, after a break in serv-ice of at least 1 full workday. Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range appli-cable to a GS employee which is pay-able under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Service, under 5 CFR 359.705. Special rate means a rate of pay with- in a special rate schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or a similar rate for GS employees estab-lished under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). The term special rate VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00418 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR409 Office of Personnel Management § 531.205 does not include an LEO special base rate or an adjusted rate including mar-ket pay under 38 U.S.C. 7431(c). Special rate schedule means a pay schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, to provide higher rates of pay for specified categories of GS po-sitions or employees at one or more grades or levels or a similar schedule established for GS employees under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). Special rate supplement means the por- tion of a special rate paid above an em-ployee’s GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supple-ment equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer’s LEO spe-cial base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law en-forcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Exec-utive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in 5 CFR 530.304(a). Temporary promotion means a time- limited promotion with a not-to-exceed date or a specified term. Transfer means a change of an em- ployee, without a break in service of 1 full workday, from one branch of the Federal Government (executive, legis-lative, or judicial) to another or from one agency to another. Where different pay schedules apply means, in the context of applying the geographic conversion rule, that an employee’s official worksite is changed to a new location that would cause the employee to lose or gain coverage under a location-based pay schedule (i.e., locality rate schedule or special rate schedule) if the employee were to remain in the same position of record. Within-grade increase has the meaning given that term in §531.403.

(a) A law enforcement officer is enti- tled to LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. A law enforcement officer is entitled to the LEO special base rate that cor-responds to his or her grade and step. If an employee loses LEO status, the em-ployee is entitled to the GS rate for his or her grade and step unless a higher rate is set under the maximum payable rate rule in §531.221 or under the pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536, as ap-plicable. LEO special base rates are used in computing locality rates, as provided in subpart F of this part. A law enforcement officer may be enti-tled to a special rate that is computed using the underlying GS rate for the LEO’s grade and step. (b) When an employee’s GS rate or LEO special base rate is determined under the rules of this subpart, the agency must determine any other rate', 'where there is no ready access to an exit, under conditions requiring a breathing apparatus because all or part of the oxygen in the atmosphere has been displaced by toxic vapors or gas, and failure of the breathing apparatus would result in serious injury or death within the time re-quired to leave the tank July 1, 1972. 10.

The question demonstrates a practical information need for HR specialists, managers involved in hiring, and federal employees interested in understanding compensation strategies.

The query seeks clarity on potential limitations or conditions surrounding recruitment incentive service agreements, which directly relates to Title 5 regulations concerning employee compensation and recruitment practices. Such information is crucial for ensuring compliance, understanding agency hiring strategies, and making informed decisions about employment terms.

The question is technically phrased and shows a sophisticated understanding of federal employment mechanisms. It would be particularly useful for:
- HR professionals managing recruitment strategies
- Agency managers planning workforce acquisition
- Federal employees interested in understanding potential incentive structures
- Administrators responsible for implementing recruitment policies

The only reason it does not receive a perfect 5 rating is that it is somewhat specialized and might not have broad applicability across all federal employment contexts. However, for those directly involved in federal recruitment, this is a highly valuable and precise inquiry about regulatory constraints on recruitment incentive agreements."
" When do evacuation payments for a federal employee terminate during an emergency situation?
"," According to §550.407, evacuation payments terminate when the agency determines that:
1. The employee is assigned to another duty station outside the evacuation area
2. The employee abandons or is separated from their position
3. The employee's employment is terminated by transfer to retirement rolls or another annuity
4. The employee resumes duties at their original duty station
5. The agency determines payments are no longer warranted
6. The employee is determined to be covered by the Missing Persons Act (unless earlier termination applies)","['to work during the time period cov-ered. The number of days shall be de-termined, whenever possible, by ap-proximating the number of days per week normally worked by the em-ployee during an average 6-week pe-riod, as determined by the agency.

In determining the direct added ex- penses that may be payable as special allowances, the following shall be con-sidered: (a) An agency must determine the travel expenses and per diem for an evacuated employee and the travel ex-penses for his or her dependents in ac-cordance with the Federal Travel Reg-ulation (FTR) and any applicable im-plementing agency regulations, wheth-er or not the employee or dependents are actually covered by or subject to the FTR. In addition, an agency may authorize per diem for dependents of an evacuated employee at a rate equal to the rate payable to the employee, as determined in accordance with the FTR (except that the rate for depend-ents under 12 years of age is one-half this rate), whether or not the employee or dependents are actually covered by or subject to the FTR. Per diem for an employee and his or her dependents is payable from the date of departure from the evacuated area through the date of arrival at the safe haven, in-cluding any period of delay en route that is beyond an evacuee’s control or that may result from evacuation travel arrangements.

Such subsistence expenses shall begin to be paid on the date fol-lowing arrival and may continue until terminated. The subsistence expenses shall be computed on a daily rate basis, as follows: (1) An agency must compute the ap- plicable maximum per diem rate by using the ‘‘lodgings-plus per diem sys-tem,’’ as defined in the FTR, for the employee and each dependent who is 12 years of age or over. For each depend- ent under 12 years of age, the per diem rate is one-half of the applicable max-imum per diem rate for employees and dependents who are 12 years of age or over. An agency may pay these max-imum rates for a period not to exceed the first 30 days of evacuation. (2) If, after expiration of the 30-day period, the evacuation has not been terminated, the per diem rate shall be computed at 60 percent of the rates prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section until a determination is made by the agency that subsistence ex-penses are no longer authorized. This rate may be paid for a period not to ex-ceed 180 days after the effective date of the order to evacuate. (3) The daily rate of the subsistence expense allowance actually paid an em-ployee shall be either a rate deter-mined in accordance with paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section or a lower rate determined by the agency to be appropriate for necessary living ex-penses. (c) Payment of subsistence expenses shall be decreased by the applicable per-person amount for any period dur-ing which the employee is authorized regular travel per diem in accordance with the FTR.

Fail-ure or refusal to perform assigned work may be a basis for terminating further evacuation payments. (b) When part-time employees are given assigned work at the safe haven, records of the number of hours worked shall be maintained so that payment may be made for any hours of work that are greater than the number of hours on which evacuation payments are computed. (c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of the order to evacuate, or when the emergency or evacuation situation is terminated, whichever is earlier, an employee must be returned to his or her regular duty station, or appropriate action must be taken to re-assign him or her to another duty sta-tion. § 550.407 Termination of payments during evacuation.

This subpart contains Office of Per- sonnel Management (OPM) regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5304, which au-thorizes locality payments in defined geographic areas for GS employees and other categories of employees to whom locality payments are extended. These regulations must be read together with 5 U.S.C. 5304. [70 FR 31302, May 31, 2005] § 531.602 Definitions. In this subpart: CSA means the geographic scope of a Combined Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budg-et (OMB) in OMB Bulletin No. 20–01. Employee means— (1) An employee in a position to which 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III, applies, including a GM employee, and whose official worksite is located in a locality pay area; and (2) An employee in a category of posi- tions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(A)– (D) for which the President (or des-ignee) has authorized locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(2) and whose official worksite is located in a locality pay area. General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system estab-lished under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also re-fers to the pay schedule of GS rates es-tablished under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as ad-justed under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00443 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR434 5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–25 Edition) § 531.602 (including GS rates payable to GM em- ployees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classifica-tion and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS–3 through GS–10. GM employee has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203. GS rate means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding any LEO special base rate and addi-tional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate. Law enforcement officer or LEO has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103. LEO special base rate means a special base rate established for GS law en-forcement officers at grades GS–3 through GS–10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101– 509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate. Locality pay area means an area listed in §531.603 of this part, as established and modified under 5 U.S.C. 5304 by the Pay Agent designated by the President under 5 U.S.C. 5304(d)(1). Locality payment means a locality- based comparability payment payable under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and this subpart. An employee’s locality payment is the dif-ference between the employee’s local-ity rate and the employee’s scheduled annual rate of pay. Locality pay percentage means the percentage authorized for a locality pay area under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or 5304a which is used to compute a locality payment (before applying any max-imum pay limitations under §531.606). Locality rate means a scheduled an- nual rate of pay plus an applicable lo-cality payment. An employee’s locality rate is computed under §531.604. MSA means the geographic scope of a Metropolitan Statistical Area, as de-fined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in OMB Bulletin No. 20– 01. Official worksite means the official lo- cation of an employee’s position of record as determined under §531.605. Position of record means an employ- ee’s official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official work-site)), as documented on the employ-ee’s most recent Notification of Per-sonnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position de-scription. A position to which an em-ployee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee’s separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the posi-tion of record through the date of sepa-ration. Rate range or range means a range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or, for non-GS employees, similar rates under other legal authority. Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range appli-cable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or similar legal authority. Scheduled annual rate of pay means, as applicable— (1) The annual GS rate payable to an employee; (2) An annual LEO special base rate; or (3) For an employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(A)–(D) for which the Presi-dent (or designee) has authorized local-ity payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(2), the annual rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action, exclusive of any locality-based adjustments (including adjustments equivalent to local special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C) or additional pay of any other kind. Special rate means a rate of pay with- in a special rate schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or a similar rate established under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). The term special rate does not include an LEO special base rate.

(a) Agency authority. (1) An agency may use the superior qualifications or special needs pay-setting authority in 5 U.S.C. 5333 to set the payable rate of basic pay for an employee above the minimum rate of the highest applica-ble rate range for the employee’s posi- tion of record. The superior qualifica-tions or special needs pay-setting au-thority may be used for— (i) A first appointment (regardless of tenure) as a civilian employee of the Federal Government; or (ii) A reappointment that is consid- ered a new appointment under 5 U.S.C. 5333 because it meets the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section. (2) An agency may use the superior qualifications and special needs pay- setting authority for a reappointment only when the employee has had a break in service of at least 90 days from the last period of civilian employ-ment with the Federal Government, ex-cept as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an agency may use the superior qualifications and spe-cial needs pay-setting authority for a reappointment without requiring a 90- day break in service if the candidate’s civilian employment with the Federal Government during the 90-day period immediately preceding the appoint-ment was limited to one or more of the following: (i) A time-limited appointment in the competitive or excepted service; (ii) A non-permanent appointment in the competitive or excepted service; (iii) Employment with the govern- ment of the District of Columbia (DC) when the candidate was first appointed by the DC government on or after Oc-tober 1, 1987; (iv) An appointment as an expert or consultant under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and 5 CFR part 304; (v) Employment under a provisional appointment designated under 5 CFR 316.403; (vi) Employment under an Internship Program appointment under §213.3402(a) of this chapter ; or (vii) Employment as a Senior Execu- tive Service limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee (as de-fined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(5) and (a)(6), re-spectively). (4) Service as an employee of a non- appropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) of the Department of Defense or Coast Guard is not considered employ-ment by the Federal Government under this section except for employees cov-ered by §531.216 upon appointment or reappointment ( i.e., employees who move from NAFI position to GS posi-tion with a break in service of 3 days or less and without a change in agency). Employees covered by §531.216 upon ap-pointment or reappointment to a GS position are not eligible to have pay set under the superior qualifications or special needs authority, since their NAFI employment is considered em-ployment by the Federal Government. Otherwise, NAFI employment does not block application of this section. (5) An agency may not apply an ex- ception in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-tion if the candidate’s civilian employ-ment with the Federal Government during the 90-day period immediately preceding the appointment was in one or more of the following types of posi-tions: (i) A position to which an individual is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Sen-ate; (ii) A position in the Senior Execu- tive Service as a noncareer appointee (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(7)); (iii) A position excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, pol-icy-making, or policy-advocating char-acter; (iv) A position to which an individual is appointed by the President without the advice and consent of the Senate; (v) A position designated as the head of an agency, including an agency headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00421 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR412 5 CFR Ch.

(b) Superior qualifications or special needs determination. An agency may set the payable rate of basic pay of a newly appointed employee above the min-imum rate of the grade under this sec-tion if the candidate meets one of the following criteria: (1) The candidate has superior quali- fications. An agency may determine that a candidate has superior qualifica-tions based on the level, type, or qual-ity of the candidate’s skills or com-petencies demonstrated or obtained through experience and/or education, the quality of the candidate’s accom-plishments compared to others in the field, or other factors that support a superior qualifications determination. The candidate’s skills, competencies, experience, education, and/or accom-plishments must be relevant to the re-quirements of the position to be filled. These qualities must be significantly higher than that needed to be mini-mally required for the position and/or be of a more specialized quality com-pared to other candidates; or (2) The candidate fills a special agen- cy need. An agency may determine that a candidate fills a special agency need if the type, level, or quality of skills and competencies or other quali-ties and experiences possessed by the candidate are relevant to the require-ments of the position and are essential to accomplishing an important agency mission, goal, or program activity. A candidate also may meet the special needs criteria by meeting agency work-force needs, as documented in the agen-cy’s strategic human capital plan. (c) Pay rate determination. To deter- mine the step at which to set an em-ployee’s payable rate of basic pay using the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority, an agency must consider: (1) The step at which pay has been set for employees who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the candidate’s skills or competencies or other qualities and ex-periences) and who have been newly ap-pointed to positions that are similar to the candidate’s position (based on the position’s occupational series, grade level, organization, geographic loca-tion, or other job-relevant factors), if applicable; and (2) One or more of the', 'and employees’ com-petencies, the agency has a special need for the employees’ services that makes it essential to retain the em-ployees in their current positions dur-ing a period of time before the closure or relocation of the employees’ office, facility, activity, or organization; and (ii) There is a high risk that a signifi- cant number of the employees in the group would be likely to leave for dif-ferent positions in the Federal service in the absence of a retention incentive. (b) Employee eligibility. An agency may pay a retention incentive to an employee under this section when— (1) The employee holds a position listed in §575.303, and is not excluded by §575.304; (2) The employee’s rating of record (or an official performance appraisal or evaluation under a system not covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 CFR part 430) is at least ‘‘Fully Successful’’ or equivalent; and (3) The agency has provided a general or specific written notice to the em-ployee that his or her position may or would be affected by the closure or re-location of the employee’s office, facil-ity, activity, or organization (e.g., the employee’s position may or would move to a new geographic location or the employee’s position may or would be eliminated). (c) Retention incentive plan and ap- proval levels. Before authorizing a re- tention incentive under this section, an agency must include in its retention incentive plan established under §575.307(a) the conditions and require-ments governing the use of retention incentives under this section for em-ployees who would be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service before the closure or relocation of the employees’ office, facility, activ-ity, or organization, including a des-ignation of the authorized agency offi-cials who may approve retention incen-tives under this section, consistent with the approval requirements in §575.307(b). (d) Approval criteria and written deter- mination. (1) For each determination to pay a retention incentive under this section, an agency must document in writing— (i) The basis for determining the agency has a special need for the em-ployee’s (or group of employees’) serv-ices that makes it essential to retain the employee(s), based on the agency’s mission needs and the employee’s (or group of employees’) competencies, during a period of time before the clo-sure or relocation of the employee’s (or group of employees’) office, facility, ac-tivity, or organization; (ii) The basis for determining, in the absence of a retention incentive, the employee (or a significant number of employees in a group) would be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service; and (iii) The basis for establishing the amount and timing of the approved re-tention incentive payment and the length of the required service period. (2) An agency must address the fol- lowing factors when documenting the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for an individual em-ployee: (i) The factors for authorizing a re- tention incentive for an individual em-ployee described in §575.306(b) as they relate to a determination made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; VerDate Sep<11>2014 14:38 May 14, 2025 Jkt 265008 PO 00000 Frm 00761 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\265008.XXX 265008medwards on DSK11XQN23PROD with CFR752 5 CFR Ch.

(3) An agency must address the fol- lowing factors when documenting the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section for a group or cat-egory of employees: (i) The factors for authorizing a re- tention incentive for a group or cat-egory of employees described in §575.306(c) as they relate to the deter-mination made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and (ii) The factors in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(2)(iv) of this sec-tion as they relate to the determina-tion made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the group or category of employees. (4) An agency must narrowly define a targeted category of employees using factors that relate to the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The factors that may be appro-priate are described in §575.306(c)(2), except that each group retention incen-tive authorized under this section may cover no more than one occupational series. (e) Payment of retention incentives. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the provisions regard- ing computing and paying retention in-centives under §575.309 apply to com-puting and paying retention incentives under this section for employees who would be likely to leave for a different position in the Federal service before the closure or relocation of the their office, facility, activity, or organiza-tion. (2) An agency may not pay retention incentives under this section in bi-weekly installments at the full reten-tion incentive percentage rate estab-lished for the employee under §575.309(a).

This exemption is claimed be-cause portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual quali-fications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the ob-jectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process. (ii) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4) is exempt from the re-quirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to or amendment of the records by the data subject.

The Office may refuse access to information com-piled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. [53 FR 1998, Jan. 26, 1988,']",5,"The context provides a comprehensive and explicit section (§550.407) that precisely details the exact conditions under which evacuation payments for a federal employee will terminate, covering scenarios such as reassignment, separation from position, transfer to retirement, resuming original duties, or agency determination that payments are no longer warranted.",4,"This question is highly relevant to federal employment regulations and addresses a specific scenario that could impact federal employees during emergency situations. The question focuses on evacuation payments, which are an important aspect of employee protection and compensation during critical events. 

The practicality of this question is strong, as it relates to emergency preparedness and employee rights during extraordinary circumstances. HR specialists, managers, and federal employees would find this information crucial for understanding their entitlements and obligations during potential evacuation scenarios.

The topic falls directly under Title 5 regulations concerning employee benefits and protections during emergencies. It demonstrates a genuine need for precise information about the termination of evacuation payments, which could have significant financial and logistical implications for federal workers.

The question is particularly applicable for:
- HR professionals managing emergency response protocols
- Federal employees concerned about their compensation during evacuations
- Managers responsible for understanding employee support during critical situations
- Risk management and compliance teams

While not a universally applicable question, it addresses a specific but important niche of federal employment policy, making it a valuable inquiry for those potentially affected by emergency evacuation procedures."
