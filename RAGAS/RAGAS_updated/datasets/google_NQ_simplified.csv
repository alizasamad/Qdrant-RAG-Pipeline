Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic princess of the underworld , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead . Persephone was married to Hades , the god of the underworld . The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of vegetation , which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest ; hence , she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation . Similar myths appear in the Orient , in the cults of male gods like Attis , Adonis , and Osiris , and in Minoan Crete . </P> <P> Persephone as a vegetation goddess and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the Eleusinian mysteries , which promised the initiated a more enjoyable prospect after death . In some versions , Persephone is the mother of Zeus 's sons Dionysus , Iacchus , or Zagreus . The origins of her cult are uncertain , but it was based on very old agrarian cults of agricultural communities . </P> <P> Persephone was commonly worshipped along with Demeter and with the same mysteries . To her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of Anthesterion . In Classical Greek art , Persephone is invariably portrayed robed , often carrying a sheaf of grain . She may appear as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box , but she was mostly represented in the process of being carried off by Hades . </P> <P> In Roman mythology , she is called Proserpina , and her mother , Ceres and her father Jupiter . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Name <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 1.2 Roman Proserpina </Li> <Li> 1.3 Nestis </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Titles and functions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Epithets </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Origins of the cult <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Near East and Minoan Crete </Li> <Li> 3.2 Mycenean Greece </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Mythology <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Abduction myth </Li> <Li> 4.2 Interpretation of the myth </Li> <Li> 4.3 Arcadian myths </Li> <Li> 4.4 Queen of the Underworld </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Cult of Persephone <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Thesmophoria </Li> <Li> 5.2 Eleusinian mysteries </Li> <Li> 5.3 Local cults </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Ancient literary references </Li> <Li> 7 Modern reception </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes and references </Li> <Li> 10 Sources </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Name ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Etymology ( edit ) </H3> Persephone or `` the deceased woman '' holding a pomegranate . Etruscan terracotta cinerary statue . National archaeological museum in Palermo , Italy <P> In a Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) inscription on a tablet found at Pylos dated 1400 -- 1200 BC , John Chadwick reconstructed the name of a goddess * Preswa who could be identified with Persa , daughter of Oceanus and found speculative the further identification with the first element of Persephone . Persephonē ( Greek : Περσεφόνη ) is her name in the Ionic Greek of epic literature . The Homeric form of her name is Persephoneia ( Περσεφονεία , Persephoneia ) . In other dialects , she was known under variant names : Persephassa ( Περσεφάσσα ) , Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα ) , or simply Korē ( Κόρη , `` girl , maiden '' ) . Plato calls her Pherepapha ( Φερέπαφα ) in his Cratylus , `` because she is wise and touches that which is in motion '' . There are also the forms Periphona ( Πηριφόνα ) and Phersephassa ( Φερσέφασσα ) . The existence of so many different forms shows how difficult it was for the Greeks to pronounce the word in their own language and suggests that the name may have a Pre-Greek origin . </P> <P> Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα ) is considered to mean `` female thresher of grain '' ; the first constituent of the name originates in Proto - Greek `` perso - '' ( related to Sanskrit `` parṣa - '' ) , `` sheaf of grain '' and the second constituent of the name originates in Proto - Indo European * - gwn - t - ih , from the root * gwhen - `` to strike '' . </P> <P> An alternative etymology is from φέρειν φόνον , pherein phonon , `` to bring ( or cause ) death '' . </P> <H3> Roman Proserpina ( edit ) </H3> Cinerary altar with tabula representing the rape of Proserpina . White marble , Antonine Era , 2nd century Rome , Baths of Diocletian Persephone opening a cista containing the infant Adonis , on a pinax from Locri <P> The Romans first heard of her from the Aeolian and Dorian cities of Magna Graecia , who used the dialectal variant Proserpinē ( Προσερπίνη ) . Hence , in Roman mythology she was called Proserpina , a name erroneously derived by the Romans from proserpere , `` to shoot forth '' and as such became an emblematic figure of the Renaissance . </P> <P> At Locri , perhaps uniquely , Persephone was the protector of marriage , a role usually assumed by Hera ; in the iconography of votive plaques at Locri , her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an emblem of the marital state , children at Locri were dedicated to Proserpina , and maidens about to be wed brought their peplos to be blessed . </P> <H3> Nestis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a Classical period text ascribed to Empedocles , c. 490 -- 430 BC , describing a correspondence among four deities and the classical elements , the name Nestis for water apparently refers to Persephone : `` Now hear the fourfold roots of everything : enlivening Hera , Hades , shining Zeus . And Nestis , moistening mortal springs with tears . '' </P> <P> Of the four deities of Empedocles ' elements , it is the name of Persephone alone that is taboo -- Nestis is a euphemistic cult title -- for she was also the terrible Queen of the Dead , whose name was not safe to speak aloud , who was euphemistically named simply as Kore or `` the Maiden '' , a vestige of her archaic role as the deity ruling the underworld . </P> <H2> Titles and functions ( edit ) </H2> <P> The epithets of Persephone reveal her double function as chthonic and vegetation goddess . The surnames given to her by the poets refer to her character as Queen of the lower world and the dead , or her symbolic meaning of the power that shoots forth and withdraws into the earth . Her common name as a vegetation goddess is Kore , and in Arcadia she was worshipped under the title Despoina , `` the mistress '' , a very old chthonic divinity . Plutarch identifies her with spring and Cicero calls her the seed of the fruits of the fields . In the Eleusinian mysteries , her return is the symbol of immortality and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi . </P> <P> In the mystical theories of the Orphics and the Platonists , Kore is described as the all - pervading goddess of nature who both produces and destroys everything , and she is therefore mentioned along or identified with other mystic divinities such as Isis , Rhea , Ge , Hestia , Pandora , Artemis , and Hecate . The Orphic Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus , Iacchus , Zagreus , and the little - attested Melinoe . </P> <H3> Epithets ( edit ) </H3> <P> As a goddess of the underworld , Persephone was given euphemistically friendly names . However it is possible that some of them were the names of original goddesses : </P> <Ul> <Li> Despoina ( dems - potnia ) `` the mistress '' ( literally `` the mistress of the house '' ) in Arcadia . </Li> <Li> Hagne , `` pure '' , originally a goddess of the springs in Messenia . </Li> <Li> Melindia or Melinoia ( meli , `` honey '' ) , as the consort of Hades , in Hermione . ( Compare Hecate , Melinoe ) </Li> <Li> Melivia </Li> <Li> Melitodes </Li> <Li> Aristi cthonia , `` the best chthonic '' . </Li> <Li> Praxidike , the Orphic Hymn to Persephone identifies Praxidike as an epithet of Persephone : `` Praxidike , subterranean queen . The Eumenides ' source ( mother ) , fair - haired , whose frame proceeds from Zeus ' ineffable and secret seeds .

Depicted are female figures dancing among blossoming vegetation ; Heraklion Archaeological Museum <P> The myth of a goddess being abducted and taken to the Underworld is probably Pre-Greek in origin . Samuel Noah Kramer , the renowned scholar of ancient Sumer , has posited that the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone may be derived from an ancient Sumerian story in which Ereshkigal , the ancient Sumerian goddess of the Underworld , is abducted by Kur , the primeval dragon of Sumerian mythology , and forced to become ruler of the Underworld against her own will . </P> <P> The location of Persephone 's abduction is different in each local cult . The Homeric Hymn to Demeter mentions the `` plain of Nysa '' . The locations of this probably mythical place may simply be conventions to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past . Demeter found and met her daughter in Eleusis , and this is the mythical disguise of what happened in the mysteries . </P> <P> Persephone is an old chthonic deity of the agricultural communities , who received the souls of the dead into the earth , and acquired powers over the fertility of the soil , over which she reigned . The earliest depiction of a goddess who may be identified with Persephone growing out of the ground , is on a plate from the Old - Palace period in Phaistos . The goddess has a vegetable - like appearance , and she is surrounded by dancing girls between blossoming flowers . A similar representation , where the goddess appears to come down from the sky , is depicted on the Minoan ring of Isopata . </P> Rape of Persephone . Hades with his horses and Persephone ( down ) . An Apulian red - figure volute krater , c. 340 BC . Antikensammlung Berlin <P> In some forms Hades appears with his chthonic horses . The myth of the rape of Kore was derived from the idea that Hades catches the souls of the dead and then carries them with his horses into his kingdom . This idea is vague in Homer , but appears in later Greek depictions , and in Greek folklore . `` Charos '' appears with his horse and carries the dead into the underworld . </P> <P> The cults of Persephone and Demeter in the Eleusinian mysteries and in the Thesmophoria were based on old agrarian cults . A lot of ancient beliefs were based on initiation into jealously - guarded mysteries ( secret rites ) because they offered prospects after death more enjoyable than the final end at the gloomy space of the Greek Hades . There is evidence that some practices were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenaean age . Kerenyi asserts that these religious practices were introduced from Minoan Crete. , The idea of immortality which appears in the syncretistic religions of the Near East did not exist in the Eleusinian mysteries at the very beginning . </P> <H3> Near east and Minoan Crete ( edit ) </H3> Lady of Auxerre Louvre - An Archaic ( 640 BC ) image from Crete . A version of a Minoan goddess who may be identified with Kore <P> In the Near eastern myth of the early agricultural societies , every year the fertility goddess bore the `` god of the new year '' , who then became her lover , and died immediately in order to be reborn and face the same destiny . Some findings from Catal Huyuk since the Neolithic age , indicate the worship of the Great Goddess accompanied by a boyish consort , who symbolizes the annual decay and return of vegetation . Similar cults of resurrected gods appear in the Near East and Egypt in the cults of Attis , Adonis and Osiris . </P> <P> In Minoan Crete , the `` divine child '' was related to the female vegetation divinity Ariadne who died every year . The Minoan religion had its own characteristics . The most peculiar feature of the Minoan belief in the divine , is the appearance of the goddess from above in the dance . Dance floors have been discovered in addition to `` vaulted tombs '' , and it seems that the dance was ecstatic . Homer memorializes the dance floor which Daedalus built for Ariadne in the remote past . On the gold ring from Isopata , four women in festal attire are performing a dance between blossoming flowers . Above a figure apparently floating in the air seems to be the goddess herself , appearing amid the whirling dance . An image plate from the first palace of Phaistos , seems to be very close to the mythical image of the Anodos ( ascent ) of Persephone . Two girls dance between blossoming flowers , on each side of a similar but armless and legless figure which seems to grow out of the ground . The goddess is bordered by snake lines which give her a vegetable like appearance She has a large stylized flower turned over her head . The resemblance with the flower - picking Persephone and her companions is compelling . The depiction of the goddess is similar to later images of `` Anodos of Pherephata '' . On the Dresden vase , Persephone is growing out of the ground , and she is surrounded by the animal - tailed agricultural gods Silenoi . </P> <P> Kerenyi suggests that the name Ariadne ( derived from ἁγνή , hagne , `` pure '' ) , was an euphemistical name given by the Greeks to the nameless `` Mistress of the labyrinth '' who appears in a Mycenean Greek inscription from Knossos in Crete . The Greeks used to give friendly names to the deities of the underworld . Cthonic Zeus was called Eubuleus , `` the good counselor '' , and the ferryman of the river of the underworld Charon , `` glad '' . Despoina and `` Hagne '' were probably euphemistic surnames of Persephone , therefore he theorizes that the cult of Persephone was the continuation of the worship of a Minoan Great goddess . The labyrinth was both a winding dance - ground and , in the Greek view , a prison with the dreaded Minotaur at its centre . It is possible that some religious practices , especially the mysteries , were transferred from a Cretan priesthood to Eleusis , where Demeter brought the poppy from Crete . Besides these similarities , Burkert explains that up to now it is not known to what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenean religion . In the Anthesteria Dionysos is the `` divine child '' . </P> <H3> Mycenean Greece ( edit ) </H3> Two women or goddesses on a chariot . Fresco from Tiryns , 1200 BC . National Archaeological Museum of Athens . <P> There is evidence of a cult in Eleusis from the Mycenean period ; however , there are not sacral finds from this period . The cult was private and there is no information about it . As well as the names of some Greek gods in the Mycenean Greek inscriptions , also appear names of goddesses , like `` the divine Mother '' ( the mother of the gods ) or `` the Goddess ( or priestess ) of the winds '' , who do n't have Mycenean origin . In historical times , Demeter and Kore were usually referred to as `` the goddesses '' or `` the mistresses '' ( Arcadia ) in the mysteries . In the Mycenean Greek tablets dated 1400 -- 1200 BC , the `` two queens and the king '' are mentioned . John Chadwick believes that these were the precursor divinities of Demeter , Persephone and Poseidon . </P> <P> Some information can be obtained from the study of the cult of Eileithyia at Crete , and the cult of Despoina . In the cave of Amnisos at Crete , Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with Enesidaon ( The earth shaker ) , who is the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon . Persephone was conflated with Despoina , `` the mistress '' , a chthonic divinity in West - Arcadia . The megaron of Eleusis is quite similar with the `` megaron '' of Despoina at Lycosura . Demeter is united with the god Poseidon , and she bears a daughter , the unnameable Despoina . Poseidon appears as a horse , as it usually happens in Northern European folklore . The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult , where the following words were uttered `` Mighty Potnia bore a great sun '' . In Eleusis , in a ritual , one child ( `` pais '' ) was initiated from the hearth . The name pais ( the divine child ) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions , and the ritual indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the Greek cremation . </P> <P> In Greek mythology Nysa is a mythical mountain with an unknown location . Nysion ( or Mysion ) , the place of the abduction of Persephone was also probably a mythical place which did not exist on the map , a magically distant chthonic land of myth which was intended in the remote past . </P> <H2> Mythology ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Abduction myth ( edit ) </H3> Sarcophagus with the abduction of Persephone . Walters Art Museum . Baltimore , Maryland <P> The story of her abduction by Hades against her will is traditionally referred to as the Rape of Persephone . It is mentioned briefly in Hesiod 's Theogony , and told in considerable detail in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter . Persephone used to live far away from the other gods , a goddess within Nature herself before the days of planting seeds and nurturing plants . In the Olympian telling , the gods Hermes and Apollo had wooed Persephone ; but Demeter rejected all their gifts and hid her daughter away from the company of the Olympian gods . Zeus , it is said , permitted Hades , who was in love with the beautiful Persephone , to abduct her as her mother Demeter was not likely to allow her daughter to go down to Hades . Persephone was gathering flowers with the Oceanids along with Artemis and Athena -- the Homeric Hymn says -- in a field when Hades came to abduct her , bursting through a cleft in the earth . Demeter , when she found her daughter had disappeared , searched for her all over the earth with Hecate 's torches . In most versions she forbids the earth to produce , or she neglects the earth and in the depth of her despair she causes nothing to grow . Helios , the sun , who sees everything , eventually told Demeter what had happened and at length she discovered the place of her abode . Finally , Zeus , pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish , forced Hades to return Persephone . </P> The Rape of Proserpina by Gian Lorenzo Bernini at the Galleria Borghese in Rome . <P> Hades indeed complied with the request , but first he tricked her , giving her some pomegranate seeds to eat . Persephone was released by Hermes , who had been sent to retrieve her , but because she had tasted food in the underworld , she was obliged to spend a third of each year ( the winter months ) there , and the remaining part of the year with the gods above . With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus , Persephone 's time in the underworld becomes half the year . </P> <P> Various local traditions place Persephone 's abduction in a different location . The Sicilians , among whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists , believed that Hades found her in the meadows near Enna , and that a well arose on the spot where he descended with her into the lower world . The Cretans thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape , and the Eleusinians mentioned the Nysian plain in Boeotia , and said that Persephone had descended with Hades into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus . Later accounts place the rape in Attica , near Athens , or near Eleusis . </P> The return of Persephone , by Frederic Leighton ( 1891 ) <P> The Homeric hymn mentions the Nysion ( or Mysion ) which was probably a mythical place . The location of this mythical place may simply be a convention to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past . Before Persephone was abducted by Hades , the shepherd Eumolpus and the swineherd Eubuleus saw a girl in a black chariot driven by an invisible driver being carried off into the earth which had violently opened up . Eubuleus was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her , and the myth is an etiology for the relation of pigs with the ancient rites in Thesmophoria , and in Eleusis . </P> <P> In the hymn , Persephone returns and she is reunited with her mother near Eleusis . Demeter as she has been promised established her mysteries ( orgies ) when the Eleusinians built for her a temple near the spring of Callichorus . These were awful mysteries which were not allowed to be uttered . The uninitiated would spend a miserable existence in the gloomy space of Hades after death . </P> <P> In some versions , Ascalaphus informed the other deities that Persephone had eaten the pomegranate seeds . When Demeter and her daughter were reunited , the Earth flourished with vegetation and color , but for some months each year , when Persephone returned to the underworld , the earth once again became a barren realm . This is an origin story to explain the seasons . </P> <P> In an earlier version , Hecate rescued Persephone . On an Attic red - figured bell krater of c. 440 BC in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Persephone is rising as if up stairs from a cleft in the earth , while Hermes stands aside ; Hecate , holding two torches , looks back as she leads her to the enthroned Demeter . </P> <P> The 10th - century Byzantine encyclopedia Suda introduces a goddess of a blessed afterlife assured to Orphic mystery initiates . This Macaria is asserted to be the daughter of Hades , but no mother is mentioned . </P> <H3> Interpretation of the myth ( edit ) </H3> Pinax of Persephone and Hades from Locri . Reggio Calabria , National Museum of Magna Graecia . <P> In the myth Pluto abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm . Pluto ( Πλούτων , Ploutōn ) was a name for the ruler of the underworld ; the god was also known as Hades , a name for the underworld itself . The name Pluton was conflated with that of Ploutos ( Πλούτος Ploutos , `` wealth '' ) , a god of wealth , because mineral wealth was found underground , and because Pluto as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest . Plouton is lord of the dead , but as Persephone 's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility . </P> <P> In the Theogony of Hesiod , Demeter was united with the hero Iasion in Crete and she bore Ploutos . This union seems to be a reference to a hieros gamos ( ritual copulation ) to ensure the earth 's fertility . This ritual copulation appears in Minoan Crete , in many Near Eastern agricultural societies , and also in the Anthesteria . </P> <P> Nilsson believes that the original cult of Ploutos ( or Pluto ) in Eleusis was similar with the Minoan cult of the `` divine child '' , who died in order to be reborn . The child was abandoned by his mother and then it was brought up by the powers of nature . Similar myths appear in the cults of Hyakinthos ( Amyklai ) , Erichthonios ( Athens ) , and later in the cult of Dionysos . </P> <P> The Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain -- important and rare in the Greek environment -- and the return ( ascent ) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing . Pluto ( Ploutos ) represents the wealth of the grain that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars ( pithoi ) , during summer months . Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for burials and Pluto is fused with Hades , the King of the realm of the dead . During summer months , the Greek grain - Maiden ( Kore ) is lying in the grain of the underground silos in the realm of Hades , and she is fused with Persephone , the Queen of the Underworld . At the beginning of the autumn , when the seeds of the old crop are laid on the fields , she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter , for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other . For the initiated , this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life that flows from the generations which spring from each other . </P> <H3> Arcadian myths ( edit ) </H3> From L-R , Artemis , Demeter , Veil of Despoina , Anytus , Tritoness from the throne of Despoina at Lycosura . National Archaeological Museum of Athens <P> The primitive myths of isolated Arcadia seem to be related to the first Greek - speaking people who came from the north - east during the bronze age . Despoina ( the mistress ) , the goddess of the Arcadian mysteries , is the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios ( horse ) , who represents the river spirit of the underworld that appears as a horse as often happens in northern - European folklore . He pursues the mare - Demeter and from the union she bears the horse Arion and a daughter who originally had the form or the shape of a mare . The two goddesses were not clearly separated and they were closely connected with the springs and the animals . They were related with the god of rivers and springs ; Poseidon and especially with Artemis , the Mistress of the Animals who was the first nymph . According to the Greek tradition a hunt - goddess preceded the harvest goddess . In Arcadia , Demeter and Persephone were often called Despoinai ( Δέσποιναι , `` the mistresses '' ) in historical times . They are the two Great Goddesses of the Arcadian cults , and evidently they come from a more primitive religion . The Greek god Poseidon probably substituted the companion ( Paredros , Πάρεδρος ) of the Minoan Great goddess in the Arcadian mysteries . </P> Seated goddess , probably Persephone on her throne in the underworld , Severe style ca 480 -- 60 , found at Tarentum , Magna Graecia ( Pergamon Museum , Berlin ) <H3> Queen of the underworld ( edit ) </H3> <P> Persephone held an ancient role as the dread queen of the Underworld , within which tradition it was forbidden to speak her name . This tradition comes from her conflation with the very old chthonic divinity Despoina ( the mistress ) , whose real name could not be revealed to anyone except those initiated to her mysteries . As goddess of death she was also called a daughter of Zeus and Styx , the river that formed the boundary between Earth and the underworld . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic queen of the shades , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead , along with her husband Hades . In the reformulation of Greek mythology expressed in the Orphic Hymns , Dionysus and Melinoe are separately called children of Zeus and Persephone . Groves sacred to her stood at the western extremity of the earth on the frontiers of the lower world , which itself was called `` house of Persephone '' . </P> <P> Her central myth served as the context for the secret rites of regeneration at Eleusis , which promised immortality to initiates . </P> <H2> Cult of Persephone ( edit ) </H2> <P> Persephone was worshipped along with her mother Demeter and in the same mysteries . Her cults included agrarian magic , dancing , and rituals . The priests used special vessels and holy symbols , and the people participated with rhymes . In Eleusis there is evidence of sacred laws and other inscriptions . </P> <P> The Cult of Demeter and the Maiden is found at Attica , in the main festivals Thesmophoria and Eleusinian mysteries and in a lot of local cults . These festivals were almost always celebrated at the autumn sowing , and at full - moon according to the Greek tradition . In some local cults the feasts were dedicated to Demeter . </P> <H3> Thesmophoria ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Thesmophoria Kore , daughter of Demeter , celebrated with her mother by the Thesmophoriazusae ( women of the festival ) . Acropolis Museum , Athens <P> Thesmophoria , were celebrated in Athens , and the festival was widely spread in Greece . This was a festival of secret women - only rituals connected with marriage customs and commemorated the third of the year , in the month Pyanepsion , when Kore was abducted and Demeter abstained from her role as goddess of harvest and growth . The ceremony involved sinking sacrifices into the earth by night and retrieving the decaying remains of pigs that had been placed in the megara of Demeter ( trenches and pits or natural clefts in rock ) , the previous year . These were placed on altars , mixed with seeds , then planted . Pits rich in organic matter at Eleusis have been taken as evidence that the Thesmophoria was held there as well as in other demes of Attica . This agrarian magic was also used in the cult of the earth - goddesses potniai ( mistresses ) in the Cabeirian , and in Knidos . </P> <P> The festival was celebrated over three days . The first was the `` way up '' to the sacred space , the second , the day of feasting when they ate pomegranate seeds and the third was a meat feast in celebration of Kalligeneia a goddess of beautiful birth . Zeus penetrated the mysteries as Zeus - Eubuleus which is an euphemistical name of Hades ( Chthonios Zeus ) . In the original myth which is an etiology for the ancient rites , Eubuleus was a swineherd who was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her . </P> <H3> Eleusinian mysteries ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Eleusinian mysteries The Eleusinian trio : Persephone , Triptolemus and Demeter on a marble bas - relief from Eleusis , 440 -- 430 BC . National Archaeological Museum of Athens <P> The Eleusinian mysteries was a festival celebrated at the autumn sowing in the city of Eleusis . Inscriptions refer to `` the Goddesses '' accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemos ( probably son of Ge and Oceanus ) , and `` the God and the Goddess '' ( Persephone and Plouton ) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld . The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases : the `` descent '' , the `` search '' , and the `` ascent '' , with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation . The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter . The festival activities included dancing , probably across the Rharian field , where according to the myth the first grain grew . </P> <P> At the beginning of the feast , the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out , the one towards the west , and the other towards the east . The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme `` rain and conceive '' . In a ritual , a child was initiated from the hearth ( the divine fire ) . It was the ritual of the `` divine child '' who originally was Ploutos . In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos The high point of the celebration was `` an ear of grain cut in silence '' , which represented the force of the new life . The idea of immortality did n't exist in the mysteries at the beginning , but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld . Death remained a reality , but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed . In the earliest depictions Persephone is an armless and legless deity , who grows out of the ground . </P> <H3> Local cults ( edit ) </H3> A mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto , 4th century BC Hades abducting Persephone , wall painting in the small royal tomb at Vergina .

The Thebans told Pausanias that some inhabitants of Naupactus had performed the same rituals there , and had met with divine vengeance . The Cabeirian mysteries were introduced from Asia Minor at the end of the archaic period . Nothing is known of the older cult , and it seems that the Cabeiri were originally wine - daemons . Inscriptions from the temple in Thebes mention the old one as Cabir , and the new one as son ( pais ) , who are different .

In 1961 , Frederick Ashton of the Royal Ballet appropriated Stravinsky 's score , to choreograph a ballet starring Svetlana Beriosova as Persephone . </P> <P> Persephone also appears many times in popular culture . Featured in a variety of young adult novels such as `` Persephone '' by Kaitlin Bevis , `` Persephone 's Orchard '' by Molly Ringle , `` The Goddess Test '' by Aimee Carter , `` The Goddess Letters '' by Carol Orlock , and `` Abandon '' by Meg Cabot , her story has also been treated by Suzanne Banay Santo in `` Persephone Under the Earth '' in the light of women 's spirituality . Here Santo treats the mythic elements in terms of maternal sacrifice to the burgeoning sexuality of an adolescent daughter . Accompanied by the classic , sensual paintings of Frederic Lord Leighton and William - Adolphe Bouguereau , Santo portrays Persephone not as a victim but as a woman in quest of sexual depth and power , transcending the role of daughter , though ultimately returning to it as an awakened Queen . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Greek mythology portal </Li> <Li> Hellenismos portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Eleusinian Mysteries </Li> <Li> Rape of Persephone </Li> <Li> Anthesphoria , festival honoring Proserpina , and Persephone </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes and references ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Notes </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The actual word in Linear B is 𐀟𐀩𐁚 , pe - re - * 82 or pe - re-swa ; it is found on the PY Tn 316 tablet . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Empedocles was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher who was a citizen of Agrigentum , a Greek colony in Sicily . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kingsley 1995 identifies Nestis as a cult title of Persephone . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hom .

It is an ancient , monotheistic , Abrahamic religion with the Torah as its foundational text . It encompasses the religion , philosophy , and culture of the Jewish people . Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel . Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts , practices , theological positions , and forms of organization . The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide , Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world . </P> <P> Within Judaism there are a variety of movements , most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism , which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah . Historically , this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period ; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period ; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations . Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic . Today , the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism ( Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism ) , Conservative Judaism , and Reform Judaism . Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law , the authority of the Rabbinic tradition , and the significance of the State of Israel . Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin , eternal and unalterable , and that they should be strictly followed . Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal , with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism 's requirements than Reform Judaism . A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews . Historically , special courts enforced Jewish law ; today , these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary . Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization , but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them . </P> <P> The history of Judaism spans more than 3,000 years . Judaism has its roots as an organized religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age . Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions . The Hebrews and Israelites were already referred to as `` Jews '' in later books of the Tanakh such as the Book of Esther , with the term Jews replacing the title `` Children of Israel '' . Judaism 's texts , traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions , including Christianity , Islam and the Baha'i Faith . Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced secular Western ethics and civil law . Hebraism was just as important a factor in the ancient era development of Western civilization as Hellenism , and Judaism , as the background of Christianity , has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since Early Christianity . </P> <P> Jews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish , in addition to converts to Judaism . In 2015 , the world Jewish population was estimated at about 14.3 million , or roughly 0.2 % of the total world population . About 43 % of all Jews reside in Israel and another 43 % reside in the United States and Canada , with most of the remainder living in Europe , and other minority groups spread throughout Latin America , Asia , Africa , and Australia . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Defining characteristics and principles of faith <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Defining characteristics </Li> <Li> 1.2 Core tenets </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Jewish religious texts <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Jewish legal literature </Li> <Li> 2.2 Jewish philosophy </Li> <Li> 2.3 Rabbinic hermeneutics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Jewish identity <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Origin of the term `` Judaism '' </Li> <Li> 3.2 Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism </Li> <Li> 3.3 Who is a Jew ? </Li> <Li> 3.4 Jewish demographics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Jewish religious movements <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Rabbinic Judaism <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Jewish movements in Israel </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.2 Karaites and Samaritans </Li> <Li> 4.3 Haymanot ( Ethiopian Judaism ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Jewish observances <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Jewish ethics </Li> <Li> 5.2 Prayers </Li> <Li> 5.3 Religious clothing </Li> <Li> 5.4 Jewish holidays <Ul> <Li> 5.4. 1 Shabbat </Li> <Li> 5.4. 2 Three pilgrimage festivals </Li> <Li> 5.4. 3 High Holy Days </Li> <Li> 5.4. 4 Purim </Li> <Li> 5.4. 5 Hanukkah </Li> <Li> 5.4. 6 Fast days </Li> <Li> 5.4. 7 Israeli holidays </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.5 Torah readings </Li> <Li> 5.6 Synagogues and religious buildings </Li> <Li> 5.7 Dietary laws : kashrut </Li> <Li> 5.8 Laws of ritual purity <Ul> <Li> 5.8. 1 Family purity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.9 Life - cycle events </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Community leadership <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Classical priesthood </Li> <Li> 6.2 Prayer leaders </Li> <Li> 6.3 Specialized religious roles </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 History <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Origins </Li> <Li> 7.2 Antiquity </Li> <Li> 7.3 Historical Jewish groupings ( to 1700 ) </Li> <Li> 7.4 Persecutions </Li> <Li> 7.5 Hasidism </Li> <Li> 7.6 The Enlightenment and new religious movements </Li> <Li> 7.7 Spectrum of observance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Judaism and other religions <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Christianity and Judaism </Li> <Li> 8.2 Islam and Judaism </Li> <Li> 8.3 Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Defining characteristics and principles of faith </H2> <H3> Defining characteristics </H3> Glass platter inscribed with the Hebrew word zokhreinu -- ( god ) remember us A 19th - century silver Macedonian Hanukkah menorah <P> Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods , the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary ; consequently , the Hebrew God 's principal relationships are not with other gods , but with the world , and more specifically , with the people he created . Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism : the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind . According to the Tanakh ( Hebrew Bible ) , God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation . Many generations later , he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God ; that is , the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God 's concern for the world . He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another ; that is , Jews are to imitate God 's love for people . These commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant , which is the substance of Judaism . </P> <P> Thus , although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism ( Kabbalah ) , Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as `` normal mysticism '' , because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews . This is played out through the observance of the Halakha ( Jewish law ) and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha - Mizvot , the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled . </P> <Dl> <Dd> The ordinary , familiar , everyday things and occurrences we have , constitute occasions for the experience of God . Such things as one 's daily sustenance , the very day itself , are felt as manifestations of God 's loving - kindness , calling for the Berakhot . Kedushah , holiness , which is nothing else than the imitation of God , is concerned with daily conduct , with being gracious and merciful , with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry , adultery , and the shedding of blood . The Birkat Ha - Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite , but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character , while the several holy objects are non-theurgic . And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God . Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience , evil as well as good , for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings . Hence , although the experience of God is like none other , the occasions for experiencing Him , for having a consciousness of Him , are manifold , even if we consider only those that call for Berakot . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Whereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent , and whether people have free will or their lives are determined , Halakha is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world . </P> <P> Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism . However , monotheism has not always been followed in practice . The Jewish Bible ( Tanakh ) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel . In the Greco - Roman era , many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism , including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity . </P> <P> Moreover , some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God . For some , observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God per se . In modern times , some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history . The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians . </P> <H3> Core tenets </H3> Main article : Jewish principles of faith 13 Principles of Faith : <Ol> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , is the Creator and Guide of everything that has been created ; He alone has made , does make , and will make all things . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , is One , and that there is no unity in any manner like His , and that He alone is our God , who was , and is , and will be . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , has no body , and that He is free from all the properties of matter , and that there can be no ( physical ) comparison to Him whatsoever . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , is the first and the last . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that to the Creator , Blessed be His Name , and to Him alone , it is right to pray , and that it is not right to pray to any being besides Him . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that all the words of the prophets are true . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the prophecy of Moses our teacher , peace be upon him , was true , and that he was the chief of the prophets , both those who preceded him and those who followed him . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah that is now in our possession is the same that was given to Moses our teacher , peace be upon him . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that this Torah will not be exchanged , and that there will never be any other Torah from the Creator , Blessed be His Name . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , knows all the deeds of human beings and all their thoughts , as it is written , `` Who fashioned the hearts of them all , Who comprehends all their actions '' ( Psalms 33 : 15 ) . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that the Creator , Blessed be His Name , rewards those who keep His commandments and punishes those that transgress them . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah ; and even though he may tarry , nonetheless , I wait every day for his coming . </Li> <Li> I believe with perfect faith that there will be a revival of the dead at the time when it shall please the Creator , Blessed be His name , and His mention shall be exalted for ever and ever . </Li> </Ol> <P> -- Maimonides </P> <P> Scholars throughout Jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism 's core tenets , all of which have met with criticism . The most popular formulation is Maimonides ' thirteen principles of faith , developed in the 12th century . According to Maimonides , any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic . Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides ' principles . </P> <P> In Maimonides ' time , his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo . Albo and the Raavad argued that Maimonides ' principles contained too many items that , while true , were not fundamentals of the faith . </P> <P> Along these lines , the ancient historian Josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs , associating apostasy with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs . Maimonides ' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries . Later , two poetic restatements of these principles ( `` Ani Ma'amin '' and `` Yigdal '' ) became integrated into many Jewish liturgies , leading to their eventual near - universal acceptance . </P> <P> In modern times , Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma . Because of this , many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism . Even so , all Jewish religious movements are , to a greater or lesser extent , based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible and various commentaries such as the Talmud and Midrash . Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses , who is considered Judaism 's greatest prophet . In the Mishnah , a core text of Rabbinic Judaism , acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the World to Come . </P> <P> Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult , given the number and diversity of the contemporary Jewish denominations . Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century , the matter remains complicated . Thus for instance , Joseph Soloveitchik 's ( associated with the Modern Orthodox movement ) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the halakha whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world . Mordecai Kaplan , the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism , abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas , he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible . In turn , Solomon Schechter 's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah , in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation . Finally , David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement . </P> <H2> Jewish religious texts </H2> <P> The following is a basic , structured list of the central works of Jewish practice and thought . </P> <Ul> <Li> Tanakh ( Hebrew Bible ) and Rabbinic literature <Ul> <Li> Mesorah </Li> <Li> Targum </Li> <Li> Jewish Biblical exegesis ( also see Midrash below ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Works of the Talmudic Era ( classic rabbinic literature ) <Ul> <Li> Mishnah and commentaries </Li> <Li> Tosefta and the minor tractates </Li> <Li> Talmud : <Ul> <Li> The Babylonian Talmud and commentaries </Li> <Li> Jerusalem Talmud and commentaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Midrashic literature : <Ul> <Li> Halakhic Midrash </Li> <Li> Aggadic Midrash </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Halakhic literature <Ul> <Li> Major Codes of Jewish Law and Custom <Ul> <Li> Mishneh Torah and commentaries </Li> <Li> Tur and commentaries </Li> <Li> Shulchan Aruch and commentaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Responsa literature </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Jewish Thought and Ethics <Ul> <Li> Jewish philosophy </Li> <Li> Musar literature and other works of Jewish ethics </Li> <Li> Kabbalah </Li> <Li> Hasidic works </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Siddur and Jewish liturgy </Li> <Li> Piyyut ( Classical Jewish poetry ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Many traditional Jewish texts are available online in various Torah databases ( electronic versions of the Traditional Jewish Bookshelf ) . Many of these have advanced search options available . </P> <H3> Jewish legal literature </H3> Main article : Halakha <P> The basis of Jewish law and tradition ( halakha ) is the Torah ( also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses ) . According to rabbinic tradition , there are 613 commandments in the Torah . Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women , some only to the ancient priestly groups , the Kohanim and Leviyim ( members of the tribe of Levi ) , some only to farmers within the Land of Israel . Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed , and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today . </P> <P> While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone ( e.g. , the Sadducees , and the Karaites ) , most Jews believe in the oral law . These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis . </P> <P> According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition , God gave both the Written Law ( the Torah ) and the Oral law to Moses on Mount Sinai . The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him , transmitted and taught to the sages ( rabbinic leaders ) of each subsequent generation . </P> <P> For centuries , the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition . Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten , Rabbi Judah haNasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the Mishnah . </P> <P> The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law , which are the basis of the Talmud . According to Abraham ben David , the Mishnah was compiled by Rabbi Judah haNasi after the destruction of Jerusalem , in anno mundi 3949 , which corresponds to 189 CE . </P> <P> Over the next four centuries , the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world 's major Jewish communities ( in Israel and Babylonia ) . The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two Talmuds , the Jerusalem Talmud ( Talmud Yerushalmi ) and the Babylonian Talmud ( Talmud Bavli ) . These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages . </P> <P> In the text of the Torah , many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions . Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition , illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other , i.e. , oral , sources . </P> <P> Halakha , the rabbinic Jewish way of life , then , is based on a combined reading of the Torah , and the oral tradition -- the Mishnah , the halakhic Midrash , the Talmud and its commentaries . The Halakha has developed slowly , through a precedent - based system . The literature of questions to rabbis , and their considered answers , is referred to as responsa ( in Hebrew , Sheelot U-Teshuvot . ) Over time , as practices develop , codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa ; the most important code , the Shulchan Aruch , largely determines Orthodox religious practice today . </P> <H3> Jewish philosophy </H3> Main article : Jewish philosophy <P> Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology . Major Jewish philosophers include Solomon ibn Gabirol , Saadia Gaon , Judah Halevi , Maimonides , and Gersonides . Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment ( late 18th to early 19th century ) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers . Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy . Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler , Joseph B. Soloveitchik , and Yitzchok Hutner . Well - known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber , Franz Rosenzweig , Mordecai Kaplan , Abraham Joshua Heschel , Will Herberg , and Emmanuel Lévinas . </P> <H3> Rabbinic hermeneutics </H3> 13 Principles of Hermeneutics : <Ol> <Li> A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form </Li> <Li> A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms . </Li> <Li> A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served . </Li> <Li> When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars , only those particulars are to be embraced by it . </Li> <Li> A law that begins with specifying particular cases , and then proceeds to an all - embracing generalization , is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization . </Li> <Li> A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications , then continues with the specification of particular cases , and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization , can be applied only to the particular cases specified . </Li> <Li> The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars ( rules 4 and 5 ) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language . </Li> <Li> A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization . </Li> <Li> A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited , but without any mention of the penalty . </Li> <Li> A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case , normally included in the generalization , with a modification in the penalty , either toward easing it or making it more severe . </Li> <Li> A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them . </Li> <Li> Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages </Li> <Li> Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages . </Li> </Ol> <P> -- R. Ishmael </P> <P> Orthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents , but of its interpretations as well . The study of Torah ( in its widest sense , to include both poetry , narrative , and law , and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud ) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance . For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud , and for their successors today , the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God 's revelation , but an end in itself . According to the Talmud , </P> <Dl> <Dd> These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come ; they are : honoring parents , loving deeds of kindness , and making peace between one person and another . But the study of the Torah is equal to them all . ( Talmud Shabbat 127a ) . </Dd> </Dl> <P> In Judaism , `` the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God '' . Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism , Professor Jacob Neusner observed : </P> <Dl> <Dd> The rabbi 's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic - chopping . It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world ... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism : the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification . '' </Dd> </Dl> <P> To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study how to study the word of God . </P> <P> In the study of Torah , the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles . According to David Stern , all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms : </P> <Dl> <Dd> first , the belief in the omni - significance of Scripture , in the meaningfulness of its every word , letter , even ( according to one famous report ) scribal flourish ; second , the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will . </Dd> </Dl> <P> These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations . According to the Talmud , </P> <Dl> <Dd> A single verse has several meanings , but no two verses hold the same meaning . It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael : ' Behold , My word is like fire -- declares the Lord -- and like a hammer that shatters rock ' ( Jer 23 : 29 ) . Just as this hammer produces many sparks ( when it strikes the rock ) , so a single verse has several meanings . '' ( Talmud Sanhedrin 34a ) . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic , because it contains within it a host of interpretations </P> <P> According to Rabbinic tradition , all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form , and handed down from teacher to pupil ( The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself ) . When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations , they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments ; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai . </P> <P> Thus , Hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws ( baraita at the beginning of Sifra ) ; R. Ishmael , thirteen ( baraita at the beginning of Sifra ; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel ) . Eliezer b . Jose ha - Gelili listed 32 , largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah . All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet ha - Shachar , the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra . Nevertheless , R. Ishmael 's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known ; they constitute an important , and one of Judaism 's earliest , contributions to logic , hermeneutics , and jurisprudence . Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael 's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century . Today R. Ishmael 's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis . </P> <H2> Jewish identity </H2> <H3> Origin of the term `` Judaism '' </H3> A mezuzah case <P> The term `` Judaism '' derives from Iudaismus , a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek Ioudaismos ( Ἰουδαϊσμός ) ( from the verb ἰουδαΐζειν , `` to side with or imitate the ( Judeans ) '' ) , and it was ultimately inspired by the Hebrew יהודה , Yehudah , `` Judah '' ; in Hebrew : יַהֲדוּת , Yahadut . The term Ἰουδαϊσμός first appears in the Hellenistic Greek book of 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE . In the context of the age and period it meant `` seeking or forming part of a cultural entity '' and it resembled its antonym hellenismos , a word that signified a people 's submission to Hellenic ( Greek ) cultural norms . The conflict between iudaismos and hellenismos lay behind the Maccabean revolt and hence the invention of the term iudaismos . </P> <P> Shaye J.D. Cohen writes in his book The Beginnings of Jewishness : </P> <P> We are tempted , of course , to translate ( Ioudaïsmós ) as `` Judaism , '' but this translation is too narrow , because in this first occurrence of the term , Ioudaïsmós has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion . It means rather `` the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean ( or Jews Jewish ) . '' Among these characteristics , to be sure , are practices and beliefs that we would today call `` religious , '' but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term . Thus Ioudaïsmós should be translated not as `` Judaism '' but as Judaeanness . </P> <P> The earliest instance in Europe where the term was used to mean `` the profession or practice of the Jewish religion ; the religious system or polity of the Jews '' is Robert Fabyan 's The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce a 1513 . `` Judaism '' as a direct translation of the Latin Iudaismus first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the apocrypha ( Deuterocanon in Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy ) , 2 Macc . ii. 21 : `` Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme . '' </P> <H3> Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism </H3> <P> According to Daniel Boyarin , the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself , and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism . Consequently , in his view , Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories , such as religion , ethnicity , or culture . Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism 's more than 3,000 - year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West ( that is , Europe , particularly medieval and modern Europe ) . During this time , Jews experienced slavery , anarchic and theocratic self - government , conquest , occupation , and exile . In the Diaspora , they were in contact with , and influenced by , ancient Egyptian , Babylonian , Persian , and Hellenic cultures , as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment ( see Haskalah ) and the rise of nationalism , which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland , the Land of Israel . They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism ( the Khazars ) , only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols . Thus , Boyarin has argued that `` Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity , because it is not national , not genealogical , not religious , but all of these , in dialectical tension . '' </P> <P> In contrast to this point of view , practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism , while retaining certain cultural traditions . </P> <H3> Who is a Jew ? </H3> Main article : Who is a Jew ? <P> According to Rabbinic Judaism , a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who converted to Judaism in accordance with Jewish Law . Reconstructionist Judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide Progressive Judaism ( also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism ) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish , if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity , but not the smaller regional branches . All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts , although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud . The conversion process is evaluated by an authority , and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge . Converts are called `` ben Abraham '' or `` bat Abraham '' , ( son or daughter of Abraham ) . Conversions have on occasion been overturned . In 2008 , Israel 's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews , mostly from Russian immigrant families , even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi . </P> <P> Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew , whether by birth or conversion , is a Jew forever . Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish . According to some sources , the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew , and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes . However , the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried , and different situations call for consideration and differing actions . For example , Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism `` without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community '' and `` A proselyte who has become an apostate remains , nevertheless , a Jew '' . </P> <P> Karaite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent . Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish , and not only the father . They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line . </P> <P> The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when , in the 1950s , David Ben - Gurion requested opinions on mihu Yehudi ( `` Who is a Jew '' ) from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions . This is still not settled , and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics . </P> <P> Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent , and halakhic conversions . Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud , around 200 CE . Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh , such as Deuteronomy 7 : 1 -- 5 , by Jewish sages , are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because `` ( the non-Jewish husband ) will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods ( i.e. , idols ) of others . '' Leviticus 24 : 10 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is `` of the community of Israel . '' This is complemented by Ezra 10 : 2 -- 3 , where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children . A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line , although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period . Since the anti-religious Haskalah movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries , halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged . </P> <H3> Jewish Demographics </H3> Main article : Jewish population by country <P> The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of `` who is a Jew '' is problematic ; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish , and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews . According to the Jewish Year Book ( 1901 ) , the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million . The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar ( 2005 ) . In 2002 , according to the Jewish Population Survey , there were 13.3 million Jews around the world . The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million . Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent , with 0.3 % growth from 2000 to 2001 . </P> <H2> Jewish religious movements </H2> Main article : Jewish religious movements <H3> Rabbinic Judaism </H3> <P> Rabbinic Judaism ( or in some Christian traditions , Rabbinism ) ( Hebrew : `` Yahadut Rabanit '' -- יהדות רבנית ) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE , after the codification of the Talmud . It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah ( Written Law ) can not be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the Law . </P> <P> The Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Ashkenazi ( Western ) Jewry into religious movements or denominations , especially in North America and Anglophone countries . The main denominations today outside Israel ( where the situation is rather different ) are Orthodox , Conservative , and Reform . </P> <Ul> <Li> Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging . Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch ( a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions ) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law . Orthodoxy places a high importance on Maimonides ' 13 principles as a definition of Jewish faith . </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Orthodoxy is often divided into Modern Orthodox Judaism and Haredi Judaism . Haredi Judaism is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines , and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices . Subsets of Haredi Judaism include Hasidic Judaism , which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher ; and Sephardic Haredi Judaism , which emerged among Sephardic ( Asian and North African ) Jews in Israel . </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Conservative Judaism is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs , including observance of Shabbat and kashrut , a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith , a positive attitude toward modern culture , and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts . Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static , but has always developed in response to changing conditions . It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will , but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses . Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative , but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions . </Li> <Li> Reform Judaism , called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries , defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms , rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws , and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets . Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular ( along with Hebrew in many cases ) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition . </Li> </Ul> A Reform synagogue with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women <Ul> <Li> Reconstructionist Judaism , like Reform Judaism , does not hold that Jewish law , as such , requires observance , but unlike Reform , Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow . </Li> <Li> Jewish Renewal is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law . Men and women participate equally in prayer . </Li> <Li> Humanistic Judaism is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity . </Li> </Ul> Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism <P> While traditions and customs ( see also `` Sephardic law and customs '' ) vary between discrete communities , it can be said that Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the `` movement '' framework popular in and among Ashkenazi Jewry . Historically , Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a `` big tent '' approach . This is particularly the case in contemporary Israel , which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world . ( However , individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi - inflected movement or another . ) </P> <P> Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative , and prayer rites are reflective of this , with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception . Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought ; for example , the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel . </P> Jewish movements in Israel Main article : Religion in Israel <P> Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as `` secular '' ( hiloni ) , `` traditional '' ( masorti ) , `` religious '' ( dati ) or Haredi . The term `` secular '' is more popular as a self - description among Israeli families of western ( European ) origin , whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives , but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice . This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life , be it of the official Israeli rabbinate ( Orthodox ) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism ( Reform , Conservative ) . </P> <P> The term `` traditional '' ( masorti ) is most common as a self - description among Israeli families of `` eastern '' origin ( i.e. , the Middle East , Central Asia , and North Africa ) . This term , as commonly used , has nothing to do with the Conservative Judaism , which also names itself `` Masorti '' outside North America . There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways `` secular '' and `` traditional '' are used in Israel : they often overlap , and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance . The term `` Orthodox '' is not popular in Israeli discourse , although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora . What would be called `` Orthodox '' in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati ( religious ) or haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) in Israel . The former term includes what is called `` Religious Zionism '' or the `` National Religious '' community , as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as haredi - leumi ( nationalist haredi ) , or `` Hardal '' , which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology . ( Some people , in Yiddish , also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as frum , as opposed to frei ( more liberal Jews ) ) . </P> <P> Haredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines : ( 1 ) `` Lithuanian '' ( non-hasidic ) haredim of Ashkenazic origin ; ( 2 ) Hasidic haredim of Ashkenazic origin ; and ( 3 ) Sephardic haredim . </P> <H3> Karaites and Samaritans </H3> <P> Karaite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period , such as the Sadducees . The Karaites ( `` Scripturalists '' ) accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat ( `` simple '' meaning ) ; they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative . Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all , although most do . </P> <P> The Samaritans , a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus / Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon , near Tel Aviv in Israel , regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel . Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah ( Five Books of Moses ) , which they view as the only authoritative scripture ( with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua ) . </P> <H3> Haymanot ( Ethiopian Judaism ) </H3> <P> See also : Haymanot ; Beta Israel . </P> <P> Haymanot ( meaning `` religion '' in Ge'ez and Amharic ) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews . This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic , Karaite , and Samaritan Judaisms , Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier . Sacred scriptures ( the Orit ) are written in Ge'ez , not Hebrew , and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit , without explication from ancillary commentaries . Holidays also differ , with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities , and some additional holidays , like Sigd . </P> <H2> Jewish observances </H2> <H3> Jewish ethics </H3> Main article : Jewish ethics <P> Jewish ethics may be guided by halakhic traditions , by other moral principles , or by central Jewish virtues . Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice , truth , peace , loving - kindness ( chesed ) , compassion , humility , and self - respect . Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity ( tzedakah ) and refraining from negative speech ( lashon hara ) . Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews . </P> <H3> Prayers </H3> Main article : Jewish services A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers , wearing a kippah skullcap , prayer shawl and tefillin <P> Traditionally , Jews recite prayers three times daily , Shacharit , Mincha , and Ma'ariv with a fourth prayer , Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays . At the heart of each service is the Amidah or Shemoneh Esrei . Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith , the Shema Yisrael ( or Shema ) . The Shema is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ( Deuteronomy 6 : 4 ) : Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad -- `` Hear , O Israel ! The Lord is our God ! The Lord is One ! '' </P> <P> Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer , although communal prayer is preferred . Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews , called a minyan . In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles , only male Jews are counted toward a minyan ; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well . </P> <P> In addition to prayer services , observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts . Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning , before eating or drinking different foods , after eating a meal , and so on . </P> <P> The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations . Differences can include the texts of prayers , the frequency of prayer , the number of prayers recited at various religious events , the use of musical instruments and choral music , and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular . In general , Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition , and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services . Also , in most Conservative synagogues , and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations , women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men , including roles traditionally filled only by men , such as reading from the Torah . In addition , many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs . </P> <H3> Religious clothing </H3> Further information : kippah , tzitzit , and tefillin <P> A kippah ( Hebrew : כִּפָּה , plural kippot ; Yiddish : יאַרמלקע , yarmulke ) is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying , eating , reciting blessings , or studying Jewish religious texts , and at all times by some Jewish men . In Orthodox communities , only men wear kippot ; in non-Orthodox communities , some women also wear kippot . Kippot range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large , snug cap that covers the whole crown . </P> <P> Tzitzit ( Hebrew : צִיציִת ) ( Ashkenazi pronunciation : tzitzis ) are special knotted `` fringes '' or `` tassels '' found on the four corners of the tallit ( Hebrew : טַלִּית ) ( Ashkenazi pronunciation : tallis ) , or prayer shawl . The tallit is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service . Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit . In the Sephardi community , boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age . In some Ashkenazi communities , it is customary to wear one only after marriage . A tallit katan ( small tallit ) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day . In some Orthodox circles , the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing . </P> <P> Tefillin ( Hebrew : תְפִלִּין ) , known in English as phylacteries ( from the Greek word φυλακτήριον , meaning safeguard or amulet ) , are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses , attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps . They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women . </P> <P> A kittel ( Yiddish : קיטל ) , a white knee - length overgarment , is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays . It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities , and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy . Jewish males are buried in a tallit and sometimes also a kittel which are part of the tachrichim ( burial garments ) . </P> <H3> Jewish holidays </H3> Main article : Jewish holiday <P> Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar , which celebrate moments in Jewish history , as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world , such as creation , revelation , and redemption . </P> Shabbat Main article : Shabbat Two braided Shabbat challahs placed under an embroidered challah cover at the start of the Shabbat meal <P> Shabbat , the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night , commemorates God 's day of rest after six days of creation . It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law . At sundown on Friday , the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing . The evening meal begins with the Kiddush , a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine , and the Mohtzi , a blessing recited over the bread . It is customary to have challah , two braided loaves of bread , on the table . During Shabbat , Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of melakhah , translated literally as `` work '' . In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not `` work '' in the usual sense : They include such actions as lighting a fire , writing , using money and carrying in the public domain . The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car , which involves burning fuel and using electricity . </P> Three pilgrimage festivals Main article : Shalosh regalim Some sukkot in Jerusalem <P> Jewish holy days ( chaggim ) , celebrate landmark events in Jewish history , such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah , and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle . The three major festivals , Sukkot , Passover and Shavuot , are called `` regalim '' ( derived from the Hebrew word `` regel '' , or foot ) . On the three regalim , it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple . </P> <Ul> <Li> Passover ( Pesach ) is a week - long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of Nisan ( the first month in the Hebrew calendar ) , that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt . Outside Israel , Passover is celebrated for eight days . In ancient times , it coincided with the barley harvest . It is the only holiday that centers on home - service , the Seder . Leavened products ( chametz ) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week . Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by - products remain , and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder . Matzo is eaten instead of bread . </Li> <Li> Shavuot ( `` Pentecost '' or `` Feast of Weeks '' ) celebrates the revelation of the Torah to the Israelites on Mount Sinai . Also known as the Festival of Bikurim , or first fruits , it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest . Shavuot customs include all - night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot , eating dairy foods ( cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites ) , reading the Book of Ruth , decorating homes and synagogues with greenery , and wearing white clothing , symbolizing purity . </Li> <Li> Sukkot ( `` Tabernacles '' or `` The Festival of Booths '' ) commemorates the Israelites ' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land . It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called sukkot ( sing . sukkah ) that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering . It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle . Jews around the world eat in sukkot for seven days and nights . Sukkot concludes with Shemini Atzeret , where Jews begin to pray for rain and Simchat Torah , `` Rejoicing of the Torah '' , a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again . The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls . Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot . </Li> </Ul> High holy days Yom Kippur by Maurycy Gottlieb ( 1878 ) Main article : High Holidays <P> The High Holidays ( Yamim Noraim or `` Days of Awe '' ) revolve around judgment and forgiveness . </P> <Ul> <Li> Rosh Hashanah , ( also Yom Ha - Zikkaron or `` Day of Remembrance '' , and Yom Teruah , or `` Day of the Sounding of the Shofar '' ) . Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year ( literally , `` head of the year '' ) , although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar , Tishri . Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10 - day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur , during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed , intentionally or not , throughout the year . Holiday customs include blowing the shofar , or ram 's horn , in the synagogue , eating apples and honey , and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods , such as pomegranates . </Li> <Li> Yom Kippur , ( `` Day of Atonement '' ) is the holiest day of the Jewish year . It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one 's sins . Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue , sometimes with a short break in the afternoon , reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a `` Machzor '' . Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur . On the eve of Yom Kippur , before candles are lit , a prefast meal , the `` seuda mafseket '' , is eaten . Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer . It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur , especially for Kol Nidre , and leather shoes are not worn . The following day , prayers are held from morning to evening . The final prayer service , called `` Ne'ilah '' , ends with a long blast of the shofar . </Li> </Ul> Pûrîm Main article : Purim Purim street scene in Jerusalem Torah reading , France , 1860 Museum of Jewish Art and History <P> Purim ( Hebrew : פורים ( help info ) Pûrîm `` lots '' ) is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman , who sought to exterminate them , as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther . It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther , mutual gifts of food and drink , charity to the poor , and a celebratory meal ( Esther 9 : 22 ) . Other customs include drinking wine , eating special pastries called hamantashen , dressing up in masks and costumes , and organizing carnivals and parties . </P> <P> Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar , which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar . </P> Hanukkah Main article : Hanukkah <P> Hanukkah ( Hebrew : חֲנֻכָּה  , `` dedication '' ) also known as the Festival of Lights , is an eight - day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev ( Hebrew calendar ) . The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival 's eight nights , one on the first night , two on the second night and so on . </P> <P> The holiday was called Hanukkah ( meaning `` dedication '' ) because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes . Spiritually , Hanukkah commemorates the `` Miracle of the Oil '' . According to the Talmud , at the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire , there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day . Miraculously , the oil burned for eight days -- which was the length of time it took to press , prepare and consecrate new oil . </P> <P> Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism , but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times , mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel . </P> Fast days Main articles : Tisha B'Av , Seventeenth of Tamuz , 10th of Tevet , and Tzom Gedaliah <P> Tisha B'Av ( Hebrew : תשעה באב  or ט ׳ באב , `` the Ninth of Av '' ) is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples , and in later times , the expulsion of the Jews from Spain . </P> <P> There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples . They are the 17th Tamuz , the 10th of Tevet and Tzom Gedaliah ( the 3rd of Tishrei ) . </P> Israeli holidays Main articles : Yom Hashoah , Yom Hazikaron , and Yom Ha'atzmaut <P> The modern holidays of Yom Ha - shoah ( Holocaust Remembrance Day ) , Yom Hazikaron ( Israeli Memorial Day ) and Yom Ha'atzmaut ( Israeli Independence Day ) commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust , the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism , and Israeli independence , respectively . </P> <P> There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the 10th of Tevet . </P> <H3> Torah readings </H3> Main article : Torah reading <P> The core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah , along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh , called Haftarah . Over the course of a year , the whole Torah is read , with the cycle starting over in the autumn , on Simchat Torah . </P> <H3> Synagogues and religious buildings </H3> Main article : Synagogue Interior of the Belz Great Synagogue in Jerusalem . <P> Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study . They usually contain separate rooms for prayer ( the main sanctuary ) , smaller rooms for study , and often an area for community or educational use . There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly . The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples . Some traditional features of a synagogue are : </P> <Ul> <Li> The ark ( called aron ha - kodesh by Ashkenazim and hekhal by Sephardim ) where the Torah scrolls are kept ( the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain ( parochet ) outside or inside the ark doors ) ; </Li> <Li> The elevated reader 's platform ( called bimah by Ashkenazim and tebah by Sephardim ) , where the Torah is read ( and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues ) ; </Li> <Li> The eternal light ( ner tamid ) , a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem </Li> <Li> The pulpit , or amud , a lectern facing the Ark where the hazzan or prayer leader stands while praying . </Li> </Ul> <P> In addition to synagogues , other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas , or institutions of Jewish learning , and mikvahs , which are ritual baths . </P> <H3> Dietary laws : kashrut </H3> Main article : Kashrut <P> The Jewish dietary laws are known as kashrut . Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher , and food that is not kosher is also known as treifah or treif . People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be `` keeping kosher '' . </P> <P> Many of the laws apply to animal - based foods . For example , in order to be considered kosher , mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud . The pig is arguably the most well - known example of a non-kosher animal . Although it has split hooves , it does not chew its cud . For seafood to be kosher , the animal must have fins and scales . Certain types of seafood , such as shellfish , crustaceans , and eels , are therefore considered non-kosher . Concerning birds , a list of non-kosher species is given in the Torah . The exact translations of many of the species have not survived , and some non-kosher birds ' identities are no longer certain . However , traditions exist about the kashrut status of a few birds . For example , both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities . Other types of animals , such as amphibians , reptiles , and most insects , are prohibited altogether . </P> <P> In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher , meat and poultry ( but not fish ) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as shechitah . Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered treif . The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal . Forbidden parts of animals include the blood , some fats , and the area in and around the sciatic nerve . </P> <P> Jewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together . The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community , and can extend for up to six hours . Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother 's milk , this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah , the Talmud and Rabbinic law . Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of kashrut , but the prohibition is Rabbinic , not Biblical . </P> <P> The use of dishes , serving utensils , and ovens may make food treif that would otherwise be kosher . Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food , or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products , render the food treif under certain conditions . </P> <P> Furthermore , all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non-Jews , due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals . Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision . </P> <P> The Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of kashrut . However , a number of explanations have been offered , including maintaining ritual purity , teaching impulse control , encouraging obedience to God , improving health , reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community . The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons , and some may exist for multiple reasons . For example , people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because , according to the Torah , this is where animal souls are contained . In contrast , the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because `` they are unclean '' . The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods , but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating . </P> <P> Survival concerns supersede all the laws of kashrut , as they do for most halakhot . </P> <H3> Laws of ritual purity </H3> Main article : Tumah A silver matchbox holder for ritual use on Shabbat with inscription in Hebrew <P> The Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is tahor or ritually pure may become tamei or ritually impure . Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves , seminal flux , vaginal flux , menstruation , and contact with people who have become impure from any of these . In Rabbinic Judaism , Kohanim , members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple , are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies . During the Temple period , such priests ( Kohanim ) were required to eat their bread offering ( Terumah ) in a state of ritual purity , which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted , such as hand - washing which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread . </P> Family purity 18th - century circumcision chair Museum of Jewish Art and History Main article : Niddah <P> An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women . These laws are also known as niddah , literally `` separation '' , or family purity . Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews , they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations . </P> <P> Especially in Orthodox Judaism , the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions . For example , the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days . A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped . The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period , known in the Torah as zavah , and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends . In addition , Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period . Afterwards , purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh . </P> <P> Traditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and , similar to Karaite practice , do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple 's special sanctity . Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices . </P> <H3> Life - cycle events </H3> <P> Life - cycle events , or rites of passage , occur throughout a Jew 's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him / her to the entire community . </P> <Ul> <Li> Brit milah -- Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of circumcision on their eighth day of life . The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony . A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls , named zeved habat or brit bat , enjoys limited popularity . </Li> <Li> Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah -- This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations . In the Reform movement , both girls and boys have their bat / bar mitzvah at age thirteen . This is often commemorated by having the new adults , male only in the Orthodox tradition , lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a `` portion '' of the Torah . </Li> <Li> Marriage -- Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event . A wedding takes place under a chuppah , or wedding canopy , which symbolizes a happy house . At the end of the ceremony , the groom breaks a glass with his foot , symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple , and the scattering of the Jewish people . </Li> <Li> Death and Mourning -- Judaism has a multi-staged mourning practice . The first stage is called the shiva ( literally `` seven '' , observed for one week ) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family , the second is the shloshim ( observed for one month ) and for those who have lost one of their parents , there is a third stage , avelut yud bet chodesh , which is observed for eleven months . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Community leadership </H2> <H3> Classical priesthood </H3> Jewish students with their teacher in Samarkand , Uzbekistan c. 1910 . <P> The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices . The priesthood is an inherited position , and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties , they are still honored in many Jewish communities . Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty . </P> <Ul> <Li> Kohen ( priest ) -- patrilineal descendant of Aaron , brother of Moses . In the Temple , the kohanim were charged with performing the sacrifices . Today , a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah , performs the Priestly Blessing , as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies , including the ceremony of redemption of the first - born . </Li> <Li> Levi ( Levite ) -- Patrilineal descendant of Levi the son of Jacob . In the Temple in Jerusalem , the levites sang Psalms , performed construction , maintenance , janitorial , and guard duties , assisted the priests , and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public . Today , a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Prayer leaders </H3> <P> From the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present , Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies . A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself . Some activities -- reading the Torah and haftarah ( a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings ) , the prayer for mourners , the blessings for bridegroom and bride , the complete grace after meals -- require a minyan , the presence of ten Jews . </P> <P> The most common professional clergy in a synagogue are : </P> <Ul> <Li> Rabbi of a congregation -- Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation . This role requires ordination by the congregation 's preferred authority ( i.e. , from a respected Orthodox rabbi or , if the congregation is Conservative or Reform , from academic seminaries ) . A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi . Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as shatz or baal kriyah ( see below ) . <Ul> <Li> Hassidic Rebbe -- rabbi who is the head of a Hasidic dynasty . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Hazzan ( note : the `` h '' denotes voiceless pharyngeal fricative ) ( cantor ) -- a trained vocalist who acts as shatz . Chosen for a good voice , knowledge of traditional tunes , understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them . A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan . </Li> </Ul> <P> Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles , which are sometimes , but not always , filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations . In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad - hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis : </P> <Ul> <Li> Shaliach tzibur or Shatz ( leader -- literally `` agent '' or `` representative '' -- of the congregation ) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community . When a shatz recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation , he is not acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator . The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying amen at their conclusion ; it is with this act that the shatz 's prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation . Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as shatz . In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations , only men can be prayer leaders , but all Progressive communities now allow women to serve in this function . </Li> <Li> The Baal kriyah or baal koreh ( master of the reading ) reads the weekly Torah portion . The requirements for being the baal kriyah are the same as those for the shatz . These roles are not mutually exclusive . The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does . Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services ( or parts of services ) will be led by each . </Li> </Ul> <P> Many congregations , especially larger ones , also rely on a : </P> <Ul> <Li> Gabbai ( sexton ) -- Calls people up to the Torah , appoints the shatz for each prayer session if there is no standard shatz , and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied . </Li> </Ul> <P> The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor . Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as shatz and baal kriyah , and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations . However , in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad - hoc basis . Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis , the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations , and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still . </P> <H3> Specialized religious roles </H3> <Ul> <Li> Dayan ( judge ) -- An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a beth din ( rabbinical court ) . In Israel , religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases , conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community . </Li> <Li> Mohel ( circumciser ) -- An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified mohel and performs the brit milah ( circumcision ) . </Li> <Li> Shochet ( ritual slaughterer ) -- In order for meat to be kosher , it must be slaughtered by a shochet who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another shochet . </Li> <Li> Sofer ( scribe ) -- Torah scrolls , tefillin ( phylacteries ) , mezuzot ( scrolls put on doorposts ) , and gittin ( bills of divorce ) must be written by a sofer who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts . </Li> <Li> Rosh yeshiva -- A Torah scholar who runs a yeshiva . </Li> <Li> Mashgiach of a yeshiva -- Depending on which yeshiva , might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct , or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on mussar ( Jewish ethics ) . </Li> <Li> Mashgiach -- Supervises manufacturers of kosher food , importers , caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher . Must be an expert in the laws of kashrut and trained by a rabbi , if not a rabbi himself . </Li> </Ul> <H2> History </H2> Main article : Jewish history This section is about the history of Judaism . For the book on Ancient Judaism , see Ancient Judaism ( book ) . <H3> Origins </H3> Main article : Origins of Judaism Further information : Ancient Canaanite religion and Ancient Semitic religion Scenes from the Book of Esther decorate the Dura - Europos synagogue dating from 244 CE <P> At its core , the Tanakh is an account of the Israelites ' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple ( c. 535 BCE ) . Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people . As a reward for his act of faith in one God , he was promised that Isaac , his second son , would inherit the Land of Israel ( then called Canaan ) . Later , the descendants of Isaac 's son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt , and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt . At Mount Sinai , they received the Torah -- the five books of Moses . These books , together with Nevi'im and Ketuvim are known as Torah Shebikhtav as opposed to the Oral Torah , which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud . Eventually , God led them to the land of Israel where the tabernacle was planted in the city of Shiloh for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies . As time went on , the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the Philistines to capture the tabernacle . The people of Israel then told Samuel the prophet that they needed to be governed by a permanent king , and Samuel appointed Saul to be their King . When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel , God told Samuel to appoint David in his stead . </P> The Western Wall in Jerusalem is a remnant of the wall encircling the Second Temple . The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism . <P> Once King David was established , he told the prophet Nathan that he would like to build a permanent temple , and as a reward for his actions , God promised David that he would allow his son , Solomon , to build the First Temple and the throne would never depart from his children . </P> <P> Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law , which are called the Oral Torah or oral law , were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai . However , as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten , these oral laws were recorded by Rabbi Judah HaNasi ( Judah the Prince ) in the Mishnah , redacted circa 200 CE . The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara , rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries . The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship , Palestine and Babylonia . Correspondingly , two bodies of analysis developed , and two works of Talmud were created . The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud . It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine . The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars Ravina I , Ravina II , and Rav Ashi by 500 CE , although it continued to be edited later . </P> <P> Some critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts , including the Hebrew Bible , were divinely inspired . Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts . Many suggest that during the First Temple period , the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god , but that their god was superior to other gods . Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile , perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism . In this view , it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed . </P> <P> John Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh , El , Asherah , and Ba'al , may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion , which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the Greek pantheon . </P> <H3> Antiquity </H3> Main articles : Ancient Israel and Judah , Babylonian captivity , Hellenistic Judaism , Hasmonean Kingdom , Iudaea Province , and Bar Kokhba revolt <P> According to the Hebrew Bible , the United Monarchy was established under Saul and continued under King David and Solomon with its capital in Jerusalem . After Solomon 's reign , the nation split into two kingdoms , the Kingdom of Israel ( in the north ) and the Kingdom of Judah ( in the south ) . The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrian ruler Sargon II in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the Khabur River valley . The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE , destroying the First Temple that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship . The Judean elite was exiled to Babylonia and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora . Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the Persians seventy years later , a period known as the Babylonian Captivity . A new Second Temple was constructed , and old religious practices were resumed . </P> <P> During the early years of the Second Temple , the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly , led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra . Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly , the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed . </P> <P> Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE . After the Great Revolt ( 66 -- 73 CE ) , the Romans destroyed the Temple . Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision ; these acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba revolt 132 -- 136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays , and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea . In 200 CE , however , Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a religio licita ( `` legitimate religion '' ) until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in the fourth century . </P> <P> Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews , Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple , prayer took the place of sacrifice , and worship was rebuilt around the community ( represented by a minimum of ten adult men ) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities ( see Jewish diaspora ) . </P> <H3> Historical Jewish groupings ( to 1700 ) </H3> The Torah Ark of the Beth Jakov synagogue in Macedonia <P> Around the 1st century CE , there were several small Jewish sects : the Pharisees , Sadducees , Zealots , Essenes , and Christians . After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE , these sects vanished . Christianity survived , but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion ; the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism ( today , known simply as `` Judaism '' ) . The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings , relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired . Consequently , a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees ' belief system ( which became the basis for modern Judaism ) , were also dismissed by the Sadducees . ( The Samaritans practiced a similar religion , which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism . ) </P> <P> Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah , some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah ( and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds ) , relying instead only upon the Tanakh . These included the Isunians , the Yudganites , the Malikites , and others . They soon developed oral traditions of their own , which differed from the rabbinic traditions , and eventually formed the Karaite sect . Karaites exist in small numbers today , mostly living in Israel . Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews , but that the other faith is erroneous . </P> <P> Over a long time , Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas -- amongst others , the Ashkenazi Jews ( of central and Eastern Europe ) , the Sephardi Jews ( of Spain , Portugal , and North Africa ) , the Beta Israel of Ethiopia , and the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula . Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers , traditions and accepted canons ; however , these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative ( rabbinic ) Judaism , rather than based on any doctrinal dispute . </P> <H3> Persecutions </H3> Main articles : Persecution of Jews , Antisemitism , and History of antisemitism <P> Antisemitism arose during the Middle Ages , in the form of persecutions , pogroms , forced conversions , expulsions , social restrictions and ghettoization . </P> <P> This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times . Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups . With the rise of the Churches , the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism . During the Middle Ages , Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration , but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad 's persecutions . </P> <H3> Hasidism </H3> Main article : Hasidic Judaism <P> Hasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer ( 1700 -- 1760 ) , also known as the Ba'al Shem Tov ( or Besht ) . It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study ; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too `` academic '' , and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy . Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel , which , in contrast to a traditional synagogue , could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing , eating , and socializing . Ba'al Shem Tov 's disciples attracted many followers ; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe . Unlike other religions , which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print , Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks , who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement . Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn , did not require full immediate commitment , and presented a compelling spectacle . Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe . Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States . The movement itself claims to be nothing new , but a refreshment of original Judaism . As some have put it : `` they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost '' . Nevertheless , early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews . European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim , ( lit . `` opponents '' ) . Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship , its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders , and the concern that it might become a messianic sect . Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism . </P> <H3> The Enlightenment and new religious movements </H3> Main articles : Haskalah and Jewish religious movements <P> In the late 18th century CE , Europe was swept by a group of intellectual , social and political movements known as the Enlightenment . The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world , thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience . A parallel Jewish movement , Haskalah or the `` Jewish Enlightenment '' , began , especially in Central Europe and Western Europe , in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms . It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason . With the promise of political emancipation , many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe . Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend . </P> <P> In Central Europe , followed by Great Britain and the United States , Reform ( or Liberal ) Judaism developed , relaxing legal obligations ( especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews ) , emulating Protestant decorum in prayer , and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism 's Prophetic tradition . Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism , by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law . Meanwhile , in the United States , wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars , who were Orthodox in practice but critical ( and skeptical ) in their study of the Bible and Talmud , to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe . These left - wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right - wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned , to form the Conservative movement . Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism . After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel , these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries . </P> <H3> Spectrum of observance </H3> Judaism is practised in all parts of the world , for example in a synagogue in downtown Mumbai . <P> Countries such as the United States , Israel , Canada , United Kingdom , Argentina and South Africa contain large Jewish populations . Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance . According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey , in the United States ' Jewish community -- the world 's second largest -- 4.3 million Jews out of 5.1 million had some sort of connection to the religion . Of that population of connected Jews , 80 % participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance , but only 48 % belonged to a congregation , and fewer than 16 % attend regularly . </P> <P> Birth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7 . ( Replacement rate is 2.1 . ) Intermarriage rates range from 40 -- 50 % in the US , and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews . Due to intermarriage and low birth rates , the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5 million in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2001 . This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the Diaspora , but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities , such as Haredi Judaism . The Baal teshuva movement is a movement of Jews who have `` returned '' to religion or become more observant . </P> <H2> Judaism and other religions </H2> <H3> Christianity and Judaism </H3> Main article : Christianity and Judaism See also : Christianity and antisemitism and Christian -- Jewish reconciliation <P> Christianity was originally a sect of Second Temple Judaism , but the two religions diverged in the first century . The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable . Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah , of atonement and sin , the status of God 's commandments to Israel , and perhaps most significantly of the nature of God himself . Due to these differences , Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as Shituf or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic . Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church , though a Christian belief in dual - covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi Holocaust . </P> <P> Since the time of the Middle Ages , the Catholic Church upheld the Constitution pro Judæis ( Formal Statement on the Jews ) , which stated </P> <P> We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized , so long as they are unwilling and refuse ... Without the judgment of the political authority of the land , no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live . '' </P> <P> Until their emancipation in the late 18th and the 19th century , Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations . They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge , restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns ( ghettos ) , and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades ( for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden ) . Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews , exclusion from public life , restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies , and linguistic censorship . Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews , for example , England in 1290 ( Jews were readmitted in 1655 ) and Spain in 1492 ( readmitted in 1868 ) . The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654 ; they were forbidden to hold public office , open a retail shop , or establish a synagogue . When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged , but by 1671 Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America . In 1791 , Revolutionary France was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether , followed by Prussia in 1848 . Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30 - year struggle championed by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the Jews Relief Act 1858 . The newly united German Empire in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany , which were reinstated in the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 . </P> <P> Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent blood libels , expulsions , forced conversions and massacres . An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious . Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries . The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence , and murder culminating in the Holocaust . These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching , art and popular teaching for two millennia , containing contempt for Jews , as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews . The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches ; many of them , such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church , as well as Quakers and Jehovah 's Witnesses , aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime . </P> <P> The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism , have been changed mostly positive since World War II . Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have `` upheld the Church 's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people '' as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews . In December 2015 , the Vatican released a 10,000 - word document that , among other things , stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism . </P> <H3> Islam and Judaism </H3> Main article : Islam and Judaism <P> Both Judaism and Islam arose from the patriarch Abraham , and they are therefore considered Abrahamic religions . In both Jewish and Muslim tradition , the Jewish and Arab peoples are descended from the two sons of Abraham -- Isaac and Ishmael , respectively . While both religions are monotheistic and share many commonalities , they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider Jesus or Muhammad to be prophets . The religions ' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian peninsula . Indeed , the years 712 to 1066 CE under the Ummayad and the Abbasid rulers have been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain . Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries , including Jews , were known as dhimmis . Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs , but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims . For example , they had to pay the jizya , a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males , and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims . Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic . For example , dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing , a practice not found in either the Qur'an or the hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced . Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution -- for example , many were killed , exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century , in Persia , and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al - Andalus , as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century ( see : Mawza Exile ) . At times , Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence -- in Morocco , for example , Jews were confined to walled quarters ( mellahs ) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century . </P> <P> In the mid-20th century , Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries . Most have chosen to live in Israel . Today , antisemitic themes including Holocaust denial have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas , in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran , and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi . </P> <H3> Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism </H3> <P> There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions . The most well - known of these is Messianic Judaism , a religious movement , which arose in the 1960s , that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity . The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah , that he is one of the Three Divine Persons , and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one 's savior . Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism . Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this , stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect , because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity . </P> <P> Other examples of syncretism include Semitic neopaganism , a loosely organized sect which incorporates pagan or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices ; Jewish Buddhists , another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith ; and some Renewal Jews who borrow freely and openly from Buddhism , Sufism , Native American religions , and other faiths . </P> <P> The Kabbalah Centre , which employs teachers from multiple religions , is a New Age movement that claims to popularize the kabbalah , part of the Jewish esoteric tradition . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Judaism portal </Li> <Li> Religion portal </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Book : Abrahamic religions </Li> <Li> Book : Judaism </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Anti-Judaism </Li> <Li> Criticism of Judaism </Li> <Li> Frankism </Li> <Li> Jewish assimilation </Li> <Li> Jewish culture </Li> <Li> Jewish views of religious pluralism </Li> <Li> Judaism by country </Li> <Li> List of converts to Judaism </Li> <Li> Outline of Judaism </Li> <Li> Sabbateanism </Li> <Li> Sumer </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The Bible and Interpretation '' . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Oxford Dictionaries -- Dictionary , Thesaurus , & Grammar '' . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Shaye J.D.

Paul was motivated by a Hellenistic desire for the One , which among other things produced an ideal of a universal human essence , beyond difference and hierarchy . This universal humanity , however , was predicated ( and still is ) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit , such that while the body is particular , marked through practice as Jew or Greek , and through anatomy as male or female , the spirit is universal . Paul did not , however , reject the body -- as did , for instance , the gnostics -- but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place , albeit subordinated to the spirit . Paul 's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well . Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component , so also is language itself . It is composed of outer , material signs and inner , spiritual significations . When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited , the physical , fleshy signs of the Torah , of historical Judaism , are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Boyarin , Daniel ( 1994 ) . `` Answering the Mail '' .

One of these was the Confessing Church , a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934 , the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany . One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law `` which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent . '' Another was to help those `` who suffered through repressive laws , or violence . '' About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church . Much of their work has one unrecognized , but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife . Sheltered in sixty - six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church , they owe them their lives . German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry . More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster . He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time ... Members of the Society of Friends -- German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries -- were particularly successful in rescuing Jews ... Jehovah 's Witnesses , themselves targeted for concentration camps , also provided help to Jews . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Wigoder , Geoffrey ( 1988 ) .

When the term resurfaced in Israel in the 1940s and 1950s , it designated all Jews who accepted Christianity in its Protestant evangelical form . Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews , the term nozrim , `` Christians '' in Hebrew , meant , almost automatically , an alien , hostile religion . Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion , missionaries sought a more neutral term , one that did not arouse negative feelings . They chose Meshichyim , Messianic , to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term nozrim . Meshichyim as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated . It conveyed the sense of a new , innovative religion rather that ( sic ) an old , unfavorable one . The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior , and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians . The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cohn - Sherbok , Dan ( 2000 ) . `` Messianic Jewish mission '' .

Messianic Judaism , although it advocated the idea of an independent movement of Jewish converts , remained the offspring of the missionary movement , and the ties would never be broken . The rise of Messianic Judaism was , in many ways , a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions . The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians . The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer . Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom . Similarly , the missions ' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah . Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism , it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth . The ideology , rhetoric , and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` What are the Standards of the UMJC ?

To convert to the Jewish sect of HaDerech , accepting Yeshua as your King is the first act after one 's heart turns toward HaShem and His Torah -- as one can not obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God , and we love God by following his Messiah . Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him , then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community . It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come ... Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem , and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King , is nothing but a surgical procedure , or worse , could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come -- at which point , what good is Messiah Yeshua , the Word of HaShem to you ? He would have died for nothing ! ... As a convert from the nations , part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant , if you are a male , is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision . Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member ( that is , being made righteous before HaShem , and thus obtaining eternal life ) , but it is a requirement of obedience to God 's commandments , because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham , whether born into the family , adopted , or converted ... If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is , and that is an act of obedience , rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life , then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death , the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him , then pursue circumcision , and thus conversion into Judaism , as an act of obedience to the Messiah . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ * `` Jewish Conversion -- Giyur '' .

Football is a widespread passion among the people of Spain . Football is the sport with the most registered players ( a total of 942,674 of which 898,551 are men and 44,123 women ) , and most registered clubs ( a total of 20,588 ) among all Spanish sport federations according to data issued by the sports administration of Spain 's government in 2016 . </P> <P> In a survey of sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010 , football was the second most popular recreational sport practised by the population ( 17.9 % ) . A total of 75.9 % of people said they had ever bought tickets to attend a football match . In addition , a total of 67.3 % of the people said that they saw all , almost all , many , or some of the football matches broadcast on television . In another survey made in 2014 , the practice of football decreased to 14 % of the population , being overtaken by other sports , such as running , cycling and swimming for recreation . However , in this survey football was still the sport that interests the majority of Spain 's people ( 48 % ) . A total of 67 % of the population said they were fans or had sympathy for a particular club . In addition , 74.9 % said they watched , whenever possible , the matches broadcast on television regarding their favorite teams ; and 42.4 % had , flags , badges or objects of their favorite teams . Data of this survey confirmed the widespread impression that most of Spain 's people are supporters of Real Madrid ( 37.9 % ) or FC Barcelona ( 25.4 % ) , and the other teams have fewer supporters nationwide , as Atlético de Madrid ( 16.1 % ) , Valencia CF ( 3.5 % ) , Athletic Bilbao ( 3.3 . ) or Sevilla FC ( 3.2 % ) . </P> <P> A relationship between football , politics , identity and attitudes towards regionalism in Spain has also been reported . </P> <P> The Royal Spanish Football Federation ( Spanish : Real Federación Española de Fútbol ) is the national governing body , and it organises two Cup competitions ( the Copa del Rey , and the Supercopa de España ) , and the Spain national football team . The Liga de Fútbol Profesional ( LFP ) ( English : Professional Football League ) , integrated by a total of 42 football clubs , forms part of the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) but has autonomy in its organisation and functioning . It is responsible for the organisation of state football leagues , in coordination with RFEF . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team have won the FIFA World Cup once , and has also been successful in the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic tournament . The biggest success achieved by the Spain national football team was the historic treble winning three tournaments in a row : UEFA European Championship in 2008 , FIFA World Cup in 2010 , and UEFA European Championship in 2012 . The men 's national teams of Spain , in all categories , have won a total of 26 titles in FIFA , UEFA , and Olympic tournaments . </P> <P> The First Division of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional , commonly known in the English - speaking world as La Liga , is one of the strongest football leagues in both Europe and the world . At club level , the Spanish football clubs have won a total of 66 international tournaments . They are the most successful in different current European competitions , such as UEFA Champions League , UEFA Super Cup ( shared ) , and UEFA Europa League ; and they also were the most successful in the extinct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup . </P> <P> The characteristic football style of play developed by FC Barcelona , and later by the Spanish national football team is Tiki - taka . This football style is characterised by possessing the ball for large portions of the game , moving the ball quickly from one player to the next , with short and quick passes , keeping the ball away from your opponent , and then to deliver that killer pass to score goal . </P> <P> Professional football in Spain is a sociocultural event that make a significant contribution to the Spanish economy in terms of both demand and supply . In economic terms , during 2013 professional football generated more than € 7.6 billion including direct , indirect and induced effects , representing 0.75 % of Spanish GPD . Moreover , as a result of financial crisis in the last years , many Spanish football clubs in the top two divisions have been facing serious economic troubles due to pay the bank debts . In addition , the European Union authorities have warned to Spanish authorities in order to halt public funding of debt - ridden clubs . </P> <P> Spain national futsal team is one of the strongest teams in the world , being six times champion in the UEFA Futsal Championship , and two times champion in the FIFA Futsal World Championship . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Spanish national football team ( La Roja ) </Li> <Li> 3 Football club competitions </Li> <Li> 4 League ( La Liga ) </Li> <Li> 5 King 's Cup ( Copa del Rey ) </Li> <Li> 6 Spanish Supercup ( Supercopa de España ) </Li> <Li> 7 Spanish clubs in international competitions </Li> <Li> 8 Women 's football </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Modern football was introduced to Spain in the late 19th century by a combination of mostly British immigrant workers , visiting sailors and Spanish students coming from Britain . </P> <P> The oldest football clubs in Spain are Recreativo de Huelva and Sevilla FC . Although Gimnàstic de Tarragona was formed in 1886 , the club did not form an actual football team until 1914 . The first official football game played in Spain took place in Seville on 8 March 1890 at the Tablada Hippodrome . Sevilla FC played against Recreativo de Huelva . With the exception of two Spanish players on the Huelva team and another two players on the Seville team , all the players on both sides were British . Sevilla FC won 2 -- 0 . </P> <P> In the Basque Country during the early 1890s , British shipyard workers and miners formed the Bilbao Football Club and Basque students returning from Britain founded the Athletic Club in 1898 . This early British influence was reflected in the use of English names such as Recreation Club , Athletic Club and Football Club . </P> <P> In Catalonia , which had the most developed industry in Spain , there was an important British colony . The first games played by Britishmen and Catalan people who had studied in the United Kingdom were documented in 1882 in Barcelona . However , the first official and registered football club was Palamós FC ( Costa Brava , North of Catalonia ) in 1898 . The Swiss Hans Gamper founded FC Barcelona on 29 November 1899 . Other clubs were founded in 1900 , such as Sant Andreu , Hispania FC and the Sociedad Española de Football ( one year later the founders changed the name to Real Club Deportivo Español ) . The Catalan Football Federation ( Catalan : Federació Catalana de Futbol ) , responsible for administering football in Catalonia , was the first football association founded in Spain . It was formed on 11 November 1900 as the Football Association of Catalonia ( Catalan : Football Associació de Catalunya ) . The Catalan Football Federation organised the Catalan football championship ( Catalan : Campionat de Catalunya ) that was the first football competition in Spain . </P> <P> In Madrid , the first games were promoted by Institución Libre de Enseñanza ( ILE ) ( English : Free Educational Institution ) , an educational and cultural centre . The first club of Madrid was Football Club Sky , founded in 1897 , but the club separated into two new clubs in 1890 . Then , several clubs also emerged in Madrid , most notably Madrid Football Club , founded in 1902 by Catalan brothers Juan and Carlos Padrós . </P> <P> The Copa del Rey ( English : King 's Cup ) competition was founded in 1903 , one year after a previous football tournament named Coronation Cup . It was Spain 's football national Championship from 1903 until the establishment of the League Championship in 1928 . </P> <P> The Spanish Federation of Football Clubs was formed in 1909 , but there were discrepancies between the member clubs years later , and some of the clubs formed other association called Royal Spanish Union of Clubs of Football . Finally , the two associations reached an agreement and the Royal Spanish Football Federation was founded in 1913 , which allowed the Spanish football to enter in FIFA . In these years , Athletic was the most dominant club in the country , and the first idols in Spain began to appear , like Pichichi and Paulino Alcántara . </P> <P> The Spain national team was created in 1920 on the occasion of the dispute of the Olympic Games in Antwerp . The importance of the success of the Spain national team in the Olympic games , which won the silver medal , was huge in the development of football as mass social event in Spain . The interest on football grew , more people attended to the stadiums , more informations about football appeared in the newspapers , and football was used as element of national prestige and political propaganda . </P> <P> After the Olympic triumph , football was more popular among Spanish fans , the attendances to the stadiums increased , and the pressure of professionalism grew . Spanish football turned professional in 1925 . An agreement between several clubs was made on 23 November 1928 which officially established Spain 's national football division , and the birth of the Spanish League . The first league championship began in 1929 . </P> <P> The Spanish Civil War ( 1936 -- 1939 ) brought disruption to the national competitions . Although the Spanish League was suspended , the Catalan and Valencian clubs continued contesting in the Mediterranean League in early 1937 . Barcelona later toured Mexico and the United States , raising support for the Spanish Republic . </P> <P> The Spanish League and the Cup were restored in the 1939 -- 40 season after Civil War had ended . Francisco Franco 's regime , a fascist political system , began to use football as a propaganda tool for the new regime . In 1941 , as part of his policy of eradicating regional identities , the Franco 's regime banned the use of non-Castilian names . As a result , many clubs that had chosen English prefixes previously , such as Athletic or Football club , had to amend their initial names , for other Castilian ( as Atlético , or Club de Fútbol ) . The Catalan Championship was banned and the Catalan shield taken from FC Barcelona 's badge . Spanish football began to rebuild slowly after the War , but Spain 's isolated international position meant they did not properly re-enter International football until 1950 . Later , Franco 's regime was able to use the football , based on the European triumphs of Real Madrid in the 1950s for political purposes . In this manner , Real Madrid was used as a Spanish brand of success to promote Spain 's image abroad , as well as the pride of being Spanish in the country itself . </P> <P> Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup . </P> <P> Until the 1984 -- 85 season , the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) was responsible for organizing the league tournament . Since then , the competition was organized by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional ( LFP ) ( English : Professional Football League ) , an independent body which was formed at the initiative of the clubs themselves after disagreements with the RFEF regarding the management professionalization and economic division of the League benefits . </P> <P> Since the entry into force of Spanish Law 10 / 1990 , almost all of the clubs competing professionally in Spain are actually companies under the legal status of sports companies , whose ownership is in the hands of its shareholders . Only three professional clubs ( Athletic Club , Barcelona and Real Madrid ) kept its original structure , such as sports clubs directly controlled by their members . </P> <P> After the appearance of private television in Spain , football clubs hugely increased its income thanks to the lucrative contracts to broadcast matches on television . This allowed them to hire many of the best players in the world , but most of the clubs also increased vastly their spending . In the last years La Liga is living in a big financial turmoil . Although the two big powerful clubs , Real Madrid and Barcelona , are at the top in Forbes ' football rich list , the rest of Spanish clubs are weighed down by a colossal debt around € 4.1 billion . For this reason , most of the clubs had to cut their budgets drastically . </P> <H2> Spanish national football team ( La Roja ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Spain national football team Main article : List of Spain international footballers <P> Within Spain , regional teams , most notably the football team of Catalonia , the football team of Basque Country , and even the football team of Galicia , began to compete against each other from 1915 onwards . Despite not being officially recognised by FIFA , these regional teams still occasionally play friendly games with some national team players playing for both teams . Some autonomous governments and social sectors in the historical communities ( especially in Catalonia and Basque Country ) prefer to call their regional teams as national team , while claiming to participate in international tournaments . </P> <P> The Spain national team , commonly referred to as La selección ( English : The selection ) or La Roja ( English : The Red one ) , made their international debut at the 1920 Olympic Games in Belgium and came away with the silver medal . Since then the Spanish national team has participated in a total of fourteen out twenty FIFA World Cup and nine out fourteen UEFA European Championship . Historically , the Spanish national team did not achieve important results , in terms of trophies or develop an attractive playing style . Surprisingly , this fact contrasted with the huge success obtained by the main Spanish football clubs at the European level . Nevertheless , the triumphs of Spanish national team in 2008 and 2012 European Championship , and in 2010 FIFA World Cup , with an attractive playing style , marked a point of inflection that divided the history of Spanish national football team in two parts . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team has been the winner of FIFA Team of Year in 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , as well as the winner of Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2011 . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team have won four trophies in FIFA and UEFA tournaments : one FIFA World Cup in 2010 , and three UEFA European Championship in 1964 , 2008 and 2012 . In addition , it was runner - up in the UEFA European Championship in 1984 and in the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 . </P> <P> The Spain national under - 23 team won the gold medal in 1992 Olympic tournament and the silver medal in 2000 . </P> <P> The Spain national football team won the gold medal at the Mediterranean Games in 2005 and 2007 , the silver medal in 1955 , and the bronze medal in 1963 and 1967 . </P> <P> In addition , the honours list includes numerous titles at junior level teams : </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 21 Championship in 1986 , 1998 , 2011 , and 2013 . </P> <P> FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1999 . </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 19 Championship ( formerly Under - 18 ) in 1995 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2011 2012 and 2015 . </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 17 Championship ( formerly Under - 16 ) in 1986 , 1988 , 1991 , 1997 , 1999 , 2001 , 2007 and 2008 . </P> <P> 1999 Meridian Cup . </P> <P> Spain have won the Maurice Burlaz Trophy , the prize awarded to the national association that has achieved the best results in UEFA 's men 's youth competitions ( UEFA European Under - 19 Championship and UEFA European Under - 17 championship ) over the previous two seasons , in 1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , and 2011 . </P> <P> A short list of some of the top Spanish football players ( grouped by playing positions and era ) which have ever played for the Spanish national team include : </P> <P> Goalkeepers : Ricardo Zamora ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Antoni Ramallets ( 1940s / 1960s ) , José Ángel Iribar ( 1960s / 1980s ) , Luis Arconada ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Andoni Zubizarreta ( 1970s / 1990s ) , Iker Casillas ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Víctor Valdés ( 2000s / 2010s ) , David de Gea ( 2010s ) </P> <P> Defenders : Jacinto Quincoces ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Joan Segarra ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Jesús Garay ( 1950s / 1960s ) , José Santamaría ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Feliciano Rivilla ( 1960s ) , José Antonio Camacho ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Antonio Maceda ( 1980s ) , Rafael Gordillo ( 1970s / 1990s ) , Miguel Ángel Nadal ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Fernando Hierro ( 1980s / 2000s ) , Abelardo Fernández ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Carles Puyol ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Sergio Ramos ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Gerard Piqué ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Jordi Alba ( 2010s ) </P> <P> Midfielders : Josep Samitier ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Martín Marculeta ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Leonardo Cilaurren ( 1920s / 1930s ) , José Luis Panizo ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Antonio Puchades ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Alfredo Di Stéfano ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Luis del Sol ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Luis Suárez ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Luis Aragonés ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Jesús María Pereda ( 1960s ) , Pirri ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Jesús María Zamora ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Míchel ( 1980s / 1990s ) , José Luis Pérez Caminero ( 1990s ) , Luis Enrique ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Pep Guardiola ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Julen Guerrero ( 1990s ) , Gaizka Mendieta ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Xavi ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Xabi Alonso ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Andrés Iniesta ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Santi Cazorla ( 2000s / 2010s ) , David Silva ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Cesc Fàbregas ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Juan Mata ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Sergio Busquets ( 2000s / 2010s ) </P> <P> Forwards : Pichichi ( 1910s / 20s ) , Paulino Alcántara ( 1910s / 1920s ) , Luis Regueiro ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Isidro Lángara ( 1930s ) , César ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Telmo Zarra ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Agustín Gaínza ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Estanislau Basora ( 1940s / 1950s ) , László Kubala ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Ferenc Puskás ( 1960s ) , Francisco Gento ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Amancio Amaro ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Santillana ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Juanito ( 1970s / 1980s , Quini ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Roberto López Ufarte ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Emilio Butragueño ( 1980s / 1990s ) , Julio Salinas ( 1980s / 1990s ) , Raúl ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Fernando Morientes ( 1990s / 2000s ) , David Villa ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Fernando Torres ( 2000s / 2010s ) </P> <H2> Football Club competitions ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of football clubs in Spain Main article : Football records in Spain <P> Currently , the three most important competitions between clubs in Spain are La Liga ( English : League ) , the Copa del Rey ( English : King 's Cup ) and the Supercopa de España ( English : Spanish Supercup ) .

After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part , the RFEF eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first Primera División in 1928 . FC Barcelona , Real Madrid , Athletic Bilbao , Real Sociedad , Arenas Club de Getxo and Real Unión were all selected as previous winners of the Copa del Rey .

Robotically - assisted surgery was developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally - invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery . </P> <P> In the case of robotically - assisted minimally - invasive surgery , instead of directly moving the instruments , the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments ; either a direct telemanipulator or through computer control . A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the robotic arms carry out those movements using end - effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery on the patient . In computer - controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end - effectors , though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input . One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present , but can be anywhere in the world , leading to the possibility for remote surgery . </P> <P> In the case of enhanced open surgery , autonomous instruments ( in familiar configurations ) replace traditional steel tools , performing certain actions ( such as rib spreading ) with much smoother , feedback - controlled motions than could be achieved by a human hand . The main object of such smart instruments is to reduce or eliminate the tissue trauma traditionally associated with open surgery without requiring more than a few minutes ' training on the part of surgeons . This approach seeks to improve open surgeries , particularly cardio - thoracic , that have so far not benefited from minimally - invasive techniques . </P> <P> Robotic surgery has been criticized for its expense , by one estimate costing $1,500 to $2000 more per patient . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Comparison to traditional methods </Li> <Li> 2 Uses <Ul> <Li> 2.1 General surgery </Li> <Li> 2.2 Cardiothoracic surgery </Li> <Li> 2.3 Cardiology and electrophysiology </Li> <Li> 2.4 Colon and rectal surgery </Li> <Li> 2.5 Gastrointestinal surgery </Li> <Li> 2.6 Gynecology </Li> <Li> 2.7 Neurosurgery </Li> <Li> 2.8 Ophthalmology </Li> <Li> 2.9 Orthopedics </Li> <Li> 2.10 Children </Li> <Li> 2.11 Radiosurgery </Li> <Li> 2.12 Spine surgery </Li> <Li> 2.13 Transplant surgery </Li> <Li> 2.14 Urology </Li> <Li> 2.15 Vascular surgery </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Miniature robotics </Li> <Li> 4 History </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional methods ( edit ) </H2> <P> Major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery , minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery . Due to robotic use , the surgery is done with precision , miniaturization , smaller incisions ; decreased blood loss , less pain , and quicker healing time . Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three - dimensional magnification helps resulting in improved ergonomics . Due to these techniques there is a reduced duration of hospital stays , blood loss , transfusions , and use of pain medication . The existing open surgery technique has many flaws like limited access to surgical area , long recovery time , long hours of operation , blood loss , surgical scars and marks . </P> <P> The robot normally costs $1,390,000 and while its disposable supply cost is normally $1,500 per procedure , the cost of the procedure is higher . Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system . Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such systems are worthwhile . As it stands , opinions differ dramatically . Surgeons report that , although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology , the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate on twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt . During the training phase , minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery , leading to operating room tie ups and surgical staffs keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods . Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity , improved outcomes , reduced blood loss and less pain . Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret . </P> <P> Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches , robot - assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site . In addition , surgeons no longer have to stand throughout the surgery and do not tire as quickly . Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot 's computer software . Finally , the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams . </P> <P> Critics of the system , including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , say there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system and that there 's a lack of studies that indicate long - term results are superior to results following traditional laparoscopic surgery . Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon 's experience . </P> <P> A Medicare study found that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to `` minimally invasive '' endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci Surgical System , shortening length - of - stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times . But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is cost - effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used . </P> <P> Robot - assisted pancreatectomies have been found to be associated with `` longer operating time , lower estimated blood loss , a higher spleen - preservation rate , and shorter hospital stay ( s ) '' than laparoscopic pancreatectomies ; there was `` no significant difference in transfusion , conversion to open surgery , overall complications , severe complications , pancreatic fistula , severe pancreatic fistula , ICU stay , total cost , and 30 - day mortality between the two groups . '' For surgical removal of the uterus and cervix for early cervical cancer robotic and laparoscopic surgery resulted in similar outcomes with respect to the cancer . </P> <H2> Uses ( edit ) </H2> <H3> General surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> In early 2000 the field of general surgical interventions with the daVinci device was explored by surgeons at Ohio State University . Reports were published in esophageal and pancreatic surgery for the first time in the world and further data were subsequently published by Horgan and his group at the University of Illinois and then later at the same institution by others . In 2007 , the University of Illinois at Chicago medical team , led by Prof. Pier Cristoforo Giulianotti , reported a pancreatectomy and also the Midwest 's first fully robotic Whipple surgery . In April 2008 , the same team of surgeons performed the world 's first fully minimally invasive liver resection for living donor transplantation , removing 60 % of the patient 's liver , yet allowing him to leave the hospital just a couple of days after the procedure , in very good condition . Furthermore , the patient can also leave with less pain than a usual surgery due to the four puncture holes and not a scar by a surgeon . </P> <H3> Cardiothoracic surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robot - assisted MIDCAB and Endoscopic coronary artery bypass ( TECAB ) operations are being performed with the Da Vinci system . Mitral valve repairs and replacements have been performed . The Ohio State University , Columbus has performed CABG , mitral valve , esophagectomy , lung resection , tumor resections , among other robotic assisted procedures and serves as a training site for other surgeons . In 2002 , surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic in Florida reported and published their preliminary experience with minimally invasive `` hybrid '' procedures . These procedures combined robotic revascularization and coronary stenting and further expanded the role of robots in coronary bypass to patients with disease in multiple vessels . Ongoing research on the outcomes of robotic assisted CABG and hybrid CABG is being done . </P> <H3> Cardiology and electrophysiology ( edit ) </H3> <P> As of 2004 , three types of heart surgery are being performed on a routine basis using robotic surgery systems . These three surgery types were : </P> <Ul> <Li> Atrial septal defect repair -- the repair of a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart , </Li> <Li> Mitral valve repair -- the repair of the valve that prevents blood from regurgitating back into the upper heart chambers during contractions of the heart , </Li> <Li> Coronary artery bypass -- rerouting of blood supply by bypassing blocked arteries that provide blood to the heart . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Colon and rectal surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Many studies have been undertaken in order to examine the role of robotic procedures in the field of colorectal surgery . </P> <P> Results to date indicate that robotic - assisted colorectal procedures outcomes are `` no worse '' than the results in the now `` traditional '' laparoscopic colorectal operations . Robotic - assisted colorectal surgery appears to be safe as well . Most of the procedures have been performed for malignant colon and rectal lesions . However , surgeons are now moving into resections for diverticulitis and non-resective rectopexies ( attaching the colon to the sacrum in order to treat rectal prolapse . ) </P> <P> When evaluated for several variables , robotic - assisted procedures fare equally well when compared with laparoscopic , or open abdominal operations . Study parameters have looked at intraoperative patient preparation time , length of time to perform the operation , adequacy of the removed surgical specimen with respect to clear surgical margins and number of lymph nodes removed , blood loss , operative or postoperative complications and long - term results . </P> <P> More difficult to evaluate are issues related to the view of the operative field , the types of procedures that should be performed using robotic assistance and the potential added cost for a robotic operation . </P> <P> Many surgeons feel that the optics of the 3 - dimensional , two camera stereo optic robotic system are superior to the optical system used in laparoscopic procedures . The pelvic nerves are clearly visualized during robotic - assisted procedures . Less clear however is whether or not these supposedly improved optics and visualization improve patient outcomes with respect to postoperative impotence or incontinence , and whether long - term patient survival is improved by using the 3 - dimensional optic system . Additionally , there is often a need for a wider , or `` larger '' view of the operative field than is routinely provided during robotic operations. , The close - up view of the area under dissection may hamper visualization of the `` bigger view '' , especially with respect to ureteral protection . </P> <P> Questions remain unanswered , even after many years of experience with robotic - assisted colorectal operations . Ongoing studies may help clarify many of the issues of confusion associated with this novel surgical approach . </P> <H3> Gastrointestinal surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Multiple types of procedures have been performed with either the ' Zeus ' or da Vinci robot systems , including bariatric surgery and gastrectomy for cancer . Surgeons at various universities initially published case series demonstrating different techniques and the feasibility of GI surgery using the robotic devices . Specific procedures have been more fully evaluated , specifically esophageal fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia . </P> <P> Other gastrointestinal procedures including colon resection , pancreatectomy , esophagectomy and robotic approaches to pelvic disease have also been reported . </P> <H3> Gynecology ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robotic surgery in gynecology is of uncertain benefit with it being unclear if it affects rates of complications . Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot - assisted surgery but may be associated with a shorter hospital stay following hysterectomy . In the United States , robotic - assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions has been shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy , with no difference in overall rates of complications . </P> <P> This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology . Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids , abnormal periods , endometriosis , ovarian tumors , uterine prolapse , and female cancers . Using the robotic system , gynecologists can perform hysterectomies , myomectomies , and lymph node biopsies . </P> <H3> Neurosurgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Several systems for stereotactic intervention are currently on the market . The NeuroMate was the first neurosurgical robot , commercially available in 1997 . Originally developed in Grenoble by Alim - Louis_Benabid 's team , it is now owned by Renishaw . With installations in the United States , Europe and Japan , the system has been used in 8000 stereotactic brain surgeries by 2009 . IMRIS Inc. 's SYMBIS ( TM ) Surgical System will be the version of NeuroArm , the world 's first MRI - compatible surgical robot , developed for world - wide commercialization . Medtech 's Rosa is being used by several institutions , including the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S , and in Canada at Sherbrooke University and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital in Montreal ( MNI / H ) . Between June 2011 and September 2012 , over 150 neurosurgical procedures at the MNI / H have been completed robotized stereotaxy , including in the placement of depth electrodes in the treatment of epilepsy , selective resections , and stereotaxic biopsies . </P> <H3> Ophthalmology ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first robotic operation inside the eye took place at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on 9 September 2016 . The robot was developed by Preceyes BV and the surgery was performed by Robert MacLaren , Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford . They operated successfully on the Reverend Dr William Beaver , a 70 year old man with a macular hole . The researchers commented that robotic eye surgery has taken longer to develop due to the need to miniaturise the components . They observed that the robot could make controlled movements inside the eye as small as 100th of a millimetre . </P> <H3> Orthopedics ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ROBODOC system was released in 1992 by Integrated Surgical Systems , Inc. which merged into CUREXO Technology Corporation . Also , The Acrobot Company Ltd. developed the `` Acrobot Sculptor '' , a robot that constrained a bone cutting tool to a pre-defined volume . The `` Acrobot Sculptor '' was sold to Stanmore Implants in August 2010 . Stanmore received FDA clearance in February 2013 for US surgeries but sold the Sculptor to Mako Surgical in June 2013 to resolve a patent infringement lawsuit . Another example is the CASPAR robot produced by U.R.S. which is used for total hip replacement , total knee replacement and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction . MAKO Surgical Corp ( founded 2004 ) produces the RIO ( Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System ) which combines robotics , navigation , and haptics for both partial knee and total hip replacement surgery . Blue Belt Technologies received FDA clearance in November 2012 for the Navio Surgical System . The Navio System is a navigated , robotics - assisted surgical system that uses a CT free approach to assist in partial knee replacement surgery . </P> <H3> Children ( edit ) </H3> <P> Surgical robotics has been used in many types of pediatric surgical procedures including : tracheoesophageal fistula repair , cholecystectomy , nissen fundoplication , morgagni 's hernia repair , kasai portoenterostomy , congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair , and others . On 17 January 2002 , surgeons at Children 's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit performed the nation 's first advanced computer - assisted robot - enhanced surgical procedure at a children 's hospital . </P> <P> The Center for Robotic Surgery at Children 's Hospital Boston provides a high level of expertise in pediatric robotic surgery . Specially - trained surgeons use a high - tech robot to perform complex and delicate operations through very small surgical openings . The results are less pain , faster recoveries , shorter hospital stays , smaller scars , and happier patients and families . </P> <P> In 2001 , Children 's Hospital Boston was the first pediatric hospital to acquire a surgical robot . Today , surgeons use the technology for many procedures and perform more pediatric robotic operations than any other hospital in the world . Children 's Hospital physicians have developed a number of new applications to expand the use of the robot , and train surgeons from around the world on its use . </P> <H3> Radiosurgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System uses image guidance and computer controlled robotics to treat tumors throughout the body by delivering multiple beams of high - energy radiation to the tumor from virtually any direction . The system uses a German KUKA KR 240 . Mounted on the robot is a compact X-band linac that produces 6MV X-ray radiation . Mounting the radiation source on the robot allows very fast repositioning of the source , which enables the system to deliver radiation from many different directions without the need to move both the patient and source as required by current gantry configurations . </P> <H3> Spine surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robotic devices started to be used in minimally invasive spine surgery starting in the mid-2000s . As of 2014 , there were too few randomized clinical trials to allow judgements as to whether robotic spine surgery is more or less safe than other approaches . </P> <H3> Transplant surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Transplant surgery ( organ transplantation ) has been considered as highly technically demanding and virtually unobtainable by means of conventional laparoscopy . For many years , transplant patients were unable to benefit from the advantages of minimally invasive surgery . The development of robotic technology and its associated high resolution capabilities , three dimensional visual system , wrist type motion and fine instruments , gave opportunity for highly complex procedures to be completed in a minimally invasive fashion . Subsequently , the first fully robotic kidney transplantations were performed in the late 2000s . After the procedure was proven to be feasible and safe , the main emerging challenge was to determine which patients would benefit most from this robotic technique . As a result , recognition of the increasing prevalence of obesity amongst patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis posed a significant problem . Due to the abundantly higher risk of complications after traditional open kidney transplantation , obese patients were frequently denied access to transplantation , which is the premium treatment for end stage kidney disease . The use of the robotic - assisted approach has allowed kidneys to be transplanted with minimal incisions , which has virtually alleviated wound complications and significantly shortened the recovery period . The University of Illinois Medical Center reported the largest series of 104 robotic - assisted kidney transplants for obese recipients ( mean body mass index > 42 ) . Amongst this group of patients , no wound infections were observed and the function of transplanted kidneys was excellent . In this way , robotic kidney transplantation could be considered as the biggest advance in surgical technique for this procedure since its creation more than half a century ago . </P> <H3> Urology ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robotic surgery in the field of urology has become very popular , especially in the United States . It has been most extensively applied for excision of prostate cancer because of difficult anatomical access . It is also utilized for kidney cancer surgeries and to lesser extent surgeries of the bladder . </P> <P> As of 2014 , there is little evidence of increased benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs . Some have found tentative evidence of more complete removal of cancer and less side effects from surgery for prostatectomy . </P> <P> In 2000 , the first robot - assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed . </P> <H3> Vascular surgery ( edit ) </H3> <P> In September 2010 , the first robotic operations with Hansen Medical 's Magellan Robotic System at the femoral vasculature were performed at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana ( UMC Ljubljana ) , Slovenia . The research was led by Borut Geršak , the head of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the centre . Geršak explained that the robot used was the first true robot in the history of robotic surgery , meaning the user interface was not resembling surgical instruments and the robot was not simply imitating the movement of human hands but was guided by pressing buttons , just like one would play a video game . The robot was imported to Slovenia from the United States . </P> <H2> Miniature robotics ( edit ) </H2> <P> As scientists seek to improve the versatility and utility of robotics in surgery , some are attempting to miniaturize the robots . For example , the University of Nebraska Medical Center has led a multi-campus effort to provide collaborative research on mini-robotics among surgeons , engineers and computer scientists . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first robot to assist in surgery was the Arthrobot , which was developed and used for the first time in Vancouver in 1983 . Intimately involved were biomedical engineer , Dr. James McEwen , Geof Auchinleck , a UBC engineering physics grad , and Dr. Brian Day as well as a team of engineering students . The robot was used in an orthopaedic surgical procedure on 12 March 1984 , at the UBC Hospital in Vancouver . Over 60 arthroscopic surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months , and a 1985 National Geographic video on industrial robots , The Robotics Revolution , featured the device . Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical scrub nurse robot , which handed operative instruments on voice command , and a medical laboratory robotic arm . A YouTube video entitled Arthrobot illustrates some of these in operation . </P> <P> In 1985 a robot , the Unimation Puma 200 , was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT guidance . In 1992 , the PROBOT , developed at Imperial College London , was used to perform prostatic surgery by Dr. Senthil Nathan at Guy 's and St Thomas ' Hospital , London . This was the first pure robotic surgery in the world . The PROBOT was specifically designed for transurethral resection of the prostate . Meanwhile , when PROBOT was being developed , ROBODOC , a robotic system designed to assist hip replacement surgeries was the first surgical robot that was approved by the FDA . The ROBODOC from Integrated Surgical Systems ( working closely with IBM ) was introduced in 1992 to mill out precise fittings in the femur for hip replacement . The purpose of the ROBODOC was to replace the previous method of carving out a femur for an implant , the use of a mallet and broach / rasp . </P> <P> Further development of robotic systems was carried out by SRI International and Intuitive Surgical with the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System and Computer Motion with the AESOP and the ZEUS robotic surgical system . The first robotic surgery took place at The Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus , Ohio under the direction of Robert E. Michler . Examples of using ZEUS include a fallopian tube reconnection in July 1998 , a beating heart coronary artery bypass graft in October 1999 , and the Lindbergh Operation , which was a cholecystectomy performed remotely in September 2001 . </P> <P> The original telesurgery robotic system that the da Vinci was based on was developed at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and NASA . Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to facilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote environments , it turned out to be more useful for minimally invasive on - site surgery . The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical in Mountain View , California . The da Vinci senses the surgeon 's hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled - down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments . It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon 's hand movements , so that they are not duplicated robotically . The camera used in the system provides a true stereoscopic picture transmitted to a surgeon 's console . Examples of using the da Vinci system include the first robotically assisted heart bypass ( performed in Germany ) in May 1998 , and the first performed in the United States in September 1999 ; and the first all - robotic - assisted kidney transplant , performed in January 2009 . The da Vinci Si was released in April 2009 , and initially sold for $1.75 million . </P> <P> In May 2006 the first artificial intelligence doctor - conducted unassisted robotic surgery on a 34 - year - old male to correct heart arythmia . The results were rated as better than an above - average human surgeon . The machine had a database of 10,000 similar operations , and so , in the words of its designers , was `` more than qualified to operate on any patient '' . In August 2007 , Dr. Sijo Parekattil of the Robotics Institute and Center for Urology ( Winter Haven Hospital and University of Florida ) performed the first robotic assisted microsurgery procedure denervation of the spermatic cord for chronic testicular pain . In February 2008 , Dr. Mohan S. Gundeti of the University of Chicago Comer Children 's Hospital performed the first robotic pediatric neurogenic bladder reconstruction . </P> <P> On 12 May 2008 , the first image - guided MR - compatible robotic neurosurgical procedure was performed at University of Calgary by Dr. Garnette Sutherland using the NeuroArm . In June 2008 , the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) presented a robotic system for minimally invasive surgery , the MiroSurge . In September 2010 , the Eindhoven University of Technology announced the development of the Sofie surgical system , the first surgical robot to employ force feedback . In September 2010 , the first robotic operation at the femoral vasculature was performed at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana by a team led by Borut Geršak . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Bone segment navigation </Li> <Li> Computer - assisted surgery </Li> <Li> Computer - integrated surgery </Li> <Li> Minimally invasive surgery </Li> <Li> Patient registration </Li> <Li> Stereolithography ( medicine ) </Li> <Li> Surgical Segment Navigator </Li> <Li> Telemedicine </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kolata , Gina ( 13 February 2010 ) . `` Results Unproven , Robotic Surgery Wins Converts '' .

Icona Pop . </P> <P> The song received positive reviews from music critics , and publications Rolling Stone and Pitchfork included it on their year - end lists for 2012 . The song went on to become Icona Pop and Charli XCX 's first US hit , peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double - platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , denoting over 2 million copies sold in the United States . In June 2013 , over a year after it was released elsewhere , the song charted at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart . It has gone on to sell 4.3 million certified downloads . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Composition </Li> <Li> 3 Release and promotion </Li> <Li> 4 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 5 Music video </Li> <Li> 6 Track listing </Li> <Li> 7 Charts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 7.2 Year - end charts </Li> <Li> 7.3 All - time chart </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Sales and certifications </Li> <Li> 9 Cover versions </Li> <Li> 10 Release history </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> Singer Charli XCX co-wrote and recorded an earlier version of `` I Love It '' . <P> The song was originally written by Charli XCX , whom Icona Pop met several times in London . Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats , and she quickly wrote songs for each of them , one of which became `` I Love It '' and the other of which became her following single `` You 're the One '' . However , she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound . </P> <P> While recording `` Good for You '' with Icona Pop , Berger presented them with Charli 's work on `` I Love It '' . Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences , and the line `` You 're from the 70s but I 'm a 90s bitch '' reminded her of an older man she had known . Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX 's original demo as `` more cute , in a way ... really cool and cocky '' . Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track , telling him , `` We want the punkiness . We want the ' fuck it ' feeling .

See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> `` I Love It '' is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute ( Allegro ) , and is described as an electropop and dance - pop song . It is written in A ♭ major , with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression . Billboard critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its `` swells of revving synths '' and prominent sub-bass sounds . Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was `` basically just two - and - a-half minutes of drop '' ; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track 's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music . </P> <P> The song 's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend . In its chorus , Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison `` I do n't care / I love it '' . Critics compared the song 's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson 's 2004 single `` Since U Been Gone '' , and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for Spin that the track 's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo . </P> <H2> Release and promotion ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` I Love It '' was released in Sweden in May 2012 . It entered the Swedish Singles Chart the following month at number 48 , and after two months on the chart , the song peaked at number two for three consecutive weeks . After its January 2013 appearance on an episode of Girls , the song performed better in digital downloads than it had upon initial release . Ten days later it entered the Billboard Hot 100 , eventually climbing to number seven on the chart . Jawo and Hjelt 's first performance with Charli XCX happened in April 2013 , after seeing her back stage at a South by Southwest showcase where both acts were playing . </P> <P> In June 2013 , several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart , including one by vlogger Venus Angelic . When Icona Pop released their version , it entered at the top of the chart , overtaking Robin Thicke 's `` Blurred Lines '' featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` I Love It '' was met with positive reviews from music critics . The song placed 15th on The Village Voice 's 2012 Pazz & Jop list , and it rose to eighth place the following year . Pitchfork Media labeled it `` Best New Music '' , calling the song `` delectable , empowering , infinitely repeatable '' . Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its `` Top 100 Tracks of 2012 '' list . Rolling Stone placed `` I Love It '' at number 35 on its year - end list , naming it `` the Euro - slut club jam of the summer '' . Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as `` fun '' , Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt `` half - sung , half - shouted vocals and revved - up synths make the song inescapably catchy '' . Kat Bein of the Miami New Times called the song a `` feminist pop anthem '' . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> The music video for `` I Love It '' was directed by Fredrik Etoall . The video was shot in a day by friends of the band while they were in Paris . It shows Jawo and Hjelt playing a show for a crowd shouting the lyrics and dancing , with additional shots from backstage and an after - party . It also includes outdoor shots of them wearing fringed jackets that they made . Charli XCX does not appear in the video . </P> <H2> Track listing ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""3""> Digital download </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th>

Her first name is derived from Lakshmi , a Hindu goddess . </P> <P> In The Phantom Menace , she and her son are introduced as slaves of junk merchant Watto on the desert world Tatooine . She welcomes Jedi Master Qui - Gon Jinn ( Liam Neeson ) into their home , and tells him that Anakin has no father ; she simply `` became '' pregnant with him . Qui - Gon helps Anakin win his freedom , but can not get Shmi out of slavery . She allows Anakin to leave with Qui - Gon , assuring her heartbroken son that they will meet again . </P> <P> In Attack of the Clones , Anakin ( Hayden Christensen ) , now a young adult Jedi apprentice , senses through the Force that she is in pain . He travels to Tatooine to find her , and , upon arriving , learns that she had been freed by and married to moisture farmer Cliegg Lars ( Jack Thompson ) , but had recently been abducted by Tusken Raiders . He finds her inside one of their encampments , but it 's too late -- beaten and tortured beyond help , she dies in his arms . Heartbroken and enraged , Anakin slaughters every single Tusken in the camp , including the women and children .

After the death of Qui - Gon , he becomes the Padawan of Obi - Wan Kenobi . He also forms a close bond with Padmé Amidala , the young senator of Naboo . The newly elected Chancellor of the Galactic Republic , Palpatine , also befriends Anakin , promising to watch the boy 's progress `` with great interest '' and advise him .

In Return of the Jedi , a dying Yoda confirms to Luke , that Darth Vader ( previously Anakin Skywalker ) is actually his father , despite Luke 's belief that Vader 's claim to fatherhood in The Empire Strikes Back was a ruse to pull Luke to the dark side . He also finds out from Obi - Wan 's force ghost that Princess Leia Organa is his sister .

In Return of the Jedi , planning to feed Luke , Han , and Chewbacca to the flesh eating Sarlacc , Jabba the Hutt is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her . She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor . In the years that follow , she becomes General Organa , the leader of the Resistance , a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order . She married Han Solo and had a son named Ben Solo , later Kylo Ren , whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of The Force Awakens .

The capital and largest city is Harare . A country of roughly 16 million people , Zimbabwe has 16 official languages , with English , Shona , and Ndebele the most commonly used . </P> <P> Since the 11th century , present - day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade . The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s ; it became the self - governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 . In 1965 , the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia . The state endured international isolation and a 15 - year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces ; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980 . Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations , which it withdrew from in December 2003 . It is a member of the United Nations , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union ( AU ) , and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) . It was once known as the `` Jewel of Africa '' for its prosperity . </P> <P> Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 , when his ZANU - PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule ; he was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his resignation in 2017 . Under Mugabe 's authoritarian regime , the state security apparatus dominated the country and was responsible for widespread human rights violations . Mugabe maintained the revolutionary socialist rhetoric of the Cold War era , blaming Zimbabwe 's economic woes on conspiring Western capitalist countries . Contemporary African political leaders were reluctant to criticise Mugabe , who was burnished by his anti-imperialist credentials , though Archbishop Desmond Tutu called him `` a cartoon figure of an archetypal African dictator '' .

Two different theories address the origin of the word . Many sources hold that `` Zimbabwe '' derives from dzimba - dza - mabwe , translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as `` large houses of stone '' ( dzimba = plural of imba , `` house '' ; mabwe = plural of bwe , `` stone '' ) . The Karanga - speaking Shona people live around Great Zimbabwe in the modern - day province of Masvingo . Archaeologist Peter Garlake claims that `` Zimbabwe '' represents a contracted form of dzimba - hwe , which means `` venerated houses '' in the Zezuru dialect of Shona and usually references chiefs ' houses or graves . </P> <P> Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia ( 1898 ) , Rhodesia ( 1965 ) , and Zimbabwe Rhodesia ( 1979 ) . The first recorded use of `` Zimbabwe '' as a term of national reference dates from 1960 as a coinage by the black nationalist Michael Mawema , whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961 . The term `` Rhodesia '' -- derived from the surname of Cecil Rhodes , the primary instigator of British colonisation of the territory during the late 19th century -- was perceived by African nationalists as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations . </P> <P> According to Mawema , black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country , proposing names such as `` Matshobana '' and `` Monomotapa '' before his suggestion , `` Zimbabwe '' , prevailed . A further alternative , put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland , had been `` Matopos '' , referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo . </P> <P> It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used -- a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to `` Zimbabweland '' -- but `` Zimbabwe '' was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement . In a 2001 interview , black nationalist Edson Zvobgo recalled that Mawema mentioned the name during a political rally , `` and it caught hold , and that was that '' . The black nationalist factions subsequently used the name during the Second Chimurenga campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the Rhodesian Bush War of 1964 -- 1979 . Major factions in this camp included the Zimbabwe African National Union ( led by Robert Mugabe from 1975 ) , and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s ) . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of Zimbabwe <H3> Precolonial era ( 1000 -- 1887 ) ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Bantu expansion Towers of Great Zimbabwe . <P> Proto - Shona - speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands . The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states , beginning around the 10th century . Around the early 10th century , trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast , helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 11th century . This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries , evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe , near Masvingo , and other smaller sites . The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal . They traded in gold , ivory , and copper for cloth and glass . </P> <P> From about 1300 until 1600 , Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe . This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe 's stone architecture , which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom 's capital of Great Zimbabwe . From c. 1450 to 1760 , Zimbabwe gave way to the Kingdom of Mutapa . This Shona state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today , and parts of central Mozambique . It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire , also known as Mwene Mutapa or Monomotapa as well as `` Munhumutapa '' , and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal . The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century . </P> <P> As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior , and especially due to the increasing amount of Carnegie family farmers , a new Shona state emerged , known as the Rozwi Empire . Relying on centuries of military , political and religious development , the Rozwi ( meaning `` destroyers '' ) expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau by force of arms . They continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding muskets to their arsenal and recruiting a professional army to defend recent conquests . </P> <P> Around 1821 , the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan successfully rebelled against King Shaka and created his own clan , the Ndebele . The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal , leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane . When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836 , they drove the tribe even further northward . By 1838 , the Rozwi Empire , along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom . </P> <P> After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840 , Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present - day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland , establishing Bulawayo as their capital . Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals , similar to those of Shaka , which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions . Mzilikazi died in 1868 and , following a violent power struggle , was succeeded by his son , Lobengula . </P> <H3> Colonial era and Rhodesia ( 1888 -- 1964 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Company rule in Rhodesia , Southern Rhodesia , and Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

In 1888 , Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples . He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over Matabeleland , and its subject states such as Mashonaland as well . </P> <P> Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column , a group of Europeans protected by well - armed British South Africa Police ( BSAP ) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury ( now Harare ) , and thereby establish company rule over the area . In 1893 and 1894 , with the help of their new Maxim guns , the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the First Matabele War . Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika , then known as `` Zambesia '' . </P> <P> In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties , mass settlement was encouraged , with the British maintaining control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources . </P> <P> In 1895 , the BSAC adopted the name `` Rhodesia '' for the territory , in honour of Rhodes . In 1898 `` Southern Rhodesia '' became the official name for the region south of the Zambezi , which later became Zimbabwe . The region to the north was administered separately and later termed Northern Rhodesia ( now Zambia ) . Shortly after Rhodes ' disastrous Jameson Raid on the South African Republic , the Ndebele rebelled against white rule , led by their charismatic religious leader , Mlimo . The Second Matabele War lasted in Matabeleland until 1896 , when Mlimo was assassinated . Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts ( known as Chimurenga ) against company rule during 1896 and 1897 . </P> <P> Following these failed insurrections , the Ndebele and Shona groups were finally subdued by the Rhodes administration , which organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans , thus displacing many indigenous peoples . </P> The opening of the railway to Umtali in 1899 . <P> Southern Rhodesia was annexed by the United Kingdom on 12 September 1923 . Shortly after annexation , on 1 October 1923 , the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force . </P> <P> Under the new constitution , Southern Rhodesia became a self - governing British colony , subsequent to a 1922 referendum . Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the United Kingdom during the two World Wars . Proportional to the white population , Southern Rhodesia contributed more per capita to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the Empire , including Britain itself . </P> <P> In 1953 , in the face of African opposition , Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland ( Malawi ) in the ill - fated Central African Federation , which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia . Growing African nationalism and general dissent , particularly in Nyasaland , persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963 , forming three separate divisions . While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , however , Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule . </P> <P> With Zambian independence , Ian Smith 's Rhodesian Front ( RF ) dropped the designation `` Southern '' in 1964 and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( commonly abbreviated to `` UDI '' ) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 , intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of `` no independence before majority rule '' . It was the first such course taken by a British colony since the American declaration of 1776 , which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions . </P> <H3> UDI and civil War ( 1965 -- 1980 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Rhodesia , Rhodesian Bush War , Zimbabwe Rhodesia , and Lancaster House Agreement <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

In December 1966 , the organisation complied , imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state . These sanctions were expanded again in 1968 . </P> <P> The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion , but did not re-establish control by force . A guerrilla war subsequently ensued when Joshua Nkomo 's Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( ZAPU ) and Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) , supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations , initiated guerilla operations against Rhodesia 's predominantly white government . ZAPU was supported by the Soviet Union , the Warsaw Pact and associated nations such as Cuba , and adopted a Marxist -- Leninist ideology ; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by the People 's Republic of China . Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 , following the results of a referendum the previous year , but this went unrecognised internationally . Meanwhile , Rhodesia 's internal conflict intensified , eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant nationalists . </P> Bishop Abel Muzorewa signs the Lancaster House Agreement seated next to British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington . <P> In March 1978 , Smith reached an accord with three African leaders , led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa , who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy . As a result of the Internal Settlement , elections were held in April 1979 , concluding with the United African National Council ( UANC ) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats . On 1 June 1979 , Muzorewa , the UANC head , became prime minister and the country 's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia . The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces , civil service , judiciary , and a third of parliament seats to whites . On 12 June , the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia . </P> <P> Following the fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) , held in Lusaka , Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979 , the British government invited Muzorewa , Mugabe , and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House . The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution , and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence . </P> <P> With Lord Carrington , Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom , in the chair , these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979 , producing a total of 47 plenary sessions . On 21 December 1979 , delegations from every major interest represented reached the Lancaster House Agreement , effectively ending the guerrilla war . </P> <P> On 11 December 1979 , the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to British colonial status ( the ' aye ' votes included Ian Smith himself ) . The bill then passed the Senate and was assented to by the President . With the arrival of Lord Soames , the new Governor , just after 2 p.m. on 12 December 1979 , Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia , although on 13 December Soames declared that during his mandate the name Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia would continue to be used . Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December , and the United Nations on 16 December , before calling on its member states to do likewise on 21 December . Thus Zambia , Mozambique , Tanzania , Angola and Botswana lifted sanctions on 22 -- 23 December ; Australia partly pre-empted this , lifting all but trade sanctions on 18 December , and trade sanctions on 21 December . </P> <P> During the elections of February 1980 , Robert Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory . Prince Charles , as the representative of Britain , formally granted independence to the new nation of Zimbabwe at a ceremony in Harare in April 1980 . </P> <H3> Independence era ( 1980 -- present ) ( edit ) </H3> Trends in Zimbabwe 's Multidimensional Poverty Index , 1970 -- 2010 . <P> Zimbabwe 's first president after its independence was Canaan Banana in what was originally a mainly ceremonial role as Head of State . Robert Mugabe , leader of the ZANU party , was the country 's first Prime Minister and Head of Government . </P> <P> Opposition to what was perceived as a Shona takeover immediately erupted around Matabeleland . The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as Gukurahundi ( Shona : `` the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains '' ) . The Fifth Brigade , a North Korean - trained elite unit that reported directly to the Zimbabwean Prime Minister , entered Matabeleland and massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting `` dissidents '' . </P> <P> Estimates for the number of deaths during the five - year Gukurahundi campaign ranged from 3,750 to 80,000 . Thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps . The campaign officially ended in 1987 after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective parties , creating the Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front ( ZANU -- PF ) . </P> <P> Elections in March 1990 resulted in another victory for Mugabe and the ZANU - PF party , which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seats . </P> <P> During the 1990s , students , trade unionists , and other workers often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with Mugabe and ZANU - PF party policies . In 1996 , civil servants , nurses , and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues . The general health of the population also began to significantly decline ; by 1997 an estimated 25 % of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa . </P> <P> Land redistribution re-emerged as the main issue for the ZANU - PF government around 1997 . Despite the existence of a `` willing - buyer - willing - seller '' land reform programme since the 1980s , the minority white Zimbabwean population of around 0.6 % continued to hold 70 % of the country 's most fertile agricultural land . </P> <P> In 2000 , the government pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme , a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population . Confiscations of white farmland , continuous droughts , and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports , which were traditionally the country 's leading export - producing sector . Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale . </P> Map showing the food insecurity in Zimbabwe in June 2008 <P> President Mugabe and the ZANU - PF party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanctions . In 2002 , the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant election tampering . The following year , Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership . </P> <P> The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 ( ZDERA ) went into effect in 2002 , creating a credit freeze of the Zimbabwean government through Section 4 C , Multilateral Financing Restriction . The bill was sponsored by Bill Frist , and co-sponsored by US senators Hillary Clinton , Joe Biden , Russ Feingold and Jesse Helms . Through ZDERA Section 4C , the Secretary of the Treasury is ordered to direct US Directors at the International Financial Institutions listed in Section 3 , `` to oppose and vote against -- ( 1 ) any extension by the respective institution of any loan , credit , or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe ; or ( 2 ) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any international financial institution . '' </P> <P> Following elections in 2005 , the government initiated `` Operation Murambatsvina '' , an effort to crack down on illegal markets and slums emerging in towns and cities , leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless . The Zimbabwean government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population , although according to critics such as Amnesty International , authorities have yet to properly substantiate their claims . </P> <P> On 29 March 2008 , Zimbabwe held a presidential election along with a parliamentary election . The results of this election were withheld for two weeks , after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change -- Tsvangirai ( MDC - T ) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament . </P> <P> In late 2008 , problems in Zimbabwe reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards , public health ( with a major cholera outbreak in December ) and various basic affairs . </P> <P> In September 2008 , a power - sharing agreement was reached between Tsvangirai and President Mugabe , permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister . Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties , the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009 . By December 2010 , Mugabe was threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned companies in Zimbabwe unless `` western sanctions '' were lifted . </P> Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe attended the Independence Day celebrations in South Sudan in July 2011 <P> A 2011 survey by Freedom House suggested that living conditions had improved since the power - sharing agreement . The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated in its 2012 -- 2013 planning document that the `` humanitarian situation has improved in Zimbabwe since 2009 , but conditions remain precarious for many people '' . </P> <P> On 17 January 2013 , Vice President John Nkomo died of cancer at St Anne 's Hospital , Harare at the age of 78 . A new constitution approved in the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum , 2013 curtails presidential powers . </P> <P> Mugabe was re-elected president in the July 2013 Zimbabwean general election which The Economist described as `` rigged . '' and the Daily Telegraph as `` stolen '' . The Movement for Democratic Change alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the courts . In a surprising moment of candour at the ZANU - PF congress in December 2014 , President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73 % . After winning the election , the Mugabe ZANU - PF government re-instituted one party rule , doubled the civil service and , according to The Economist , embarked on `` misrule and dazzling corruption '' . A 2017 study conducted by the Institute for Security Studies ( ISS ) concluded that due to the deterioration of government and the economy `` the government encourages corruption to make up for its inability to fund its own institutions '' with widespread and informal police roadblocks to issue fines to travellers being one manifestation of this . </P> <P> In July 2016 nationwide protests took place regarding the economic collapse in the country , and the finance minister admitted `` Right now we literally have nothing . '' </P> <P> In November 2017 , the army led a coup d'état following the dismissal of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa , placing Mugabe under house arrest . The army denied that their actions constituted a coup . Mugabe resigned on 21 November 2017 , after leading the country for 37 years . Although under the Constitution of Zimbabwe Mugabe should be succeeded by Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko , a supporter of Grace Mugabe , ZANU - PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke stated to the Reuters news agency that Mnangagwa would be appointed as president . </P> <P> In December 2017 the website Zimbabwe News , calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics , said that at the time of independence in 1980 , the country was growing economically at about 5 per cent a year , and had done so for quite a long time . If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years , Zimbabwe would have in 2016 a GDP of US $52 billion . Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US $14 billion , a cost of US $38 billion in lost growth . The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3 , 5 per cent per annum , doubling every 21 years . Had this growth been maintained , the population would have been 31 million . Instead , as of 2018 , it is about 13 million . The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease , and partly due to decreased fertility . The life expectancy has halved , and death from politically motivated violence sponsored by government exceeds 200,000 since 1980 . The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least 3 million Zimbabweans in 37 years . </P> <H2> Geography and environment ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Zimbabwe map of Köppen climate classification . <P> Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa , lying between latitudes 15 ° and 23 ° S , and longitudes 25 ° and 34 ° E. It is bordered by South Africa to the south , Botswana to the west and southwest , Zambia to the northwest , and Mozambique to the east and northeast . Its northwest corner is roughly 150 meters from Namibia , nearly forming a four - nation quadripoint . Most of the country is elevated , consisting of a central plateau ( high veld ) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m . The country 's extreme east is mountainous , this area being known as the Eastern Highlands , with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m . </P> <P> These highlands are renowned for their great natural beauty , with famous tourist destinations such as Nyanga , Troutbeck , Chimanimani , Vumba and Chirinda Forest at Mount Selinda . About 20 % of the country consists of low - lying areas , ( the low veld ) under 900m . Victoria Falls , one of the world 's biggest and most spectacular waterfalls , is located in the country 's extreme northwest and is part of the Zambezi river . </P> <H3> Climate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zimbabwe has a tropical climate with many local variations . The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity , parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter , the Zambezi valley is also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country . The country 's rainy season generally runs from late October to March and the hot climate is moderated by increasing altitude .

Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns . </P> <H2> Government and Politics ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Politics of Zimbabwe and Elections in Zimbabwe <P> Zimbabwe is a republic with a presidential system of government . The semi-presidential system was abolished with the adoption of a new constitution after a referendum in March 2013 . Under the constitutional changes in 2005 , an upper chamber , the Senate , was reinstated . The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament . Former President Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front ( commonly abbreviated ZANU - PF ) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence . </P> <P> In 1987 then - prime minister Mugabe revised the constitution , abolishing the ceremonial presidency and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president , a Presidential system . His ZANU party has won every election since independence , in the 1990 election the second - placed party , Edgar Tekere 's Zimbabwe Unity Movement , won only 20 % of the vote . </P> <P> During the 1995 parliamentary elections most opposition parties , including the ZUM , boycotted the voting , resulting in a near - sweep by the ruling party . When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000 , they won 57 seats , only five fewer than ZANU . </P> <P> Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote - rigging , intimidation and fraud . The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging , election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and Jonathan Moyo , calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies . Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament . </P> <P> General elections were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008 . The official results required a runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader ; the MDC challenged these results , claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government . </P> <P> The run - off was scheduled for 27 June 2008 . On 22 June , citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a `` violent , illegitimate sham of an election process '' , Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run - off , the ZEC held the run - off and President Mugabe received a landslide majority . </P> Supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change in 2005 . <P> The MDC - T led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now the majority in the Lower chamber of Parliament . The MDC split into two factions . One faction ( MDC - M ) , now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate , while the other , led by Tsvangirai , opposed to contesting the elections , stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe 's claim that past elections were free and fair . The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006 . The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC - T , which has become more popular than the other group . </P> <P> Mutambara , a robotics professor and former NASA robotics specialist has replaced Welshman Ncube who was the interim leader of MDC - M after the split . Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections , while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the Senate . The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto . As of 2008 , the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular , with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500 -- 5,000 for the other formation . </P> <P> On 28 April 2008 , Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in Johannesburg that the two MDC formations were co-operating , enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority . Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain President without a parliamentary majority . On the same day , Silaigwana announced that the recounts for the final five constituencies had been completed , that the results were being collated and that they would be published on 29 April . </P> <P> In mid-September 2008 , after protracted negotiations overseen by the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique , Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power - sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army . Donor nations have adopted a ' wait - and - see ' attitude , wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts , which are estimated to take at least five years . On 11 February 2009 Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Mugabe . </P> <P> In November 2008 , the government of Zimbabwe spent US $7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria . A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent , except that it was not for the intended purpose , and the government has failed to honour requests to return the money . </P> <P> In February 2013 , Zimbabwe 's election chief , Simpson Mtambanengwe , resigned due to ill health . His resignation came months before the country 's constitutional referendum and elections . </P> <H3> Human Rights ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Human rights in Zimbabwe <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

Protests are discouraged by Zimbabwean police in Zimbabwe . <P> There are widespread reports of systematic and escalating violations of human rights in Zimbabwe under the Mugabe administration and the dominant party , the ZANU - PF . </P> <P> In 2011 , there were reports of 640 corpses having been recovered from the Monkey William Mine in Chibondo . They were allegedly authenticated by the Fallen Heroes Trust of Zimbabwe and the Department of National Museums and Monuments who are leading the exhumation process as victims of the Ian Smith regime during the Rhodesian Bush War . One body was identified as a ZANLA cadre , Cde Rauya , by the Fallen Heroes Trust Chief exhumer . </P> <P> Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere admitted the remains were discovered in 2008 , but claimed the remains were decades old despite clear evidence the exhumed skeletons still had hair and clothes . Solidarity Peace Trust said that the presence of soft tissues `` is not necessarily an indicator that these bones entered the grave more recently , although it could be . '' </P> <P> Journalists found a body in the mine with ' what appeared to be blood and fluids dripping onto the skulls below ' . The opposition MDC called for research on all violence that included killings of its supporters during disputed elections in 2008 . Amnesty International ( AI ) expressed concern that `` international best practice on exhumations is not being adhered to ... ( M ) ishandling of these mass graves has serious implications on potential exhumations of other sites in Zimbabwe . Thousands of civilians were also killed in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in the mid 1980s and are allegedly buried in mine shafts and mass graves in these regions '' , AI added . </P> <P> According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the government of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter , food , freedom of movement and residence , freedom of assembly and the protection of the law . In 2009 , Gregory Stanton , then President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars , stated there was `` clear evidence that Mugabe government was guilty of crimes against humanity and that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the International Criminal Court . </P> <P> Male homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe . Since 1995 , the government has carried out campaigns against both homosexual men and women . President Mugabe has blamed gays for many of Zimbabwe 's problems and viewed homosexuality as an `` un-African '' and immoral culture brought by European colonists and practiced by only `` a few whites '' in his country . </P> <P> Opposition gatherings are frequently the subject of brutal attacks by the police force , such as the crackdown on an 11 March 2007 Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) rally and several others during the 2008 election campaign . </P> <P> In the attacks of 2007 , party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other opposition activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police . After his release , Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC that he suffered head injuries and blows to the arms , knees and back , and that he lost a significant amount of blood and hundreds were killed . </P> <P> Police action was strongly condemned by the UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki - moon , the European Union and the United States . While noting that the activists had suffered injuries , but not mentioning the cause of them , the Zimbabwean state - owned daily newspaper The Herald claimed the police had intervened after demonstrators `` ran amok looting shops , destroying property , mugging civilians , and assaulting police officers and innocent members of the public '' . The newspaper argued that the opposition had been `` willfully violating the ban on political rallies '' . </P> <P> There are also abuses of media rights and access . The Zimbabwean government is accused of suppressing freedom of the press and freedom of speech . It has been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster , the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation , as a propaganda tool . Newspapers critical of the government , such as the Daily News , closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their license . BBC News , Sky News , and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe . In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted . Sky News continue to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa . </P> <H3> Armed Forces ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army ( ZNA ) and Air Force of Zimbabwe ( AFZ ) as separate entities under the command of Rtd General Solomon Mujuru and Air Marshal Norman Walsh who retired in 1982 , and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai in 1985 . </P> <P> In December 2003 , General Constantine Chiwenga , was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces . Lieutenant General P.V. Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army . </P> <P> The ZNA currently has an active duty strength of 30,000 . The Air Force has about 5,139 standing personnel . The Zimbabwe Republic Police ( includes Police Support Unit , Paramilitary Police ) is part of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and numbers 25,000 . </P> <P> Following majority rule in early 1980 , British Army trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces . For the first year , a system was followed where the top - performing candidate became battalion commander . If he or she was from ZANLA , then his or her second - in - command was the top - performing ZIPRA candidate , and vice versa . This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure . From early 1981 , this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments , and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA . </P> <P> The ZNA was originally formed into four brigades , composed of a total of 28 battalions . The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army , while unintegrated battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles were assigned to the 1st , 3rd and 4th Brigades . The Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after the demonstration of mass brutality and murder during the brigade 's occupation of Matabeleland in what has become known as Gukurahundi ( Shona : `` the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains '' ) , the campaign which finished off Mugabe 's liberation struggle . The Brigade had been re-formed by 2006 , with its commander , Brigadier - General John Mupande praising its `` rich history '' . </P> <H3> Administrative divisions ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Provinces of Zimbabwe , Districts of Zimbabwe , and Wards of Zimbabwe Administrative divisions of Zimbabwe <P> Zimbabwe has a centralised government and is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status , for administrative purposes . Each province has a provincial capital from where government administration is usually carried out . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Province </Th> <Th> Capital </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bulawayo </Td> <Td> Bulawayo </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Harare </Td> <Td> Harare </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Manicaland </Td> <Td> Mutare </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mashonaland Central </Td> <Td> Bindura </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mashonaland East </Td> <Td> Marondera </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mashonaland West </Td> <Td> Chinhoyi </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Masvingo </Td> <Td> Masvingo city </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Matabeleland North </Td> <Td> Lupane District </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Matabeleland South </Td> <Td> Gwanda </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Midlands </Td> <Td> Gweru </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The names of most of the provinces were generated from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation : Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War . This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people , although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces . Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor , appointed by the President . </P> <P> The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator , appointed by the Public Service Commission . Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments . </P> <P> The provinces are subdivided into 59 districts and 1,200 wards ( sometimes referred to as municipalities ) . Each district is headed by a District Administrator , appointed by the Public Service Commission . There is also a Rural District Council , which appoints a chief executive officer . The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors , the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs ( traditional leaders appointed under customary law ) in the district . Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments . </P> <P> At the ward level there is a Ward Development Committee , comprising the elected ward councillor , the kraalheads ( traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs ) and representatives of Village Development Committees . Wards are subdivided into villages , each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman ( traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead ) . </P> <H2> Economy ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Economy of Zimbabwe A proportional representation of Zimbabwe 's exports , 2010 <P> Minerals , gold , and agriculture are the main foreign exports of Zimbabwe . Tourism also plays a key role in its economy . </P> <P> The mining sector remains very lucrative , with some of the world 's largest platinum reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum . The Marange diamond fields , discovered in 2006 , are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century . They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably , but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared into the pockets of army officers and ZANU - PF politicians . </P> <P> In terms of carats produced , the Marange field is one of the largest diamond producing projects in the world , estimated to produce 12 million carats in 2014 worth over $350 million . Zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of South Africa on the continent . </P> <P> Taxes and tariffs are high for private enterprises , while state enterprises are strongly subsidised . State regulation is costly to companies ; starting or closing a business is slow and costly . Government spending was predicted to reach 67 % of GDP in 2007 . </P> <P> Tourism was an important industry for the country , but has been failing in recent years . The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007 , estimating 60 % of Zimbabwe 's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation . The report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the tourist industry . </P> <P> The ICT sector of Zimbabwe has been growing at a fast pace . A report by the mobile internet browser company , Opera , in June / July 2011 has ranked Zimbabwe as Africa 's fastest growing market . </P> A market in Mbare , Harare <P> Since 1 January 2002 , the government of Zimbabwe has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen , through US legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 ( ZDERA ) . Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government . According to the United States , these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens . </P> The GDP per capita ( current ) , compared to neighbouring countries ( world average = 100 ) . <P> Zimbabwe maintained positive economic growth throughout the 1980s ( 5 % GDP growth per year ) and 1990s ( 4.3 % GDP growth per year ) . The economy declined from 2000 : 5 % decline in 2000 , 8 % in 2001 , 12 % in 2002 and 18 % in 2003 . Zimbabwe 's involvement from 1998 to 2002 in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy . From 1999 -- 2009 , Zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth with an annual GDP decrease of 6.1 % . </P> <P> The downward spiral of the economy has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000 . The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy . </P> <P> By 2005 , the purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean had dropped to the same levels in real terms as 1953 . In 2005 , the government , led by central bank governor Gideon Gono , started making overtures that white farmers could come back . There were 400 to 500 still left in the country , but much of the land that had been confiscated was no longer productive . By 2016 there were about 300 farms owned by white farmers left out of the original 4,500 . The farms left were either too remote or their owners had paid for protection or collaborated with the regime . </P> <P> In January 2007 , the government issued long term leases to some white farmers . At the same time , however , the government also continued to demand that all remaining white farmers , who were given eviction notices earlier , vacate the land or risk being arrested . Mugabe pointed to foreign governments and alleged `` sabotage '' as the cause of the fall of the Zimbabwean economy , as well as the country 's 80 % formal unemployment rate . </P> <P> Inflation rose from an annual rate of 32 % in 1998 , to an official estimated high of 11,200,000 % in August 2008 according to the country 's Central Statistical Office . This represented a state of hyperinflation , and the central bank introduced a new 100 billion dollar note . </P> <P> On 29 January 2009 , in an effort to counteract runaway inflation , acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other , more stable currencies to do business , alongside the Zimbabwe dollar . In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009 . In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as the rand ( South Africa ) , the pula ( Botswana ) , the euro , and the Pound Sterling ( UK ) . </P> <P> After the formation of the Unity Government and the adoption of several currencies instead of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 , the Zimbabwean economy rebounded . GDP grew by 8 -- 9 % a year between 2009 and 2012 . In November 2010 , the IMF described the Zimbabwean economy as `` completing its second year of buoyant economic growth '' . By 2014 , Zimbabwe had recovered to levels seen in the 1990s but between 2012 and 2016 growth faltered . </P> <P> Zimplats , the nation 's largest platinum company , has proceeded with US $500 million in expansions , and is also continuing a separate US $2 billion project , despite threats by Mugabe to nationalise the company . The pan-African investment bank IMARA released a favourable report in February 2011 on investment prospects in Zimbabwe , citing an improved revenue base and higher tax receipts . </P> <P> In late January 2013 , the Zimbabwean finance ministry reported that they had only $217 in their treasury and would apply for donations to finance the coming elections that is estimated to cost 107 million USD . </P> <P> As of October 2014 , Metallon Corporation was Zimbabwe 's largest gold miner . The group is looking to increase its production to 500,000 troy ounces per annum by 2019 . </P> <H3> Agriculture ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zimbabwe 's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange , and provided 400,000 jobs . However , the government 's land reform program badly damaged the sector , turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products . For example , between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat production fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons , maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 to 244,000 . Coffee production , once a prized export commodity came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white - owned coffee farms in 2000 , and has never recovered . </P> <P> For the past ten years , the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) has been assisting Zimbabwe 's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques , a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields . By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance , legume - based cropping and the use of organic mulch , farmers can improve infiltration , reduce evaporation and soil erosion , and build up organic soil content . </P> <P> Between 2005 and 2011 , the number of smallholders practising conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5000 to more than 150000 . Cereal yields rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different regions . </P> <H3> Tourism ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

After rising during the 1990s , ( 1.4 million tourists in 1999 ) industry figures described a 75 % fall in visitors to Zimbabwe in 2000 . By December , less than 20 % of hotel rooms had been occupied . </P> <P> In 2016 , the total contribution of tourism to Zimbabwe was $1.1 billion ( USD ) , or about 8.1 % of Zimbabwe 's GDP . It is expected to rise 1.4 % in 2017 . Employment in travel and tourism , as well as industries travel and tourism indirectly supports , was 5.2 % of national employment and is expected to rise by 1.4 % in 2017 . </P> <P> Several airlines pulled out of Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2007 . Australia 's Qantas , Germany 's Lufthansa , and Austrian Airlines were among the first to pull out and in 2007 British Airways suspended all direct flights to Harare . The country 's flagship airline Air Zimbabwe , which operated flights throughout Africa and a few destinations in Europe and Asia , ceased operations in February 2012 . As of 2017 , several major commercial airlines had resumed flights to Zimbabwe . </P> <P> Zimbabwe has several major tourist attractions . Victoria Falls on the Zambezi , which are shared with Zambia , are located in the north west of Zimbabwe . Before the economic changes , much of the tourism for these locations came to the Zimbabwe side but now Zambia is the main beneficiary . The Victoria Falls National Park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national parks in Zimbabwe , the largest of which is Hwange National Park . </P> <P> The Eastern Highlands are a series of mountainous areas near the border with Mozambique . The highest peak in Zimbabwe , Mount Nyangani at 2,593 m ( 8,507 ft ) is located here as well as the Bvumba Mountains and the Nyanga National Park . World 's View is in these mountains and it is from here that places as far away as 60 -- 70 km ( 37 -- 43 mi ) are visible and , on clear days , the town of Rusape can be seen . </P> <P> Zimbabwe is unusual in Africa in that there are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style . The most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo . Other ruins include Khami Ruins , Zimbabwe , Dhlo - Dhlo and Naletale . </P> <P> The Matobo Hills are an area of granite kopjes and wooded valleys commencing some 22 miles ( 35 km ) south of Bulawayo in southern Zimbabwe . The Hills were formed over 2,000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface , then being eroded to produce smooth `` whaleback dwalas '' and broken kopjes , strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation . Mzilikazi , founder of the Ndebele nation , gave the area its name , meaning ' Bald Heads ' . They have become famous and a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and local wildlife . Cecil Rhodes and other early white pioneers like Leander Starr Jameson are buried in these hills at a site named World 's View . </P> <H3> Water supply and sanitation ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe <P> Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe is defined by many small scale successful programs but also by a general lack of improved water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe . According to the World Health Organization in 2012 , 80 % of Zimbabweans had access to improved , i.e. clean , drinking - water sources , and only 40 % of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities . Access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas . </P> Public expenditure on education in Southern Africa as a share of GDP , 2012 or closest year . Source : UNESCO Science Report : towards 2030 ( 2015 ) <P> There are many factors which continue to determine the nature , for the foreseeable future , of water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe . </P> <P> Three major factors are the severely depressed state of the Zimbabwean economy , the reluctance of foreign aid organizations to build and finance infrastructure projects , and the political instability of the Zimbabwean state . </P> <H2> Science and Technology ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Science and technology in Zimbabwe <P> Zimbabwe has relatively well - developed national infrastructure and a long - standing tradition of promoting research and development ( R&D ) , as evidenced by the levy imposed on tobacco - growers since the 1930s to promote market research . </P> <P> The country also has a well - developed education system , with one in eleven adults holding a tertiary degree . Given the country 's solid knowledge base and abundant natural resources , Zimbabwe has the potential to figure among the countries leading growth in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 . </P> Scientific research output in terms of publications in Southern Africa , cumulative totals by field , 2008 -- 2014 . Source : UNESCO Science Report : towards 2030 ( 2015 ) , Figure 20.6 <P> To do so , however , Zimbabwe will need to correct a number of structural weaknesses . For instance , it currently lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation . Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe 's socio - economic development , universities and research institutions lack the requisite financial and human resources to conduct research and the current regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector . The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise ( medicine , engineering , etc . ) that is of growing concern . More than 22 % of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012 , compared to a 4 % average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole . In 2012 , there were 200 researchers ( head count ) employed in the public sector , one - quarter of whom were women . This is double the continental average ( 91 in 2013 ) but only one - quarter the researcher density of South Africa ( 818 per million inhabitants ) . The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe . </P> <P> Despite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and innovation policy , the Medium Term Plan 2011 -- 2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering . The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission . </P> <P> Nor does the development agenda to 2018 , the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Economic Transformation , contain any specific targets for increasing the number of scientists and engineers , or the staffing requirements for industry and other productive sectors . In addition , the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structures has led to a multiplication of research priorities and poor implementation of existing policies . </P> Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries , 2005 -- 2014 . Source : UNESCO Science Report : towards 2030 ( 2015 ) , data from Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science , Science Citation Index Expanded <P> The country 's Second Science and Technology Policy was launched in June 2012 , after being elaborated with UNESCO assistance . It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002 . The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology , information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) , space sciences , nanotechnology , indigenous knowledge systems , technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges . The Second Science and Technology Policy also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1 % of GDP to research and development , focusing at least 60 % of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30 % of their time to studying science subjects . </P> <P> In 2014 , Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals , according to Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science ( Science Citation Index Expanded ) . This placed Zimbabwe sixth out of the 15 SADC countries , behind Namibia ( 59 ) , Mauritius ( 71 ) , Botswana ( 103 ) and , above all , South Africa ( 175 ) and the Seychelles ( 364 ) . The average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 scientific publications per million inhabitants , compared to a global average of 176 per million . </P> <H2> Demographics ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Demographics of Zimbabwe <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""4""> Population in Zimbabwe </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Million </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1950 </Td> <Td> 2.7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2000 </Td> <Td> 12.2 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2016 </Td> <Td> 16.2 </Td> </Tr> </Table> A n'anga ( Traditional Healer ) of the majority ( 70 % ) Shona people , holding a kudu horn trumpet <P> Zimbabwe 's total population is 12.97 million . According to the United Nations World Health Organisation , the life expectancy for men was 56 years and the life expectancy for women was 60 years of age ( 2012 ) . An association of doctors in Zimbabwe has made calls for President Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service . The HIV infection rate in Zimbabwe was estimated to be 14 % for people aged 15 -- 49 in 2009 . UNESCO reported a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women from 26 % in 2002 to 21 % in 2004 . </P> <P> Some 85 % of Zimbabweans are Christian ; 62 % of the population attends religious services regularly . The largest Christian churches are Anglican , Roman Catholic , Seventh - day Adventist and Methodist . </P> <P> As in other African countries , Christianity may be mixed with enduring traditional beliefs . Ancestral worship is the most practised non-Christian religion , involving spiritual intercession ; the mbira dzavadzimu , which means `` voice of the ancestors '' , an instrument related to many lamellophones ubiquitous throughout Africa , is central to many ceremonial proceedings . Mwari simply means `` God the Creator '' ( musika vanhu in Shona ) . Around 1 % of the population is Muslim . </P> A group of women and children in Norton , Zimbabwe <P> Bantu - speaking ethnic groups make up 98 % of the population . The majority people , the Shona , comprise 70 % . The Ndebele are the second most populous with 20 % of the population . </P> <P> The Ndebele descended from Zulu migrations in the 19th century and the other tribes with which they intermarried . Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country over the last five years , mainly for South Africa . Other Bantu ethnic groups make up the third largest with 2 to 5 % : these are Venda , Tonga , Shangaan , Kalanga , Sotho , Ndau , Nambya , Tswana , Xhosa and Lozi . </P> <P> Minority ethnic groups include white Zimbabweans , who make up less than 1 % of the total population . White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin , but there are also Afrikaner , Greek , Portuguese , French and Dutch communities . The white population dropped from a peak of around 278,000 or 4.3 % of the population in 1975 to possibly 120,000 in 1999 , and was estimated to be no more than 50,000 in 2002 , and possibly much less . The 2012 census lists the total white population at 28,782 ( roughly 0.22 % of the population ) , one - tenth of its 1975 estimated size . Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom ( between 200,000 and 500,000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin ) , South Africa , Botswana , Zambia , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . Coloureds form 0.5 % of the population , and various Asian ethnic groups , mostly of Indian and Chinese origin , are also 0.5 % . </P> <P> According to 2012 Census report , 99.7 % of the population is of African origin .

The Bantu languages Shona and Sindebele are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe . Shona is spoken by 70 % of the population , Sindebele by 20 % . Other minority Bantu languages include Venda , Tsonga , Shangaan , Kalanga , Sotho , Ndau and Nambya . Less than 2.5 % , mainly the white and `` coloured '' ( mixed race ) minorities , consider English their native language . Shona has a rich oral tradition , which was incorporated into the first Shona novel , Feso by Solomon Mutswairo , published in 1956 . English is spoken primarily in the cities , but less so in rural areas . Radio and television news now broadcast in Shona , Sindebele and English . </P> <P> Zimbabwe has 16 official languages and under the constitution , an Act of Parliament may prescribe other languages as officially recognised languages . </P> <H3> Refugee crisis ( edit ) </H3> <P> The economic meltdown and repressive political measures in Zimbabwe have led to a flood of refugees into neighbouring countries . An estimated 3.4 million Zimbabweans , a quarter of the population , had fled abroad by mid-2007 . Some 3,000,000 of these left for South Africa and Botswana . </P> <P> Apart from the people who fled into the neighbouring countries , there are approximately 36,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) .

Protestants ( mostly followers of Pentecostal African Churches ) are around 63 % of the population . Estimates from 2005 said there were 1,145,000 Roman Catholics in Zimbabwe . This is about 9 % of the total population . The followers of ethnic religions are around 11 % . Around 1 % are Muslims , mainly from Mozambique and Malawi , 0.1 % are Hindus and 0.3 % are Baha'is . Approximately 7 % of citizens have no religious practice or are atheist . </P> <H2> Culture ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Culture of Zimbabwe <P> Zimbabwe has many different cultures which may include beliefs and ceremonies , one of them being Shona , Zimbabwe 's largest ethnic group . The Shona people have many sculptures and carvings which are made with the finest materials available . </P> <P> Zimbabwe first celebrated its independence on 18 April 1980 . Celebrations are held at either the National Sports Stadium or Rufaro Stadium in Harare . The first independence celebrations were held in 1980 at the Zimbabwe Grounds . At these celebrations doves are released to symbolise peace and fighter jets fly over and the national anthem is sung . The flame of independence is lit by the president after parades by the presidential family and members of the armed forces of Zimbabwe . The president also gives a speech to the people of Zimbabwe which is televised for those unable to attend the stadium . Zimbabwe also has a national beauty pageant , the Miss Heritage Zimbabwe contest which has been held annually ever since 2012 . </P> <H3> Arts ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Zimbabwean art See also : Music of Zimbabwe `` Reconciliation '' , a stone sculpture by Amos Supuni <P> Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery , basketry , textiles , jewellery and carving . Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood . Shona sculpture has become world - famous in recent years having found popularity in the 1940s . Most subjects of carved figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with sedimentary rocks such as soapstone , as well as harder igneous rocks such as serpentine and the rare stone verdite . Zimbabwean artefacts can be found in countries like Singapore , China and Canada . i.e. Dominic Benhura 's statue in the Singapore Botanic Gardens . </P> <P> Shona sculpture in has survived through the ages and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences . World - renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas , Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa , Tapfuma Gutsa , Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika . Internationally , Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists , particularly Black Americans , through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe . Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro - diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States . </P> <P> Several authors are well known within Zimbabwe and abroad . Charles Mungoshi is renowned in Zimbabwe for writing traditional stories in English and in Shona and his poems and books have sold well with both the black and white communities . Catherine Buckle has achieved international recognition with her two books African Tears and Beyond Tears which tell of the ordeal she went through under the 2000 Land Reform . The first Prime Minister of Rhodesia , Ian Smith , wrote two books -- The Great Betrayal and Bitter Harvest . The book The House of Hunger by Dambudzo Marechera won an award in the UK in 1979 and the Nobel Prize - winning author Doris Lessing 's first novel The Grass Is Singing , the first four volumes of The Children of Violence sequence , as well as the collection of short stories African Stories are set in Rhodesia . In 2013 NoViolet Bulawayo 's novel We Need New Names was shortlisted for the Booker Prize . The novel tells the story of the devastation and emigration caused by the brutal suppression of Zimbabwean civilians during the Gukurahundi in the early 1980s . </P> <P> Internationally famous artists include Henry Mudzengerere and Nicolas Mukomberanwa . A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast . Zimbabwean musicians like Thomas Mapfumo , Oliver Mtukudzi , the Bhundu Boys ; Alick Macheso and Audius Mtawarira have achieved international recognition . Among members of the white minority community , Theatre has a large following , with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe 's urban areas . </P> <H3> Cuisine ( edit ) </H3> A meal of sadza ( right ) , greens , and goat offal . The goat 's small intestines are wrapped around small pieces of large intestines before cooking . <P> Like in many African countries , the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods . `` Mealie meal '' , also known as cornmeal , is used to prepare sadza or isitshwala , as well as porridge known as bota or ilambazi . Sadza is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste / porridge . After the paste has been cooking for several minutes , more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste . </P> <P> This is usually eaten as lunch or dinner , usually with sides such as gravy , vegetables ( spinach , chomolia , or spring greens / collard greens ) , beans , and meat ( stewed , grilled , roasted , or sundried ) . Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk ( sour milk ) , commonly known as `` lacto '' ( mukaka wakakora ) , or dried Tanganyika sardine , known locally as kapenta or matemba . Bota is a thinner porridge , cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter , milk , butter , or jam . Bota is usually eaten for breakfast . </P> <P> Graduations , weddings , and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow , which will be barbecued or roasted by the family . </P> Raw boerewors <P> Even though the Afrikaners are a small group ( 10 % ) within the white minority group , Afrikaner recipes are popular . Biltong , a type of jerky , is a popular snack , prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade . Boerewors is served with sadza . It is a long sausage , often well - spiced , composed of beef rather than pork , and barbecued . As Zimbabwe was a British colony , some people there have adopted some colonial - era English eating habits . For example , most people will have porridge in the morning , as well as 10 o'clock tea ( midday tea ) . They will have lunch , often leftovers from the night before , freshly cooked sadza , or sandwiches ( which is more common in the cities ) . After lunch , there is usually 4 o'clock tea ( afternoon tea ) , which is served before dinner . It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner . </P> <P> Rice , pasta , and potato - based foods ( french fries and mashed potato ) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine . A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter , which is taken with thick gravy , mixed vegetables and meat . A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu , boiled and sundried maize , black - eyed peas known as nyemba , and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura . Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually . One can also find local snacks , such as maputi ( roasted / popped maize kernels similar to popcorn ) , roasted and salted peanuts , sugar cane , sweet potato , pumpkin , and indigenous fruits , such as horned melon , gaka , adansonia , mawuyu , uapaca kirkiana , mazhanje ( sugar plum ) , and many others . </P> <H3> Sports ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Sport in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe women 's national football team at the 2016 Olympic Games <P> Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe . The Warriors have qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations three times ( 2004 , 2006 , 2017 ) , and won the Southern Africa championship on four occasions ( 2000 , 2003 , 2005 , 2009 ) and the Eastern Africa cup once ( 1985 ) . </P> <P> Rugby union is a significant sport in Zimbabwe . The national side have represented the country at 2 Rugby World Cup tournaments in 1987 and 1991 . The team are currently ranked 26 in the world by World Rugby . </P> <P> Cricket also has a following among the white minority . It is one of ten Test cricket playing nations and a ICC full member as well . Notable cricket players from Zimbabwe include Andy Flower , Heath Streak and Brendan Taylor . </P> <P> Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals , one in field hockey with the women 's team at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , and seven by swimmer Kirsty Coventry , three at the 2004 Summer Olympics and four at the 2008 Summer Olympics . </P> <P> Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All - Africa Games in swimming with Kirsty Coventry obtaining 11 gold medals in the different competitions . Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis , most notably with the Black family , which comprises Wayne Black , Byron Black and Cara Black . Zimbabwe has also done well in golf . The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has ever done in the 24 - year history of the ranking . </P> <P> Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball , volleyball , netball , and water polo , as well as squash , motorsport , martial arts , chess , cycling , polocrosse , kayaking and horse racing . However , most of these sports do not have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level . </P> <P> Zimbabwean professional rugby league players currently playing overseas are Masimbaashe Motongo and Judah Mazive . Former players include now SANZAAR CEO Andy Marinos who made an appearance for South Africa at the Super League World Nines and featured for the Sydney Bulldogs as well as Zimbabwe - born former Scotland rugby union international Scott Gray , who spent time at the Brisbane Broncos . </P> <H3> Media ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Media of Zimbabwe <P> The media of Zimbabwe is now once again diverse , having come under tight restriction between 2002 and 2008 by the government during the growing economic and political crisis in the country . The Zimbabwean constitution promises freedom of the media and expression . Since the appointment of a new media and information minister in 2013 the media is currently facing less political interference and the supreme court has ruled some sections of the strict media laws as unconstitutional . In July 2009 the BBC and CNN were able to resume operations and report legally and openly from Zimbabwe . CNN welcomed the move . The Zimbabwe Ministry of Media , Information and Publicity stated that , `` the Zimbabwe government never banned the BBC from carrying out lawful activities inside Zimbabwe '' . The BBC also welcomed the move saying , `` we 're pleased at being able to operate openly in Zimbabwe once again '' . </P> <P> In 2010 the Zimbabwe Media Commission was established by the inclusive , power - sharing government . In May 2010 the Commission licensed three new privately owned newspapers , including the previously banned Daily News , for publication . Reporters Without Borders described the decisions as a `` major advance '' . In June 2010 NewsDay became the first independent daily newspaper to be published in Zimbabwe in seven years . </P> <P> ZBC 's monopoly in the broadcasting sector was ended with the licensing of two private radio stations in 2012 . </P> <P> Since the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act ( AIPPA ) was passed , a number of privately owned news outlets were shut down by the government , including Daily News whose managing director Wilf Mbanga went on to form the influential The Zimbabwean . As a result , many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by exiled Zimbabweans . Because the internet is currently unrestricted , many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists . Reporters Without Borders claims the media environment in Zimbabwe involves `` surveillance , threats , imprisonment , censorship , blackmail , abuse of power and denial of justice are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news . '' The main published newspapers are The Herald and The Chronicle which are printed in Harare and Bulawayo respectively . The heavy - handedness on the media has progressively relaxed since 2009 . </P> <P> In its 2008 report , Reporters Without Borders ranked the Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173 . The government also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe , including the CBC , Sky News , Channel 4 , American Broadcasting Company , Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) , and Fox News . News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country . </P> <H3> Scouting ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Scout Association of Zimbabwe Baden - Powell 's drawing of Chief of Scouts Burnham , Matobo Hills , 1896 <P> It was in the Matabeleland region in Zimbabwe that , during the Second Matabele War , Robert Baden - Powell , the founder of Scouting , and Frederick Russell Burnham , the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army , first met and began their lifelong friendship . In mid-June 1896 , during a scouting patrol in the Matobo Hills , Burnham began teaching Baden - Powell woodcraft . Baden - Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men , rich in exploration , tracking , fieldcraft , and self - reliance . It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden - Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham . </P> <P> Scouting in the former Rhodesia and Nyasaland started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered . Scouting grew quickly and in 1924 Rhodesia and Nyasaland sent a large contingent to the second World Scout Jamboree in Ermelunden , Denmark . In 1959 , Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at Ruwa . In 2009 , Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at Gordon Park , a Scout campground and training area , as part of these celebrations . </P> <P> Besides scouting , there are also leadership , life skills and general knowledge courses and training experiences mainly for school children ranging from pre-school to final year high school students and some times those beyond High school . These courses and outings are held at , for example , Lasting Impressions ( Lasting Impressions ~ Zimbabwe on YouTube ) , Far and Wide Zimbabwe ( Far and wide . ) and Chimanimani Outward Bound ( Outwardbound Zimbabwe at the Wayback Machine ( archived 16 June 2007 ) ) . </P> <H3> National Symbols ( edit ) </H3> Traditional Zimbabwe Bird design <P> The stone - carved Zimbabwe Bird appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia , as well as on banknotes and coins ( first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar ) . It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle . </P> <P> The famous soapstone bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe , built , it is believed , sometime between the 13th and 16th centuries by ancestors of the Shona . The ruins , which gave their name to modern Zimbabwe , cover some 1,800 acres ( 7.3 km ) and are the largest ancient stone construction in Zimbabwe . </P> <P> Balancing Rocks are geological formations all over Zimbabwe . The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports . They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to weathering , as softer rocks surrounding them erode away . They are often remarked on and have been depicted on both the banknotes of Zimbabwe and the Rhodesian dollar banknotes . The ones found on the current notes of Zimbabwe , named the Banknote Rocks , are located in Epworth , approximately 9 miles ( 14 km ) south east of Harare . There are many different formations of the rocks , incorporating single and paired columns of 3 or more rocks . These formations are a feature of south and east tropical Africa from northern South Africa northwards to Sudan . The most notable formations in Zimbabwe are located in the Matobo National Park in Matabeleland . </P> <P> The National Anthem of Zimbabwe is `` Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe '' ( Shona : `` Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe '' ; Northern Ndebele : `` Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe '' ) . It was introduced in March 1994 after a nationwide competition to replace `` Ishe Komborera Africa '' as a distinctly Zimbabwean song . The winning entry was a song written by Professor Solomon Mutswairo and composed by Fred Changundega . It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Zimbabwe . </P> <H2> Health ( edit ) </H2> See also : HIV / AIDS in Zimbabwe and Zimbabwean cholera outbreak Map showing the spread of cholera in and around Zimbabwe put together from several sources . <P> At independence , the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority . The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage , access to health care , and contraceptive prevalence rate . Zimbabwe was thus considered internationally to have an achieved a good record of health development . </P> <P> Zimbabwe suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases ( such as plague in 1994 ) . The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s , the impact of the HIV / AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000 . In 2006 , Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure -- 44 for men and 43 for women , down from 60 in 1990 , but recovered to 60 in 2015 . The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . Infant mortality rose from 6 % in the late 1990s to 12.3 % by 2004 . By 2016 HIV / AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 13.5 % compared to 40 % in 1998 . </P> <P> The health system has more or less collapsed . At the end of November 2008 , some operations at three of Zimbabwe 's four major referral hospitals had shut down , along with the Zimbabwe Medical School , and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working . Due to hyperinflation , those hospitals still open were not able to obtain basic drugs and medicines . The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge . </P> <P> In August 2008 large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing cholera epidemic . By December 2008 more than 10,000 people had been infected in all but one of Zimbabwe 's provinces and the outbreak had spread to Botswana , Mozambique , South Africa and Zambia . On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid . </P> <P> By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that 4,011 people had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008 , and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89,018 . In Harare , the city council offered free graves to cholera victims . There had been signs that the disease is abating , with cholera infections down by about 50 % to around 4,000 cases a week . </P> <P> The 2014 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe was 614 compared to 960 in 2010 -- 11 and 232 in 1990 . The under 5 mortality rate , per 1,000 births was 75 in 2014 ( 94 in 2009 ) . The number of midwives per 1,000 live births was unavailable in 2016 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 42 . </P> <H2> Education ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Education in Zimbabwe St George 's College , Harare was established in 1896 by a French Jesuit <P> Due to large investments in education since independence , Zimbabwe has the highest adult literacy rate in Africa which in 2013 was 90.70 % . This is lower than the 92 % recorded in 2010 by the United Nations Development Programme and the 97.0 % recorded in the 2002 census , while still substantially higher than 80.4 % recorded in the 1992 census . </P> <P> The education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe 's children have not progressed beyond primary school . </P> <P> The wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government - run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidized by the government . School education was made free in 1980 , but since 1988 , the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980 . The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe . </P> <P> Zimbabwe 's education system consists of 2 years of pre-school , 7 years of primary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad . The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December , with three terms , broken up by one month holidays , with a total of 40 weeks of school per year . National examinations are written during the third term in November , with `` O '' level and `` A '' level subjects also offered in June . </P> <P> There are seven public ( Government ) universities as well as four church - related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited . The University of Zimbabwe , the first and largest , was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant . Notable alumni from Zimbabwean universities include Welshman Ncube ; Peter Moyo ( of Amabhubesi ) ; Tendai Biti , Chenjerai Hove , Zimbabwean poet , novelist and essayist ; and Arthur Mutambara . Many of the current politicians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from universities in USA or other universities abroad . </P> <P> National University of Science and Technology ( NUST ) is the second largest public research university in Zimbabwe located in Bulawayo . It was established in 1991 . The National University of Science and Technology strives to become a flourishing and reputable institution not only in Zimbabwe and in Southern Africa but also among the international fraternity of Universities . Its guidance , cultural values is the encouragement of all its members and society of those attitudes of fair mindedness , understanding , tolerance and respect for people and views which are essential for the attainment and maintenance of justice , peace and harmony at all times . </P> <P> Africa University is a United Methodist related university institution located in Manicaland which attracts students from at least 36 African countries . The institution has been growing steadily and has steady study material and learning facilities . The highest professional board for accountants is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe ( ICAZ ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa , Canada , the UK and Australia . A qualified Chartered Accountant from Zimbabwe is also a member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a conversion paper . In addition , Zimbabwean - trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States . The Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers ( ZIE ) is the highest professional board for engineers . </P> <P> Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay , students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury . Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe 's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Zimbabwe portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Education in Zimbabwe </Li> <Li> Index of Zimbabwe - related articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Zimbabwe </Li> </Ul> <H2> Source ( edit ) </H2> <P> This article incorporates text from a free content work .

An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . </P> <P> In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the `` are '' was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( `` hecto - '' + `` are '' ) was thus 100 `` ares '' or ​ ⁄ km . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units , mentioned in Section 4.1 of the SI Brochure as a unit whose use is `` expected to continue indefinitely '' . </P> <Table> Comparison of area units <Tr> <Th> Unit </Th> <Th> SI </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 ca </Td> <Td> 1 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 a </Td> <Td> 100 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 ha </Td> <Td> 10,000 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 100 ha </Td> <Td> 1,000,000 m 1 km </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""2""> non-SI comparisons </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> non-SI </Th> <Th> metric </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 0.3861 sq mi </Td> <Td> 1 km </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.471 acre </Td> <Td> 1 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 107,639 sq ft </Td> <Td> 1 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 sq mi </Td> <Td> 259.0 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 acre </Td> <Td> 0.4047 ha </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Units <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Centiare </Li> <Li> 2.2 Deciare </Li> <Li> 2.3 Are </Li> <Li> 2.4 Decare </Li> <Li> 2.5 Hectare </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Conversions </Li> <Li> 4 Visualising a hectare <Ul> <Li> 4.1 International rugby pitch </Li> <Li> 4.2 Statue of Liberty </Li> <Li> 4.3 Interior of all - weather athletics track </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The metric system of measurement was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the French Revolutionary government . The law of 18 Germinal , Year III ( 7 April 1795 ) defined five units of measure : </P> <Ul> <Li> The metre for length </Li> <Li> The are ( 100 m ) for area ( of land ) </Li> <Li> The stère ( 1 m ) for volume of stacked firewood </Li> <Li> The litre ( 1 dm ) for volumes of liquid </Li> <Li> The gram for mass </Li> </Ul> <P> Although the law defined the length of the metre , there was no practical way of accurately measuring the metre ( and hence the are ) until 1799 when the first standard metre was manufactured and adopted . </P> <P> The standard metre remained in the custody of successive French governments until 1875 when , under the Convention of the Metre , its supervision passed into international control under the auspices of the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) . At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889 when a new standard metre , manufactured by Johnson Matthey & Co of London was adopted , the are and hectare were automatically redefined . </P> <P> In 1960 , when the metric system was updated as the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are did not receive international recognition . The International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) makes no mention of the are in the current ( 2006 ) definition of the SI , but classifies the hectare as a `` Non-SI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units '' </P> <P> In 1972 , the European Economic Community ( EEC ) passed directive 71 / 354 / EEC , which catalogued the units of measure that might be used within the Community . The units that were catalogued replicated the recommendations of the CGPM , supplemented by a few other units including the are ( and implicitly the hectare ) whose use was limited to the measurement of land . </P> <P> Many UK farmers , especially older ones , still use the acre for everyday calculations , and convert to hectares only for official ( especially European Union ) paperwork . Farm fields can have very long histories which are resistant to change , with names such as `` the six acre field '' stretching back hundreds of years and across generations of family farmers . Some younger agricultural workers are now beginning to think in hectares as their `` first language '' , though this is more typical of professional consultants and managers than of traditional farming and land - owning families , and in some circles may be viewed as a social class indicator . </P> <H2> Units ( edit ) </H2> Definition of a hectare and of an are . <P> The names centiare , deciare , decare and hectare are derived by adding the standard metric prefixes to the original base unit of area , the are . </P> <H3> Centiare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The centiare is one square metre . </P> <H3> Deciare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The deciare is ten square metres . </P> <H3> Are ( edit ) </H3> <P> The are ( / ɑːr / or / ɛər / ) is a unit of area , equal to 100 square metres ( 10 m × 10 m ) , used for measuring land area . It was defined by older forms of the metric system , but is now outside the modern International System of Units ( SI ) . It is still commonly used in colloquial speech to measure real estate , in particular in Indonesia , India , and in various European countries . </P> <P> In Russian and other languages of the former Soviet Union , the are is called sotka ( Russian : сотка : ' a hundred ' , i.e. 100 m ) . It is used to describe the size of suburban dacha or allotment garden plots or small city parks where the hectare would be too large . </P> <P> Etymologically , the word are finds its roots in the Talmudic Aramaic word ארעא ( araa ) , meaning `` land '' . </P> <H3> Decare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The decare ( / ˈdɛkɑːr , - ɛər / ) is derived from deca and are , and is equal to 10 ares or 1000 square metres . It is used in Norway and in the former Ottoman areas of the Middle East and the Balkans ( Bulgaria ) as a measure of land area . Instead of the name `` decare '' , the names of traditional land measures are usually used , redefined as one decare : </P> <Ul> <Li> Stremma in Greece </Li> <Li> Dunam , dunum , donum , or dönüm in Israel , Palestine , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Turkey </Li> <Li> Mål is sometimes used for decare in Norway , from the old measure of about the same area . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Hectare ( edit ) </H3> Trafalgar Square has an area of about one hectare . <P> The hectare ( / ˈhɛktɛər , - tɑːr / ) , although not a unit of SI , is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use within the SI . In practice the hectare is fully derived from the SI , being equivalent to a square hectometre . It is widely used throughout the world for the measurement of large areas of land , and it is the legal unit of measure in domains concerned with land ownership , planning , and management , including law ( land deeds ) , agriculture , forestry , and town planning throughout the European Union . The United Kingdom , United States , Burma , and to some extent Canada use the acre instead . </P> <P> Some countries that underwent a general conversion from traditional measurements to metric measurements ( e.g. Canada ) required a resurvey when units of measure in legal descriptions relating to land were converted to metric units . Others , such as South Africa , published conversion factors which were to be used particularly `` when preparing consolidation diagrams by compilation '' . </P> <P> In many countries , metrication redefined or clarified existing measures in terms of metric units .

On 30 January 1969 , the band , with keyboardist Billy Preston , surprised a central London office and fashion district with an impromptu concert from the roof of the headquarters of the band 's multimedia corporation Apple Corps at 3 Savile Row . In a 42 - minute set , the Beatles were heard playing nine takes of five songs before the Metropolitan Police Service asked them to reduce the volume . Footage from the performance was later used in the 1970 documentary film Let It Be . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Set list </Li> <Li> 3 Legacy </Li> <Li> 4 Personnel </Li> <Li> 5 Citations </Li> <Li> 6 Sources </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although the concert was unannounced , the Beatles had planned on performing live during their Get Back sessions earlier in January . It is uncertain who had the idea for a rooftop concert , but the suggestion was conceived just days before the actual event . George Harrison brought in keyboardist Billy Preston as an additional musician , in the hope that a talented outside observer would encourage the band to be tight and focused . Ringo Starr remembered : </P> <P> `` There was a plan to play live somewhere . We were wondering where we could go -- ' Oh , the Palladium or the Sahara ' . But we would have had to take all the stuff , so we decided , ' Let 's get up on the roof ' '' . </P> <P> The audio was recorded onto two eight - track recorders in the basement of Apple by engineer Alan Parsons , and film director Michael Lindsay - Hogg brought in a camera crew to capture several angles of the performance -- including reactions from people on the street . </P> <P> When the Beatles first started playing , there was some confusion from spectators watching five stories below , many of whom were on their lunch break . As the news of the event spread , crowds of onlookers began to congregate in the streets and on the roofs of local buildings . While most responded positively to the concert , the Metropolitan Police Service grew concerned about noise and traffic issues . Apple employees initially refused to let police inside , ultimately reconsidering when threatened with arrest . </P> <P> As police ascended to the roof , the Beatles realised that the concert would eventually be shut down , but continued to play for several more minutes . Paul McCartney improvised the lyrics of his song `` Get Back '' to reflect the situation , `` You 've been playing on the roofs again , and you know your Momma does n't like it , she 's gon na have you arrested ! '' The concert came to an end with the conclusion of `` Get Back '' , with John Lennon saying , `` I 'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we 've passed the audition '' . </P> <H2> Set list ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rooftop concert consisted of nine takes of five Beatles songs , including : </P> <Ul> <Li> `` Get Back '' ( three takes ) </Li> <Li> `` Do n't Let Me Down '' ( two takes ) </Li> <Li> `` I 've Got a Feeling '' ( two takes ) </Li> <Li> `` One After 909 '' ( one take ) </Li> <Li> `` Dig a Pony '' ( one take ) </Li> </Ul> <P> The first performance of `` I 've Got a Feeling '' , and the recordings of `` One After 909 '' , and `` Dig a Pony '' were later used for the album Let It Be . In 1996 , a `` rooftop '' version of `` Get Back '' , which was the last song of the Beatles ' final live performance , was included in Anthology 3 . An edit of the two takes of `` Do n't Let Me Down '' was included on Let It Be ... Naked . There was also a brief jam of `` I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) '' while the cameramen changed film . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

They did record one more album , Abbey Road , but by September 1969 the Beatles had unofficially disbanded . Several of the rooftop performances , particularly that of `` Dig a Pony '' , showed the Beatles once again in top form , if only temporarily . Fans believed the rooftop concert might have been a try - out for a return to live performances and touring . </P> <P> The Rutles ' `` Get Up and Go '' sequence in the film All You Need Is Cash mimics the footage of the rooftop concert , and uses similar camera angles . In January 2009 , tribute band the Bootleg Beatles attempted to stage a 40th anniversary concert in the same location , but were refused permission by Westminster City Council due to licensing problems . </P> <P> In The Simpsons fifth season episode `` Homer 's Barbershop Quartet '' , the Be Sharps ( Homer , Apu , Barney and Principal Skinner ) perform a rendition of one of their previous hits on a rooftop . George Harrison , who guest - starred in the episode , is shown saying dismissively `` It 's been done ! '' As the song ends and the credits begin , Homer repeats John Lennon 's phrase about passing the audition and everyone laughs , including Barney until he says , `` I do n't get it . '' </P> <P> In the 2007 film Across The Universe , a musical made up entirely of Beatles ' music , Sadie 's band performs a rooftop concert in New York City which mimics the original . It is interrupted and closed down by the New York Police Department . </P> <P> U2 also referenced the concert in their video for `` Where the Streets Have No Name '' , which featured a similar rooftop concert in Los Angeles . </P> <P> McCartney played a surprise mini-concert in midtown Manhattan on 15 July 2009 from the top of the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater , where he was recording a performance for Late Show with David Letterman . News of the event spread via Twitter and word of mouth , and nearby street corners were closed off to accommodate fans for the set , which duplicated the original Beatles gig . </P> <H2> Personnel ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> John Lennon -- vocals , guitar </Li> <Li> Paul McCartney -- vocals , bass guitar </Li> <Li> George Harrison -- vocals , guitar </Li> <Li> Ringo Starr -- drums </Li> <Li> Billy Preston -- electric piano </Li> </Ul> <H2> Citations ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` 20 Things You Need To Know About The Beatles ' Rooftop Concert '' . mojo4music.com. 30 January 2014 .

He is a member of the center - left Citizens ' Action Party ( PAC ) . Solís led the field in the 2014 presidential election , and he was effectively handed the presidency after the runner - up in the first round , San José mayor Johnny Araya Monge , ceased active campaigning . Solís has a long academic and political career , culminating in his election as the first President of Costa Rica to be a member of the PAC . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life , education , and academic career </Li> <Li> 2 Political beginnings </Li> <Li> 3 2014 presidential campaign </Li> <Li> 4 Presidency <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Economic issues <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Liquidity problems </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Political , economic , and social philosophy </Li> <Li> 6 Personal life </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life , education , and academic career ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solís was born in San José , Costa Rica , to Vivienne Rivera Allen , an educator , and Freddy Solís Avendaño , an uneducated shoemaker . Both his parents lived in Turrialba , and as such many residents consider him Turrialban . His family has Afro - Caribbean and Chinese roots , coming from Jamaica to Costa Rica in the early 1900s . Solís grew up in San Pedro de Montes de Oca and Curridabat , neighborhoods of San José . He attended Methodist High School in San José , where he was president of the student body , before studying history at the University of Costa Rica , where he earned a degree with academic honors in 1979 . He earned a master 's degree in Latin American Studies at Tulane University in New Orleans . </P> <P> Solís has held various academic and consulting positions . Between 1981 and 1987 , he was an associate professor at the University of Costa Rica . In addition , he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Michigan from 1983 to 1985 . During this time , Solís worked with the Arias administration and eventually became director of the Center for Peace and Reconciliation ( CPR for its Spanish initials ) . From 1992 to 1995 , Solís worked with the Academic Council of the United Nations System . Starting in 1999 , Solís worked for Florida International University as coordinator in the Center for the Administration of Justice and as a researcher for the Latin American and Caribbean Center , where he analyzed political and social events in Latin America . </P> <P> A writer and editorial writer , Solís has published numerous essays and books about national and international affairs . In the 1990s , he wrote for La República , a daily newspaper based in San José . His writing has been published by Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica , Frontera Norte , Espacios and Global Governance . His writing has focused on civil society , international relations , and trade . </P> <H2> Political beginnings ( edit ) </H2> <P> While still at UCR , Solís joined the National Liberation Party ( PLN for its Spanish initials ) in 1977 . Solís was an adviser to Óscar Arias in the Foreign Ministry , working on the Esquipulas Peace Agreement for which Arias would later win a Nobel Peace Prize . Solís served as Director of International Relations for the PLN . During José María Figueres Olsen 's time in office , Solís was ambassador of Central American Affairs . </P> <P> In 2002 , Solís followed Rolando González Ulloa as General Secretary of the PLN , a position he resigned from the following year , citing his disappointment with the Alcatel - Lucent bribery scandal that many PLN leaders were involved in . In 2005 , he denounced the PLN for irregularities and corruption during party elections , along with a host of former PLN members . Solís went as far as to call the PLN leadership `` Napoleonic '' and `` anti-democratic '' . He officially renounced his affiliation with the party and returned to academics . </P> <P> After the 2006 election , Solís ' name began to come up in PAC circles , particularly at meetings of the `` ungroup , '' an informal gathering of PAC officials , led by former deputy and former Vice President of the National University of Costa Rica Alberto Salom Echeverría . Ottón Solís , one of PAC 's founders and three - time presidential candidate , suggested that Luis Guillermo Solís run as a vice presidential candidate in 2010 . Luis Guillermo Solis rejected the offer because he was working for the General Secretariat of Ibero - America ( SEGIB for its Spanish initials ) , and employees of SEGIB were not allowed to participate in elections . </P> <P> In 2009 , Luis Guillermo Solís began his official affiliation with PAC . He began attending meetings of the `` ungroup '' in 2010 . Within the party , PAC leader María Eugenia Venegas recognized Solís ' potential and pushed for him to be elevated within the party . Solís undertook several trips around the country to meet with national and provincial PAC leaders . </P> <H2> 2014 presidential campaign ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solís announced his candidacy for president on 27 November 2012 . In the PAC 's primary , he ran against Epsy Campbell Barr , Juan Carlos Mendoza García , and Ronald Solís Bolaños , winning with 35 percent of the vote , only 110 votes more than Juan Carlos Mendoza García . </P> <P> In October 2013 , he chose Helio Fallas and Ana Helena Chacón Echeverría as his Vice-Presidential running mates . Among his aims , Solís claimed he would clean up corruption , create major investments in infrastructure , and shore up Costa Rica 's universal health care and social security system . He also promised to continue initiatives to keep Costa Rica environmentally friendly . He said that he would `` put the brakes '' on new free trade agreements and would begin correctly administrating current free trade agreements . As such , Solís received a tremendous amount of political support from the country 's trade unions . </P> <P> On 2 February 2014 , Solís won the most votes in the election with 30.95 percent . PLN candidate Johnny Araya came second with 29.95 percent of the vote . Most of Solís ' support came from the Central Valley provinces of San José , Alajuela , Heredia and Cartago . </P> PAC supporters wave their traditional colors to celebrate Luis Guillermo Solís ' victory on 6 April 2014 <P> Because no candidate exceeded 40 percent of the vote , a runoff was scheduled for 6 April , as required by the constitution . However , on 5 March , Araya announced that he would abandon his campaign after polls showed him far behind Solís ; one poll showed him losing by over 43 percent . However , under Costa Rican law the runoff still had to take place , and Solís won with over 77 percent of the vote , the largest margin ever recorded for a free election in Costa Rica . Unlike the first round , Solís earned a majority in every province , including Puntarenas , Limón , and Guanacaste . When he took office on 8 May , he was the first president in 66 years not to come from the PLN or what is now the PUSC . </P> <P> Immediately after the election , Solís thanked Costa Rican voters . He received congratulatory notes from world leaders , including US Secretary of State John Kerry , Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa , Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto , Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , Bolivian President Evo Morales , and the spokesperson from the French Ministry of International Affairs . For his part , Araya congratulated Solís on his victory , calling for national unity . </P> <H2> Presidency ( edit ) </H2> Solís speaking in 2014 <P> A little over a week before taking office , in April 2014 , Solís announced the creation of his cabinet . His cabinet consists of mostly PAC members or non-aligned citizens . However , two PUSC members were also added : María del Rocío Sáenz , Abel Pacheco 's former health minister , heads the Costa Rican Social Security System ( Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social ) . Delia Villalobos , another former health minister , heads the Social Protection Council ( Consejo de Seguridad ) . </P> <P> Solís took office on 8 May 2014 , amid festive fanfare . Delegations from more than 80 countries attended his inauguration at La Sabana Metropolitan Park , including Prince Felipe de Borbón of Spain , Evo Morales of Bolivia , Rafael Correa of Ecuador , and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States , José Miguel Insulza . Solís said , in Costa Rican vernacular , that he is taking over a `` weed farm '' ( finca encharralada ) , pointing out growing income inequality and poverty , as well as a national teachers ' strike . </P> <H3> Economic issues ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2014 , President Solís presented a budget with an increase in spending of 19 % for 2015 , an increase of 0.5 % for 2016 and an increase of 12 % for 2017 . When the 2017 budget was finally proposed , it totaled US $15.9 billion . Debt payments account for one - third of that amount . Of greater concern is the fact that a full 46 % of the budget will require financing , a step that will increase the debt owed to foreign entities . </P> <P> The country 's credit rating was reduced by Moody 's Investors Service in early 2017 to Ba2 from Ba1 , with a negative outlook on the rating . The agency particularly cited the `` rising government debt burden and persistently high fiscal deficit , which was 5.2 % of GDP in 2016 '' . Moody 's was also concerned about the `` lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the fiscal deficit ( which ) will result in further pressure on the government 's debt ratios '' . In late July 2017 , the Costa Rica Central Bank estimated the budget deficit at 6.1 percent of the country 's GDP . </P> <P> A 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt must be a very high priority for the government . Other fiscal reforms were also recommended to moderate the budget deficit . </P> Liquidity problems ( edit ) <P> In early August 2017 , the President promised admitted that the country was facing a `` liquidity crisis '' and promised that a higher VAT tax and higher income tax rates were being considered by his government . Such steps are essential , Solís told the nation , because it was facing difficulties in paying its obligations and guaranteeing the provision of services . '' `` Despite all the public calls and efforts we have made since the start of my administration to contain spending and increase revenues , there is still a gap that we must close with fresh resources , '' he said . The crisis was occurring in spite of growth , low inflation and continued moderate interest rates , Solís concluded . </P> <P> He explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt first , then salaries , and then pensions . The subsequent priorities include transfers to institutions `` according to their social urgency . '' All other payments will be made only if funds are available . </P> <H2> Political , economic , and social philosophy ( edit ) </H2> The past generated two different economies : one very dynamic , modern and generally oriented toward international markets , with limited possibilities for new sources of employment , and the other , traditional , which created many jobs with low pay where small and medium - sized businesses concentrated . Luis Guillermo Solís , Plan Rescate , 2014 - 2018 <P> Like most members of PAC , Solís identifies himself as a progressivist . His Plan Rescate , or Rescue Plan , outlines his political beliefs . This plan focused on three central issues : anti-corruption , economic growth , and reducing income inequality . </P> <P> Solís claims that economic neoliberalism has created too much income inequality for Costa Rica . Past governments have avoided collecting taxes on large companies and high - income earners , leading to budget deficits which Solís claims his administration will fix through better enforcement . Banks should not encourage exports at the expense of income growth among the poor , according to Solís . He believes that economic liberalization has generally harmed women more than men because they have traditionally had less access to higher - income jobs . Part of that liberalization , he claims , included ignoring the financial and growth needs of the agricultural industry . </P> <P> Solís supports environmental protections , which he believes Costa Rica has forgotten . As such , Solís believes that water must be safeguarded from private development and mismanagement , something that has caused water shortages in many of the country 's municipalities . Solís claims that he will prosecute violators of the Water Resources Management Bill . </P> <P> In addition , Solís supports increased rights for rights for lesbians , gays , bisexuals , and transsexuals . In May 2014 , he ordered that a rainbow flag be flown over the Presidential House as a show of solidarity with gays on International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia . </P> <P> Solís is a Catholic . As a presidential candidate , he visited the basilica of Our Lady of Angels , home to the Costa Rican patron saint La Negrita , a traditional pilgrimage for many Costa Ricans and tourists . He supports the separation of church and state despite Catholicism being the country 's official religion . With regard to ethical issues , he also supports civil unions , and in - vitro fertilization . </P> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solis has ten children from his previous marriage to his first wife , Nancy Olive Worsfold Richards ( 1987 -- 2006 ) : Monica , Cristina , Beatriz , Charlie , Carly , Jennifer , John , Carlos , Diego and Ignacio . </P> <P> Solís is not married to Mercedes Peñas Domingo , but she is altogether considered the First Lady of Costa Rica . He and Peñas , who began dating in 2006 , have one daughter , Inés . Peñas said that she hopes to be active as an adviser to Solís , who called her `` Jiminy Cricket . '' Saying that some of her duties as First Lady are machista , she will nevertheless greet dignitaries and perform other obligations . In addition to public service and academics , Solís enjoys farming . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Romo , Jose Luis ( 2015 - 03 - 15 ) . `` Mercedes Peñas , la primera dama española y atípica de Costa Rica '' .

Produced first by Saban Entertainment , later by BVS Entertainment , and today by SCG Power Rangers , the television series takes much of its footage from the Japanese tokusatsu Super Sentai , produced by Toei Company . The first Power Rangers entry , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , debuted on August 28 , 1993 , and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s , during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai . As of 2001 , the media franchise has generated over $6 billion in retail sales worldwide . </P> <P> Despite initial criticism that its action violence targeted child audiences , the franchise has continued , and as of 2017 the show consists of 24 television seasons of 20 different themed series and three theatrical films released in 1995 , 1997 and 2017 . In 2010 , Haim Saban , creator of the series , regained ownership of the franchise after seven years under The Walt Disney Company . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Premise </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Adapting the Super Sentai series </Li> <Li> 2.2 Broadcast history </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Television series <Ul> <Li> 3.1 The Saban Era </Li> <Li> 3.2 The Disney Era </Li> <Li> 3.3 The Neo-Saban Era </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Feature films </Li> <Li> 5 Distribution <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Home media </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Broadcast </Li> <Li> 7 Video games </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Premise </H2> Further information : List of Power Rangers characters and List of Power Rangers villains <P> Since Power Rangers derives most of its footage from the Super Sentai series , it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series . Each series revolves around a team of youths recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into the eponymous Power Rangers , able to utilize special powers and pilot immense assault machines , called Zords , to overcome the periodic antagonists . In the original series Mighty Morphin , the wizard Zordon recruits `` teenagers with attitude '' against Rita Repulsa . </P> <P> When `` morphed , '' the rangers become powerful superheroes wearing color - coded skin - tight spandex suits and helmets with opaque visors ; identical except in individual rangers ' color and helmet design . Morphed Rangers generally possess enhanced strength , durability , agility and combat prowess . Some possess superhuman or psychic abilities such as super-speed , element manipulation , extra-sensory perception or invisibility . In addition , each individual ranger has a unique weapon , as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting . When enemies grow to incredible size ( as nearly all do ) , Rangers utilize individual Zords that combine into a larger Megazord . </P> <P> Rangers teams operate in teams of five or three , with more Rangers joining the team later . Each team of Rangers , with a few exceptions , obeys a general set of conventions , outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series : Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight ( unless the enemy does so ) , nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public . The penalty for disobeying these rules , in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , is the loss of their power . </P> <P> As in Super Sentai , the color palette of each Power Rangers team changes every series . Only Red and Blue appear in every Ranger team , while a Yellow Ranger has been present in every season except Power Rangers Dino Charge . Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series . A Rangers ' color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series : civilian clothing often matches Ranger color . </P> <H2> History </H2> <H3> Adapting the Super Sentai series </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( October 2009 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Production of Power Rangers episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original Super Sentai source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards . Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage , Power Rangers programs consist of scenes featuring English - speaking actors ( either from the United States , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , or the United Kingdom ) spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot ( Zord and Megazord ) battles with English dubbing . In some series , original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the Power Rangers production . Like many of Saban Entertainment previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience , the plot , character names , and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage , though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season . </P> <P> Along with adapting the villains from the Super Sentai counterparts , most Power Rangers series also feature villains with no Sentai counterpart . Generally , the primary antagonist of a Power Rangers series ( for example , Lord Zedd , Divatox , etc . ) are not adapted from the Sentai . Exceptions to this includes Mighty Morphin , Zeo , Lightspeed Rescue and a few others which only use villains adapted from the Japanese shows . </P> <P> The series that began the franchise , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ( an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series , Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger ) , began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids block of programing that aired on the FOX network . It lasted for three seasons ( from 1993 to 1996 ) . </P> <H3> Broadcast history </H3> The Saban Entertainment run of the franchise -- beginning with Power Rangers in Space -- used this version of the Power Rangers logo ( 1998 -- 2001 ) . <P> Saban Entertainment distributed the Power Rangers series from 1993 until the end of 2001 , and Fox broadcast it until the fall of 2002 . The Walt Disney Company purchased the franchise as part of a buyout that took place in 2001 . This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming ABC Family Worldwide Inc . This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment in 2002 , from News Corporation , Fox 's parent company , and Haim Saban . The show continued to air on Fox until the company replaced its Fox Kids package with `` FoxBox '' in the United States . Since September 2002 , all Power Rangers shows had aired on various Disney - owned networks ( ABC Kids , Toon Disney and Jetix channels worldwide ) . When Wild Force ended , Disney moved production of the franchise from Los Angeles to New Zealand . This resulted in the closure of MMPR Productions and the dismissal of many members of the production . From Ninja Storm to date , Power Rangers is produced in New Zealand . ABC Family , another Disney - owned network , also used to air Power Rangers until it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31 , 2006 . On February 12 , 2009 , Toon Disney ended in the wake of Disney XD , ending cable airings of Power Rangers in certain areas of the United States . Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups declined to air most of the Power Rangers series since 2006 due to the lack of FCC - compliant educational and informational content in the programs . </P> <P> The Saban era seasons , starting with In Space , have gone under the `` Saban 's Power Rangers '' moniker , up until Time Force . Since the re-acquisition of Power Rangers by Saban in 2010 , this practice has continued once again starting with Samurai . </P> <P> Starting in 2005 , up until 2007 , during its run on Jetix , Power Rangers reruns were aired under the moniker Power Rangers Generations , showcasing select episodes from Mighty Morphin through Dino Thunder . </P> <P> An article in The New Zealand Herald published on March 7 , 2009 , identified Power Rangers RPM as the last season of the Power Rangers run . Production manager Sally Campbell stated in an interview , `` ... at this stage we will not be shooting another season . '' A September 1 , 2009 , revision to Disney A to Z : The Official Encyclopedia by Disney 's head archivist Dave Smith states that `` production of new episodes ( of Power Rangers ) ceased in 2009 '' . Production of Power Rangers ceased and the last series by BVS Entertainment , RPM , ended on December 26 , 2009 . </P> <P> On October 1 , 2009 , Bandai released a press release that Disney would re-broadcast Mighty Morphin Power Rangers starting in January 2010 on ABC Kids in lieu of a new series utilizing footage from the 2009 Super Sentai television series . A new toy line accompanied the series and appeared in stores in the later part of 2009 . ABC 's over-the air telecasts ended on August 28 , 2010 , and turned the hour back to affiliates . </P> <P> On May 12 , 2010 , Haim Saban bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million and announced plans to produce a new season of the television series . The eighteenth season , Samurai , began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7 , 2011 , with the previous episodes beginning rebroadcast on Nicktoons later that year . It was also announced that Saban plans to make a new Power Rangers movie . </P> <P> On July 2 , 2012 , it was announced that Saban Brands would launch a Saturday morning cartoon block on The CW , called Vortexx , on August 25 , 2012 , that would air Power Rangers Lost Galaxy . To commemorate the series ' 20th anniversary , Nickelodeon began airing Power Rangers Megaforce on February 2 , 2013 , featuring all of the past rangers from the series ' 20 - year history . On October 1 , 2013 , Saban Brands announced that it had extended agreements with Nickelodeon and Bandai America Incorporated through 2016 for its globally recognized Power Rangers franchise . In January 2016 , Saban and Nickelodeon extended their broadcast partnership through 2018 . </P> <P> The 90s Are All That aired Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as part of Mighty Morphin Weekend in 2013 . </P> <H2> Television series </H2> Main article : List of Power Rangers episodes Variations of Power Rangers throughout the franchise unite . <P> The first series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers through In Space followed a story arc called `` The Zordon Era '' with a gradually changing cast and characters over six years . Beginning with Lost Galaxy , although it had ties with the previous story arc , each Power Rangers series had its own self - contained storylines , independent of previous series . Crossover episodes between different series featuring rangers , villains , and other characters from past seasons also began with Lost Galaxy , with a few exceptions . </P> <H3> The Saban Era </H3> <P> The Saban Era is seasons 1 - 10 that includes Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ( 1993 - 1996 ) to Power Rangers Wild Force ( 2002 ) .

As of 2006 , Power Rangers aired at least 65 times a week in more than 40 worldwide markets . Many markets carry or have carried the series on their respective Fox or later Jetix / Disney XD channels or have syndicated the program on regional children 's channels or blocks , either dubbed into the local language or broadcast in the original English . Since the 2010 acquisition by Saban Brands , international television distribution rights for Power Rangers have been managed by MarVista Entertainment . </P> <P> Broadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently from in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of ' the Super Sentai brand originating in Japan . Power Rangers was briefly banned in Malaysia for supposedly encouraging the use of drugs because it contained the word `` Morphin ' '' in its title , which could be associated with morphine . The show eventually aired without the offending word . In Japan , many Power Rangers television seasons and movies were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past Super Sentai casts , leading to the English - dubbed action sequences being `` re-dubbed '' or `` restored '' back to Japanese as well . Power Rangers Mystic Force is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in January 2014 , with the Magiranger cast voicing their counterparts . After broadcast of Power Rangers ended in South Korea with Wild Force , Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed Super Sentai series under the 파워 레인저 ( Power Ranger ) brand on JEI TV . Some seasons of Super Sentai broadcast in South Korea have similarly named titles as their American counterparts , such as Power Ranger Dino Thunder for Abaranger in 2007 and Power Ranger S.P.D. in place of Dekaranger . </P> <H3> Home media </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may only interest a specific audience .

When Saban bought Power Rangers back , the series aired new episodes on Nickelodeon , while previous seasons aired on Nicktoons . </P> <H2> Video games </H2> Main article : List of Power Rangers video games <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Television in the United States portal </Li> <Li> Film in the United States portal </Li> <Li> Science Fiction portal </Li> <Li> 1990s portal </Li> <Li> 2000s portal </Li> <Li> 2010s portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Big Bad Beetleborgs </Li> <Li> Kamen Rider : Dragon Knight </Li> <Li> List of Power Rangers cast members </Li> <Li> Masked Rider </Li> <Li> Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog </Li> <Li> Ninja Turtles : The Next Mutation </Li> <Li> Super Sentai </Li> <Li> Superhuman Samurai Syber - Squad </Li> <Li> Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills </Li> <Li> VR Troopers </Li> <Li> List of the highest - grossing media franchises </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ As the series progresses , one or more of the Rangers will usually receive motorcycles for long - distance travel , as well as individual Zords . In many series , a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons . In some cases , one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers do not ; an example is the Battlizer given to the Red Ranger of each series since Power Rangers in Space ( until Operation Overdrive ) . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Public servants ( rescue squad , police officers , etc . ) appearing as Rangers disregard this convention in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue , Power Rangers S.P.D. , Power Rangers Operation Overdrive and Power Rangers RPM . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ An original Power Ranger , the Titanium Ranger , was created especially for Lightspeed Rescue to add a sixth Power Ranger to the series . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Other color designations include metallic colors , violet , and `` Shadow '' , as well as protagonists who have powers and costumes similar to those of the Rangers but are not called `` Power Rangers '' , such as the Blue Senturion and Koragg the Knight Wolf . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ A joke highlighted this correlation in Dino Thunder when Tommy Oliver ( a former Green Ranger , White Ranger , and Red Ranger ) became the new Black Ranger ; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black - colored clothing . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Toei Company Profile Toei '' .

The films star Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley , a street - smart Detroit cop who travels to Beverly Hills , California to investigate crimes , even though it is out of his jurisdiction . There , he meets Detective Billy Rosewood ( Judge Reinhold ) , Sergeant John Taggart ( John Ashton ) , and Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil ( Ronny Cox ) . Ashton and Cox do not appear in Beverly Hills Cop III . Murphy , Reinhold , and Gil Hill , who plays Axel 's boss , Inspector Todd , are the only actors who appear in all three films . Harold Faltermeyer produced the now famous `` Axel F '' theme song heard throughout the series . The series as a whole have been distributed by Paramount Pictures . The films have made a total of $ 735,534,503 at the worldwide box office . </P> <P> Following a failed attempt at a television series based on the films , Paramount decided to produce another film with a currently unknown release date . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Films <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Overview </Li> <Li> 1.2 Unaired television pilot </Li> <Li> 1.3 Cast and characters </Li> <Li> 1.4 Music </Li> <Li> 1.5 Future </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Crew </Li> <Li> 3 Reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Box office performance </Li> <Li> 3.2 Critical and public reaction </Li> <Li> 3.3 Accolades </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Films ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Overview ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Beverly Hills Cop ( 1984 ) Axel Foley ( Eddie Murphy ) is introduced as a Detroit cop who , after the murder of his friend , travels to California to investigate and track down the killer ( s ) , who he believes operate an arts dealership as a cover in Beverly Hills . He teams up with two reluctant detectives , Billy Rosewood ( Judge Reinhold ) and John Taggart ( John Ashton ) , from the Beverly Hills police department who were supposed to keep a watch on him , especially after seeing Foley 's different approach to tackling the situations which were considered unacceptable by the chief of police . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Beverly Hills Cop II ( 1987 ) Axel returns to Beverly Hills , after finding out that Captain Andrew Bogomil ( Ronny Cox ) was shot . He once again teams up with Detective Billy Rosewood and Sgt . John Taggart , who , reluctantly and against incompetent and verbally abusive Police Chief Harold Lutz 's ( Allen Garfield ) orders , help Foley to find out the person responsible for Bogomil 's shooting . Axel , Billy , and John soon discover that the alphabet crimes , a series of felonies ( robberies and Bogomil 's shooting ) that have been going on in the area , are masterminded by weapons kingpin Maxwell Dent ( Jürgen Prochnow ) . With this information , Axel , Billy , and Taggart try to find Dent and his lover , Karla Fry ( Brigitte Nielsen ) , ( who had shot Bogomil ) . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Beverly Hills Cop III ( 1994 ) Axel returns to Beverly Hills once again . During an assignment , his boss , Inspector Todd ( Gil Hill ) is killed , and certain evidence points towards an amusement park called `` Wonderworld '' . Upon arriving in Beverly Hills , Axel looks up his old friend Billy Rosewood who has attained the title of DDOJSIOC ( Deputy Director of Joint Special Inter Operational Command ) . Bogomil and Taggart have retired and a new detective called Jon Flint ( Hector Elizondo ) is Rosewood 's new partner . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Unaired television pilot ( edit ) </H3> <P> CBS ordered a pilot with Brandon T. Jackson starring as Axel Foley 's son , Aaron . The hour long crime drama was produced by the critically acclaimed writer Shawn Ryan who created The Shield and The Chicago Code . </P> <P> In January 2013 , Ryan stated , `` It 's going to be a CBS procedural . We 're going to solve a case every week , but we 're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun . And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is , in a day and age when income inequality and class inequities dominate a lot of the country , this is going to be an opportunity to put a young working - class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills , you can do a lot of stealth social commentary . My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013 . The pilot opens with a 4 - 5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous , that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield . I want it to feel grounded in that way . There 'll be some opportunities for laughs after that . It 's not a laughs come first show . '' </P> <P> In February 2013 , Kevin Pollak was cast as Rodney Daloof , an irritating and incredibly risk - averse in - house attorney for the Beverly Hills Police Department . David Denman was cast as Brad , an honest and likable but socially awkward detective , formerly a baseball player and a musician . Director Barry Sonnenfeld agreed to both direct the Beverly Hills Cop pilot and serve as an executive producer . In May 2013 , CBS decided to pass on the Beverly Hills Cop TV series . In August 2013 , Brandon T. Jackson give his reason about the pass : </P> <P> I think we were very edgy for CBS . I think we were the edgiest as you could 've went for CBS . It would have been like a ' Fresh Prince ' thing on CBS , like the edgiest you can go on network TV . But it does n't agree to our franchise man . '' </P> <P> In February 2015 , Eddie Murphy stated that his cameo appearance in the pilot ironically doomed the show 's chances : `` I was gon na be in the pilot , and they thought I should be recurring . I 'm not gon na do Beverly Hills Cop on TV . I remember when they tested it -- they had this little knob that you turn if you like it or you do n't like it . So when Axel shows up in the pilot , some people turned the knob so much , they broke it . So the network decided ' if he is n't recurring , then this is n't gon na happen . ' So it did n't happen . '' </P> <P> In a January 2016 interview , Shawn Ryan blamed personality clashes with the network : `` The official answer is they decided they liked other pilots better . If you look at what pilots they picked up that year , I think that 's kind of incredible . I would say there were a lot of 400 lb . gorillas involved in the show and sometimes the gorillas do n't always get along . '' . He also said that he was very proud of the pilot and loved working with Murphy . </P> <P> During late Summer 2013 , after CBS decided to pass on the TV series , Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film . </P> <H3> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Character </Th> <Th_colspan=""3""> Films </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Beverly Hills Cop </Th> <Th> Beverly Hills Cop II </Th> <Th> Beverly Hills Cop III </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Axel Foley </Td> <Td_colspan=""3""> Eddie Murphy </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Billy Rosewood </Td> <Td_colspan=""3""> Judge Reinhold </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jenny Summers </Td> <Td> Lisa Eilbacher </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> John Taggart </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> John Ashton </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Andrew Bogomil </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> Ronny Cox </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> G.

The theme became popular with audiences , and has been remixed by Crazy Frog . A new version of the theme was created for Beverly Hills Cop III , with Faltermeyer not returning for the film . </P> <H3> Future ( edit ) </H3> <P> A fourth entry in the series was initially announced for release in the mid-1990s , under the production of Eddie Murphy 's own production company `` Eddie Murphy Productions '' , though production later fizzled out . It was re-announced in 2006 , when producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced his intention to resurrect the film series , though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film , instead passing production duties to Lorenzo di Bonaventura . In September 2006 a script , an amalgamation of several earlier drafts , was presented to Murphy who was reported to be `` very happy '' with the outline which was described as an attempt to recapture the `` feel of the original '' . Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourth Beverly Hills Cop film was to make up for the fact that the third film was `` horrible '' and that `` he did n't want to leave ( the series ) like that '' . </P> <P> In May 2008 , Rush Hour director Brett Ratner was officially named director , who promised the film would return under the series ' standard `` R '' rating , rather than as a rumored watered down PG - 13 . Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script , under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009 , which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood . The script was eventually rejected , leaving Ratner to work on a new idea . In an interview with Empire magazine , Ratner stated `` I 'm working very hard on the fourth . It 's very difficult , especially since there were three before . We 're trying to figure out some important things , like where do we start ? Is Axel retired ? Is he in Beverly Hills ? Is he on vacation ? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood ? Many questions to figure out , but I 'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence . '' Although Murphy himself committed to the project , it was unconfirmed whether the series ' other principal actors , Judge Reinhold , John Ashton , Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return , though Ratner stated in late 2009 that he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles . Harold Faltermeyer 's `` Axel F '' , however , would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment , with Ratner quoted as saying `` It 'll be back but it 'll be a whole new interpretation . '' On November 15 , 2010 , Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film , but that it would n't be `` anytime soon . '' </P> <P> In October 2011 , Murphy discussed a possible fourth film , stating , `` They 're not doing it . What I 'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley 's son , and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit . I 'd do the pilot , show up here and there . None of the movie scripts were right ; it was trying to force the premise . If you have to force something , you should n't be doing it . It was always a rehash of the old thing . It was always wrong . '' </P> <P> During late Summer 2013 , after CBS decided to pass on the TV series , Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film . On September 13 , 2013 , Jerry Bruckheimer , stated he was in talks to produce . On December 6 , 2013 , it was announced that Eddie Murphy will again reprise the role of Axel Foley and Brett Ratner will direct . On May 2 , 2014 , Deadline announced that screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would be penning the screenplay . </P> <P> On June 27 , 2014 , in an interview with Rolling Stone , Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of Axel Foley after years of making family friendly films . `` I have n't done a street guy , working class , blue - collar character in ages so maybe it 's like , ' Oh , wow , I did n't remember he was able to do that , ' '' Murphy said . According to studio reports on the film 's plot , Foley will return to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he will be faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America 's most tenacious cities . The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives , based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state . The film will be shot in and around Detroit and is estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers . The film was originally scheduled for a March 25 , 2016 release , but on May 6 , 2015 , Paramount Pictures pulled Beverly Hills Cop IV from its release schedule , due to script concerns .

The event was not held from 1915 to 1918 because of World War I and again from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II . </P> <P> The Ladies ' Singles ' rules have undergone several changes since the first edition . From 1886 until 1921 , the event started with a knockout phase , the All Comers ' Singles , whose winner then faced the defending champion in a challenge round . The All Comers ' winner was automatically awarded the title six times ( 1887 , 1891 , 1895 , 1907 , 1908 ) in the absence of the previous year 's champion . The challenge round system was abolished with the 1922 edition . Since the first championships , all matches have been played at the best - of - three sets . Between 1877 and 1883 , the winner of the next game at five games - all took the set in every match except the All Comers ' final , and the challenge round , which were won with six games and a two games advantage . All sets were decided in two - game advantage format from 1884 to 1970 . The lingering death best - of - 12 points tie - break was introduced in 1971 for the first two sets , played at eight games - all until 1978 and at six games - all since 1979 . </P> <P> The Ladies ' Singles champion receives a sterling silver salver commonly known as the `` Venus Rosewater Dish '' , or simply the `` Rosewater Dish '' . The salver , which is 18.75 inches ( about 48 cm ) in diameter , is decorated with figures from mythology . New singles champions are traditionally elected honorary members of the AELTC by the club 's committee . In 2012 , the Ladies ' Singles winner received prize money of £ 1,150,000 . </P> <P> These records include the Amateur Era only , Dorothea Lambert Chambers ( 1903 -- 1904 , 1906 , 1910 -- 1911 , 1913 -- 1914 ) holds the record for most titles , with seven , and Lottie Dod ( 1891 -- 1893 ) and Suzanne Lenglen ( 1919 -- 1921 ) holds the record for most consecutive wins in the Ladies ' Singles during the challenge round era , with three victories each . The record for most consecutive and most wins post challenge round during the Amateur Era is Helen Wills Moody ( 1927 -- 1930 ) , with four straight wins , and Moody holds the record for most victories in this era with eight ( 1927 -- 1930 , 1932 -- 1933 , 1935 , 1938 ) . </P> <P> These records only include the Open Era , since the inclusion of the professional tennis players , Martina Navratilova ( 1978 -- 1979 , 1982 -- 1987 , 1990 ) holds the record for most victories with nine . Navratilova holds the record for most consecutive victories with six ( 1982 -- 1987 ) . </P> <P> This event has been won without the loss of a set , during the Open Era of Tennis , by the following players : Billie Jean King in 1968 , 1972 , 1973 and 1975 , Margaret Court in 1970 , Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1971 and 1980 , Chris Evert in 1974 and 1981 , Martina Navratilova in 1979 , 1983 , 1984 , 1986 , 1987 , and 1990 , Steffi Graf in 1992 and 1996 , Jana Novotná in 1998 , Lindsay Davenport in 1999 , Venus Williams in 2000 , 2007 and 2008 , Serena Williams in 2002 , 2009 , 2010 , 2015 and 2016 , Maria Sharapova in 2004 , Petra Kvitová in 2011 and 2014 and Marion Bartoli in 2013 . </P> <H2> Champions ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Regular competition </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> All Comers ' winner , Challenge round winner ‡ </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Defending champion , Challenge round winner † </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> All Comers ' winner , no Challenge round ◊ </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Amateur Era ( edit ) </H3> Lottie Dod was a five - time champion and is the youngest ever winner of the ladies ' singles championships ( 15 years and 285 days ) .

and night - time play . </Li> <Li> Wimbledon entered the Open Era with the 1968 edition , allowing professional players to compete alongside amateurs . </Li> <Li> John McEnroe is the only player to have been denied membership in 1981 , because of his on - court behaviour during the championships . </Li> <Li> Each year is linked to an article about that particular year 's draws , but pre-1922 they did not have draws due to the challenge round system . In 1922 till the present they do have draws , but the years of 1925 -- 1939 do not have draw pages with links , so it is linked to the year 's articles instead . </Li> <Li> `` British Isles '' ( BRI ) is used for players from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( 1801 -- 1922 ) , distinct from `` Great Britain '' ( GBR ) used for players from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ( 1922 -- present ) . </Li> <Li> The tournament was not held from 1915 to 1918 because of World War I . </Li> <Li> The tournament was not held from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II . </Li> <Li> Czechoslovakia ( TCH , 1918 -- 1992 ) split into the Czech Republic ( CZE , 1992 -- present ) and Slovakia ( SVK , 1992 -- present ) . </Li> <Li> Martina Navratilova was born in Czechoslovakia , but was stripped of her citizenship in 1975 when she defected to the United States . She became a US citizen in 1981 . </Li> <Li> FRG is West Germany , but after unification became just Germany ( GER ) after 1990 . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> General </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> `` Ladies ' Singles Finals '' . wimbledon.org .

The event is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match , a battle royal whose participants enter at timed intervals . The Greatest Royal Rumble included the largest version of the match to date , having a total of 50 participants . </P> <P> On March 5 , 2018 , WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble , a live event to be held on April 27 , 2018 , at King Abdullah International Stadium , part of the King Abdullah Sports City , in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . The event is a part of a 10 - year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030 , Saudi Arabia 's social and economic reform program . </P> <P> On March 19 , 2018 , WWE scheduled seven championship matches for the event : the WWE Championship , Universal Championship , United States Championship , Intercontinental Championship , SmackDown Tag Team Championship , Raw Tag Team Championship and Cruiserweight Championship were to be defended at the event . </P> <P> As revealed on March 22 , 2018 , the event was streamed live on the WWE Network . It also aired on traditional pay - per - view in the United States and internationally . The event was also the first WWE pay - per - view to feature Arabic commentary . </P> <P> In the weeks leading up to the event , the WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia . From these tryouts , eight were selected to receive training by WWE , which would include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event itself . </P> <H3> Storylines ( edit ) </H3> <P> The card comprised ten matches that resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by WWE on the Raw and SmackDown brands . Storylines were produced on WWE 's weekly television shows , Monday Night Raw , SmackDown Live , and the cruiserweight - exclusive 205 Live . </P> <P> On April 9 , Brock Lesnar , who had renewed his WWE contract , was scheduled to defend the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match as a rematch from WrestleMania 34 . On Raw following WrestleMania , Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his future matches and opponents , singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar . Reigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him . Samoa Joe , who had been out with an injury since January , came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again . </P> <P> On March 26 , WWE scheduled a ladder match between then - champion The Miz , Seth Rollins , Finn Bálor , and Samoa Joe for the Intercontinental Championship . At WrestleMania 34 , The Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Rollins , thus making Rollins the defending champion . Both Miz and Joe were traded to SmackDown while Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw . </P> <P> On March 26 , Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz ( Jeff and Matt Hardy ) . At WrestleMania 34 , however , Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to Braun Strowman and 10 - year - old Nicholas . The following night on Raw , Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas being a fourth grader . Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back , but Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four - team Tag Team Eliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble . `` Woken '' Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt won the tournament by defeating Titus Worldwide ( Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil ) and The Revival ( Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson ) . Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during the Superstar Shake - up . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , The Bludgeon Brothers ( Harper and Rowan ) defeated The Usos ( Jey and Jimmy Uso ) and The New Day 's Big E and Kofi Kingston in a triple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship . On the following SmackDown , The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title match at Greatest Royal Rumble . </P> <P> A match between John Cena and Triple H was scheduled on March 26 . </P> <P> The Undertaker , was originally scheduled to face Rusev in a casket match , the first match of its kind in three years . Due to reasons not entirely clear , Rusev was temporarily replaced by Chris Jericho -- this was explained with Rusev 's wife Lana complaining about her husband competing in a casket match -- but eventually reinserted back into the match . Jericho was restored to his original participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , Jinder Mahal defeated Randy Orton , Bobby Roode , and Rusev in a fatal - four way match to win the United States Championship . Mahal was then traded to Raw and lost the championship to Jeff Hardy and Mahal invoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble . Hardy was then traded to SmackDown the following night . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura . After the match , showed his respect to Styles but then attacked him with a low blow and a Kinshasa , turning heel . On April 17 , after repeated attacks on Styles by Nakamura , a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble . </P> <P> On the WrestleMania 34 pre-show , Cedric Alexander defeated Mustafa Ali in the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament final to win the vacant title . Two nights later on 205 Live , Buddy Murphy attacked the new champion during his celebration . Murphy was then scheduled to face Alexander for the title at the Greatest Royal Rumble , but he failed his mandatory weigh - in when he weighed 207 pounds , 2 pounds over the 205 pound weight limit . He was then removed from the match and banned from competing on 205 Live until he met the weight requirement . The following week , Kalisto earned a Cruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a gauntlet match . </P> <H2> Event ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Preliminary matches ( edit ) </H3> <Table> Other on - screen personnel <Tr> <Th> Role : </Th> <Th> Name : </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> English commentators </Td> <Td> Michael Cole </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Corey Graves </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Byron Saxton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Spanish commentators </Td> <Td> Carlos Cabrera </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Marcelo Rodríguez </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Arabic commentators </Td> <Td> Faisal Almughaisib </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sultan Alharbi </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jude Aldajani </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ring announcer </Td> <Td> Greg Hamilton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Referees </Td> <Td> Danilo Anfibio </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jason Ayers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> John Cone </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Engler </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Darrick Moore </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Chad Patton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ryan Tran </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Interviewer </Td> <Td> Mike Rome </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Pre-show panel </Td> <Td> Byron Saxton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jerry Lawler </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jim Ross </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Booker T </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The actual pay - per - view opened with John Cena facing Triple H. During the match , after trading finishers , and reversing each other 's finishers , Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Triple H , a springboard into the corner turnbuckle , followed and another Attitude Adjustment to pick up the victory . Following the match Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality , and expressed excitement over the event . </P> <P> In the following match , Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto . The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title . </P> <P> Next , the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions , Cesaro and Sheamus . In the end , Hardy distracted Sheamus , allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him . Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the title . </P> <P> Jeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal . In the end , Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title . </P> <P> After that , The Bludgeons Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained their titles after performing a Double Crucifix Powerbomb on Jimmy Uso . </P> <P> Next , Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor , Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match . Near the end of the match , Finn Balor climbed the ladder to unhook the championship , only for Rollins to leap from the top rope onto the ladder and managed to retrieve the title belt before Balor , thus retaining his championship . </P> <P> Later , AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura . During the match , Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics , such as a Low Blow , increasingly frustrating Styles . In the end , both Nakamura and Styles brawled outside of the ring only for the match to end in a double countout . Post-match Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm over the top rope on Nakamura . </P> <P> After that , The Undertaker fought Rusev ( who was accompanied by Aiden English ) in a Casket match . At the end of the match , Undertaker performed a Chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket . Before he could close the lid , English attacked the Undertaker , who retailiated with another Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory . </P> <P> In the penultimate match , Brock Lesnar ( accompanied by Paul Heyman ) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match . Lesnar delivered multiple German Suplexes during the match , and both men kicked out of each other 's finishing moves . At one point in the match , Reigns tried to escape the cage through the door only for Heyman to slam the door on Reigns . The match ended after Reigns put Lesnar through the cage wall with a Spear , sending it onto the floor . Despite Reigns touching the floor with both feet first , the referee awarded the win to Lesnar , thereby retaining the Universal Championship . </P> <H3> Main event ( edit ) </H3> <P> Daniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler began the 50 - man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants . Bryan survived until the final 3 , beating out Rey Mysterio for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes . At the end of the match , Big Cass eliminated Bryan only for Cass to then attempt a Big Boot on Braun Strowman , who ducked and knocked Cass over the top rope to win the match . Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13 , beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12 . Post-match , Strowman received a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship . </P> <H2> Controversy ( edit ) </H2> See also : Women in WWE <P> WWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers , who were unable to perform at the event due to the limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia . Triple H , WWE 's Executive Vice President of Talent , Live Events and Creative , responded to the criticism : `` I understand that people are questioning it , but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you do n't agree with a certain aspect of it , it does n't mean it 's not a relevant culture ... You ca n't dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but , having said that , WWE is at the forefront of a women 's evolution in the world and what you ca n't do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it ... While women are not competing in the event , we have had discussions about that and hope that , in the next few years they will be '' . Women were in attendance for the event , though only if accompanied by a male guardian . This was a major change from previous events , which were only open to men . Associated Press noted that this is due to `` a series of social changes '' by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman . During the event , WWE aired a promotional video , which included WWE female wrestlers . The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for `` indecent material '' that aired at the event . </P> <P> In addition to the women , wrestler Sami Zayn did not participate in the event as Zayn is of Syrian descent , and Saudi Arabia has strained relations with Syria . </P> <P> Another subject of criticism was the situation of LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia , as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death . </P> <H2> Results ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Results </Th> <Th> Stipulations </Th> <Th> Times </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th>

Arabic : حزام بطولة المملكة ) , is a professional wrestling championship created and promoted by American professional wrestling promotion WWE and sanctioned by the Saudi General Sports Authority . The current and inaugural champion is Braun Strowman , who was awarded the championship for winning the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match at the namesake event . </P> <H3> History ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 5 , 2018 , WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble , a live event to be held on April 27 , 2018 , at King Abdullah International Stadium , part of the King Abdullah Sports City , in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . The event was part of a 10 - year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030 , Saudi Arabia 's social and economic reform program . The Greatest Royal Rumble Championship was unveiled by WWE on April 27 , 2018 during the Greatest Royal Rumble event . The championship was announced on the official website of the Saudi General Sports Authority as the Belt Kingdom Championship . Braun Strowman , the 41st entrant of the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match , became the inaugural Greatest Royal Rumble Champion by lastly eliminating Big Cass . </P> <H3> Championship belt design ( edit ) </H3> <P> As with some other championship belts unveiled in 2016 , the base design is similar to the WWE Championship , with notable differences . Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo , the center plate is modeled with Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center . Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016 and 2017 , the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt features two side plates , both separated by gold divider bars , with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion 's logo ; the default plates feature the official logo of Saudi General Sports Authority which is identical to the national emblem of Saudi Arabia . The plates are on a green leather strap resembling the color of the national flag of Saudi Arabia . </P> <H3> Reigns ( edit ) </H3> <P> As of May 28 , 2018 , there has been one reign , which is the inaugural and current champion , Braun Strowman . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Champion </Th> <Th> Reign </Th> <Th> Date </Th> <Th> Days held </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> Event </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> Strowman , Braun Braun Strowman </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> April 27 , 2018 </Td> <Td> 7001310000000000000 ♠ 31 + </Td> <Td> Jeddah , Saudi Arabia </Td> <Td> Greatest Royal Rumble </Td> <Td> Became the inaugural champion by winning the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Let 's rumble like never before . `` When Legends Rise '' by @ godsmack is an # OfficialThemeSong for the Greatest Royal Rumble event . # WWEGRR `` .

Set in New York City , the film is loosely based on events in New York and Chicago from the early 1920s to 1931 during Prohibition , specifically the exploits of real - life gangsters like Al Capone and Bugs Moran , as dramatized in cinema . Parker lightened the subject matter considerably for the children 's market ; in the U.S. the film received a G rating . </P> <P> The film was Parker 's feature - length directorial debut , introduced actor Scott Baio , and featured a 13 - year old Jodie Foster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Casting </Li> <Li> 3.2 Music </Li> <Li> 3.3 Filming </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Release </Li> <Li> 5 Accolades </Li> <Li> 6 Home media </Li> <Li> 7 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 8 Legacy </Li> <Li> 9 Stage adaptation </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> A mobster named Roxy Robinson is `` splurged '' by members of a gang , using rapid - fire cream - shooting `` splurge guns '' . Once splurged , a kid is `` all washed up ... finished '' . Speakeasy boss Fat Sam introduces himself and Bugsy Malone , a boxing promoter with no money ( `` Bugsy Malone '' ) . </P> <P> At Fat Sam 's speakeasy , there is much dancing and singing ( `` Fat Sam 's Grand Slam '' ) . Fat Sam is worried that his rival Dandy Dan will try to take control of the speakeasy . Blousey Brown , an aspiring singer , has come for an audition , but Sam is too distracted to see her . Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage . He is smitten and flirts with her . Fat Sam 's is raided by Dandy Dan 's men , who shoot up the place . Dandy Dan 's men continue to attack Fat Sam 's empire , eventually taking away rackets and splurging members of Fat Sam 's gang . Fat Sam sends all his available men to see if they can track down the guns . They are trapped at a laundry and all are splurged by Dandy Dan 's gang . </P> <P> Bugsy returns to Fat Sam 's to arrange a new audition for Blousey . Fat Sam 's girlfriend , the chanteuse Tallulah , makes a pass at him . Although Bugsy rejects her flirtation , Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy 's forehead when Blousey enters ; Blousey is jealous . Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition , but she refuses to speak to Bugsy ( `` I 'm Feelin ' Fine '' ) . </P> <P> Fat Sam hires Bugsy to accompany him to a meeting with Dandy Dan . The meeting is a trap , but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape . Gratefully , Fat Sam pays him $200 . Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake ; Bugsy promises to take her to Hollywood . When he returns Sam 's car to the garage , he is attacked and his money is stolen . Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith , who assaults the attackers and drives them away . Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the potential to be a great boxer . Bugsy introduces Leroy to Cagey Joe and helps him train ( `` So You Wanna Be a Boxer ? '' ) . Fat Sam again seeks Bugsy 's aid after his assistant Knuckles is unintentionally killed . Bugsy resists , but Fat Sam offers $400 , enough money to keep his promise to Blousey . Blousey is disappointed when she learns that Bugsy has n't bought the tickets to California yet ( `` Ordinary Fool '' ) . Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan 's men to a warehouse , where the guns are being stashed . The two of them ca n't take the place alone , so Bugsy recruits a large group of down - and - out workers at a soup kitchen ( `` Down and Out '' ) . </P> <P> They steal the crates of guns and take them to Fat Sam 's , arriving just as Dandy Dan 's gang arrives . Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts , covering everyone ( except Bugsy and Blousey ) with cream . Unarmed patrons throw cream pies . The piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys , striking a single bass note . The tone silences the room , and the cream - covered crowd performs in a final number ( `` You Give a Little Love '' ) . They realize they can all be friends , and Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Scott Baio as Bugsy Malone , an Italian - Irish ex-boxer / boxing scout . </Li> <Li> Florrie Dugger as Blousey Brown , a sassy young dame interested in Hollywood . </Li> <Li> Jodie Foster as Tallulah , Fat Sam 's gun moll , the speakeasy 's star chanteuse and Bugsy 's old flame . </Li> <Li> John Cassisi as Fat Sam Staccetto , crime boss .

Parker was trying to find a film project that was not `` parochial '' and decided upon an American gangster setting : `` I had four young children and we used to go to a cottage in Derbyshire at weekends . On the long , boring car journey up there , I started telling them the story of a gangster called Bugsy Malone . They 'd ask me questions and I 'd make up answers , based on my memories of watching old movie reruns as a kid . '' His eldest son suggested children should be cast as the `` heroes '' . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> The director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film . To find his Fat Sam , Parker visited a Brooklyn classroom , asking for `` the naughtiest boy in class '' . The students were unanimous in selecting John Cassisi , and Parker gave him the role . Florrie Dugger ( Blousey ) was originally cast in a smaller role ; when the actress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio , Dugger was promoted . She had been `` discovered '' at RAF Chicksands , an air force base in Bedfordshire where her American father was stationed . At the time of filming , all of the cast were under 17 years old . </P> <P> Parker cast Baio after he slammed down the script and stormed out of his audition . Baio later remembered : </P> <P> I had quit the business , because I did n't like driving into Manhattan . Well , the long and the short of it is that I wanted to play with my friends after school , but it happened to be raining that day , so I went to the city to meet with Alan Parker . I read it , but I just barely read it . I did n't even want to be there . He was English , but I did n't even know what that was . He was just this weird guy with long hair , and I did n't know what he was . ( Laughs . ) So I sort of read the script , threw it at him , and walked out the door . That was it : I 'd gotten the part before I got home . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> Parker chose Paul Williams to score the film in order to get a more `` palatable '' modern sound , and simply because he liked him . Williams had scored Brian De Palma 's commercial failure Phantom of the Paradise , but had also written huge pop - radio hits ( such as `` We 've Only Just Begun '' ( lyrics ) , and `` ( Just An ) Old Fashioned Love Song '' ) . In fact , Williams would soon win an Oscar for his song `` Evergreen '' from the film A Star Is Born ( 1976 ) . </P> <P> Williams felt that `` ... the challenge for me was to provide songs that reflected the period ... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the young audiences attention . '' According to Parker , Williams was writing while on tour , recording songs in different cities , and sending the completed tapes to Hollywood . Arriving during the first pre-shoot rehearsals , the songs had to be accepted and used as they were , with voices by Williams , Archie Hahn and others . </P> <P> Neither the director nor the songwriter was entirely comfortable with the results . Williams later wrote `` I 'm really proud of the work and the only thing I 've ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices . Perhaps I should have given the kids a chance to sing the songs . '' Parker also commented : `` Watching the film after all these years , this is one aspect that I find the most bizarre . Adult voices coming out of these kids ' mouths ? I had told Paul that I did n't want squeaky kids voices and he interpreted this in his own way . Anyway , as the tapes arrived , scarcely weeks away from filming , we had no choice but to go along with it ! '' </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> The film was rehearsed and shot in England , largely on Pinewood Studios ' `` H '' stage , with locations in Black Park Country Park ( Wexham , Buckinghamshire ) and Reading , Berkshire . </P> <P> The `` splurge firearm '' proved to be problematic . After initial experiments with cream - filled wax balls proved painful , Parker decided to abandon the idea of filming the firearms directly . Instead , the firearms fired ping - pong balls , and a fast cut to a victim being pelted with `` splurge '' was used to convey the impression of the rapid - firing firearms . </P> <P> Baio later said making the film was `` awesome '' : </P> <P> A kid 's fantasy : You get to dress up as gangster , you get to shoot guns that fire whipped cream , you get to drive cars with pedals that look like real cars , and you get to talk like a grown - up . I mean , you could n't ask for a better first big gig . Talk about getting you hooked on a business ! It was fantastic . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Bugsy Malone was released in late 1976 to generally positive reviews . On Rotten Tomatoes , it currently holds a score of 83 % based on 18 reviews , with an average rating of 6.6 / 10 . Despite the positive critical reception , Bugsy Malone was not a commercial success in the US , bringing in just over $2.7 million . Paramount gave it a limited release , usually in second - tier theaters in a double - bill with The Bad News Bears , which had already been out for six months and was no longer much of a draw . According to Parker , the film was `` quite successful '' in the United Kingdom . By 1985 , it had earned an estimated profit of £ 1,854,000 . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film garnered 15 award nominations , including `` Best Motion Picture ( Musical / Comedy ) '' , `` Best Original Score '' and `` Best Original Song '' ( for the title track ) from the Golden Globes , and an Oscar for `` Best Original Song Score '' ( Paul Williams ) . The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival . Actress Jodie Foster received two BAFTAs , `` Best Supporting Actress '' and `` Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles '' , however , both her nominations were for her previous year 's work in Taxi Driver in addition to her work on Bugsy Malone . Alan Parker received the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay , and a nomination for Best Direction . Geoffrey Kirkland won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design . Additionally , Paul Williams received a nomination for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , and Monica Howe a Best Costume Design nomination . The film itself received a Best Picture nomination . </P> <P> In 2008 , the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list . </P> <H2> Home media ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the early eighties , Bugsy Malone was released on VHS . On 16 April 1996 , it was re-released by Paramount on VHS . Although the film has never been commercially released on Region 1 DVD , it has been available through Internet sites as an Asian import supporting Region 1 ( US ) . On 9 September 2008 , Arista / SME released a Blu - ray version , encoded for `` all regions '' , as a United Kingdom import . This edition includes a director 's commentary as well as other special features , however , as of October 2009 , the Blu - ray version was discontinued .

Appearing in all three Toy Story films , he usually acts as the leader of the gang . His rivalry with Buzz forms the basis of the plot of the first film . In Toy Story 2 , he is stolen at a yard sale by a toy collector , causing the other toys to embark on a rescue mission . In Toy Story 3 he and the other toys are shipped to a daycare center . </P> <H3> Buzz Lightyear ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Buzz Lightyear <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Tim Allen ( 1995 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Patrick Warburton ( 2000 -- 2001 ) ( Buzz Lightyear of Star Command ) </Li> <Li> Pat Fraley ( Toy Story Treats , few video games , merchandise , attractions ) ( 1996 -- 2005 ) </Li> <Li> Mike MacRae ( video games ) ( 2010 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Javier Fernandez - Peña ( Spanish Buzz ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Previously known as Tinny and Lunar Larry , Buzz Lightyear is a modern - day `` space ranger '' action figure , and wears a green and white space suit with various features such as retractable wings and transparent air helmet , a laser `` weapon , '' and various sound effects . In the films , he acts as Woody 's second - in - command . In Toy Story , he begins the series believing he is a real space ranger ( the other toys are aware that they are toys ) and develops a rivalry with Woody , who resents him for getting more attention as the newcomer . During the film , he comes to realize that he is just a toy , and eventually becomes good friends with Woody . He is extremely loyal to his friends . During his time trapped at Sid 's house , Hannah , Sid 's sister , called Buzz Mrs. Nesbit . In Toy Story 2 , Buzz goes to save Woody from Al with Potato Head , Hamm , Rex , and Slink ( Slinky Dog ) where he gets stuck in the Buzz Lightyear aisle in Al 's Toy Barn by another Buzz and finds out for himself what he was really like . In Toy Story 3 , a relationship begins to develop between Buzz and Jessie . He is particularly open with his affection when accidentally switched to `` Spanish mode . '' </P> <H3> Jessie ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Jessie ( Toy Story ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Joan Cusack ( 1999 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Mary Kay Bergman ( yodeling voice ) Toy Story 2 </Li> <Li> Sarah McLachlan ( singing voice ) Toy Story 2 </Li> <Li> Kathryn Cressida ( Disney Infinity ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Jessie is a cowgirl doll , and part of the Woody 's Round Up gang . Jessie is also Buzz Lightyear 's girlfriend . She first appeared in Toy Story 2 along with Bullseye ( her horse ) and Stinky Pete . Initially , Jessie was hesitant to join Andy 's friends . After she becomes part of the family , she is very happy ( despite that Andy first calls her Bazooka Jane ) . In Toy Story 3 , she was riding Bullseye when Woody fell off the train in Andy 's opening sequence . She argued with Woody on their way to Sunnyside Daycare because of when the others think Andy threw them out . Later in the film , Jessie feels close with Buzz , even when Buzz got switched into Spanish . At the end , Jessie and Buzz danced to the Spanish version of `` You 've Got a Friend in Me . '' Jessie also makes a cameo appearance in Monsters , Inc. as one of the toys Boo gives Sulley . Jessie also appears in Pixar 's production of Toy Story of Terror ! as the main character that saves the other toys from the toy stealer and seller at the rest stop . </P> <H2> Toy characters by owner ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Andy 's toys ( edit ) </H3> Hamm the piggy bank ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> John Ratzenberger ( 1995 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Andrew Stanton ( Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Hamm is a wisecracking realist piggy bank with a cork in his belly in place of a stopper . He and Mr. Potato Head appear to be best friends , and are often seen playing games , such as Battleship ( with Hamm always winning ) . Out of all the toys , he is shown to have the most knowledge of the outside , often being very familiar with various gadgets that are shown , likely as an homage to Ratzenberger 's famous role of mail carrier and bar know - it - all Cliff Clavin on the sitcom Cheers . </P> <P> In Toy Story , Hamm interrupts Woody 's staff meeting by alerting the crowd telling them that the birthday guests are arriving at 3 : 00 . Hamm becomes fascinated with Buzz 's features and ridicules of Woody , along with Potato Head . When Woody inadvertently knocks Buzz off the window , Hamm is one of the many toys who believes that Woody did it intentionally and he turns on him . However , Hamm realizes the truth that Buzz is alive . At the end , Hamm cheers for Potato Head when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head for Christmas . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , Hamm resents the Al 's Toy Barn chicken mascot . When Woody is stolen , he and Mr. Potato Head organize a crime scene to present Woody 's kidnapping to the other toys . After helping the toys find the Al 's Toy Barn commercial on TV , Hamm goes with Buzz , Slinky , Rex , and Mr. Potato Head on a mission to rescue Woody . In Al 's Toy Barn , Hamm spots a `` Bonus Belt '' Buzz , thinking he is Andy 's Buzz , though he comments on the new Buzz 's odd behavior . While following Al to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck , he and Mr. Potato Head operate the truck 's levers and knobs and are advised to pull the gear lever to get the truck to move . While reading the truck 's manual , he states `` I seriously doubt he 's getting this kinda mileage '' . Eventually , Hamm and the other toys are able to rescue Woody and are able to return home in a stolen baggage carrier . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , Hamm is `` Evil Dr. Porkchop '' in Andy 's western play opening sequence , appearing in a giant pig - shaped spaceship to rescue One - Eyed Bart and thwart Woody and his gang . Later , when the toys are accidentally thrown out , Hamm is angry , believing that Andy threw them out on purpose . He escapes with the rest of the toys to Sunnyside Daycare , where he is initially happy to be played with , but dismayed as he realizes the toddlers are too rough . Later that night , Hamm and his friends realize that Woody was telling the truth about Andy . When the toys are imprisoned by Lotso and his henchmen , Hamm is shown to be able to play the harmonica . When Woody comes back to rescue the toys from Sunnyside he quotes `` Return of the Astro - Nut '' on Buzz being turned back to demo . He helps the toys escape by fighting with Rex to distract Buzz , who has been switched to demo mode by Lotso , so that Jessie can trap him under a plastic container . Hamm and Rex , being the heaviest of the toys , sit on top of the container to prevent Buzz from escaping . When Woody returns with Buzz 's instruction manual to switch him back , Hamm reads the instructions while the others hold Buzz down . When they were about to die in the incinerator , Hamm grabbed the hands of Slinky and Rex . Later , after the toys are rescued from an incinerator - related death at the dump due to Lotso 's selfishness , Hamm , along with Slinky , wants revenge , but Woody talks them both out of it . He is donated along with Andy 's other toys to Bonnie , where he becomes best friends with Buttercup . </P> <P> In a 2010 advertisement for the United States Postal Service promoting Toy Story 3 , Hamm wears a postal worker 's hat while promoting the Priority Mail service ; Ratzenberger is best known for his role as mailman Cliff Clavin on the long - running sitcom Cheers . He also makes an appearance in the Toy Story 3 video game as the mayor in Toy Box mode . </P> <P> Hamm also appears in the theatrical short films Hawaiian Vacation , Small Fry and Partysaurus Rex . </P> Rex the Tyrannosaurus Rex ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Wallace Shawn ( 1995 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Earl Boen ( video games ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Rex is an excitable large , green , plastic Tyrannosaurus Rex . Rex suffers from anxiety , an inferiority complex and the concern that he is not scary enough . Rex 's worst fear ( after Sid ) is that Andy will get another , scarier dinosaur . He is among the largest of Andy 's toys , and is often depicted as the heaviest . He is voiced by Earl Boen in the video games Toy Story 2 : Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue ( 1999 ) and Toy Story Racer ( 2001 ) . Although Rex is a toy dinosaur he dislikes confrontation and is sensitive in nature . </P> <P> In Toy Story , he states that he was manufactured by a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout by Mattel ( coincidentally , real - life Rex toys used to be made by Hasbro , but as of 2009 are indeed made by Mattel ) . He is first introduced when he moves Woody 's doodle pad , then tries to scare Woody with his roar . When Buzz arrives , Rex is fascinated by his cool features . Later , when Woody knocks Buzz out the window , he reluctantly sides against Woody out of pressure from the other toys . He is , however , a great deal less antagonistic than most of the other toys . He later feels guilty when everyone discovers Woody was telling the truth all along . He gains confidence at the end , saying he could play as the dominant predator if Andy gets a leaf eater . </P> <P> The beginning of Toy Story 2 , he is shown playing the `` Buzz Lightyear : Attack on Zurg '' video game , which he loses , much to his frustration . He is responsible for the toys seeing the commercial for Al 's Toy Barn commercial when he accidentally clicks the remote control . When Woody was kidnapped by Al , Rex tried to send a message to the FBI for help , but he did n't know how to write FBI , and later joins Buzz ' team to rescue Woody . Inside Al 's Toy Barn , he excitedly finds a `` Buzz Lightyear '' video game strategy guide , which he takes with him . He loses the guide later , but is still able to give Buzz two tips from the guide on defeating Zurg . In a parody of Jurassic Park , he chases a car driven by the toys in Al 's Toy Barn , in which Mr. Potato Head spots his reflection in the rear view mirror . It is Rex 's tail sticking out of Al 's bag that later causes the real Buzz to go after them . When the other Toys , led by Buzz 2 reach Al 's Apartment , the toys use an unwilling Rex as a battering ram to break in against the unlocked grate . When Zurg is about to finish off Buzz 2 , he turns away , not bearing to look anymore , but his tail knocks Zurg down the elevator shaft , making him feel overjoyed about finally defeating Zurg for real . While following Al to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck , he serves as the navigator and tells Buzz which way to go since he ca n't see out the window while controlling the steering wheel . Eventually , he and the others manage to rescue Woody and return home in a stolen baggage carrier . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , he is Woody 's `` Dinosaur who Eats Force Field Dogs '' in Andy 's opening western play sequence , where he frightens One - Eyed Bart and his gang with a terrifying roar , but is then overpowered by a flood of monkeys . He is seen to be especially sad about Andy 's lack of attention to the toys , expressing joy when Andy touches him for only a few moments . When the toys are initially left for the garbage pickup , he is ultimately responsible for saving them when they use his tail to rip a hole in the garbage bag . He is initially happy to be at Sunnyside , and is visibly sad when Woody leaves , but becomes dismayed after a rough playtime with the toddlers , commenting `` Andy never played with us like that ! '' He is imprisoned along with Andy 's other toys by Lotso and his gang . Later , at the garbage dump , Rex is the last to escape the shredder , only barely escaping when he grabs onto a broken fan . He discovers a source of light thinking that it 's daylight , but Woody convinces him that it 's not ; it 's the light of the flame from the incinerator . When the toys are finally given to Bonnie , Rex becomes close friends with Trixie the Triceratops . </P> <P> In an outtake of Toy Story 2 , when used as a battering ram , Rex hurt his head when banged against the locked grate . Rex makes an appearance in an outtake of Monsters , Inc. where he waits at the crosswalk with Mike and Sulley in a scene reminiscent of Jurassic Park . Rex is a playable character in the Toy Story Racer video game . In the movie WALL - E , Rex is seen in the background inside WALL - E 's truck . </P> <P> Rex reappears in the theatrical short films Hawaiian Vacation , Small Fry , Partysaurus Rex and in the TV specials Toy Story of Terror ! , and Toy Story That Time Forgot . </P> Slinky Dog ( edit ) `` Slinky Dog '' redirects here . For the original toy , see Slinky -- Slinky Dog ( section ) . <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Jim Varney ( 1995 -- 1999 ) </Li> <Li> Blake Clark ( 2010 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Darryl Kurylo ( Toy Story Racer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Slinky Dog ( usually called just Slinky or sometimes Slink ) is a toy dachshund with a metal Slinky for a body , who speaks with a southern accent . Slinky 's head , feet , and tail are plastic and he is missing his pull string . Slinky also has a green collar . Slinky Dog is based on Slinky , a pull toy by James Industries , which was popular in the 1950s , 1960s and early 1970s . With the permission of James Industries , Slinky Dog was partially redesigned for the film by Pixar artist Bud Luckey to make him more appealing as an animated character . </P> <P> In Toy Story , he likes playing checkers with Woody , usually choosing the red side . Slinky is shown to be the most loyal to Woody and stands up for him when Potato Head complains . Slinky is fascinated by Buzz , along with the rest of the toys , but does not make fun of Woody when Buzz arrives like the others do . When Woody knocks Buzz out of the window , Slinky is one of the few toys who believes it was an accident . Later , when Andy notices Woody is missing , he and Bo Peep are worried about him , in contrast to the others , who are glad he 's gone . Later , he attempts to help when Woody throws a chain of Christmas lights from Sid 's house to Andy 's , but Potato Head stops him . Even Slinky appears to give up on Woody when he pretends Buzz is with him but accidentally reveals his broken arm . He is stretched almost to the point of breaking when helping rescue Woody and Buzz on the moving truck , but is fixed by the end of the film . </P> <P> At the beginning of Toy Story 2 , Slinky is the one who finds Woody 's hat , and joins Buzz , Hamm , Mr. Potato Head and Rex on a mission to rescue Woody from Al McWhiggin . His springy coil is used as a bungee cord when the toys jump from the roof of Andy 's house . When the toys break into Al 's apartment , Slinky uses his spring to hold Jessie and Bullseye back by coiling them up so the toys can safely rescue Woody . After Al packs up Woody and his Roundup gang and heads for the airport , Slinky , stretching down from the elevator ceiling by Buzz , Hamm and Potato Head , reaches for the case that contains Woody , and almost manages to save him , but is thwarted by the Prospector . While following Al to the airport on a pizza planet delivery truck , he operates the truck 's gas and brake pedals . They manage to reach the airport and use a pet carrier to get inside . When a girl approaches them ( mistaking the toys for a puppy ) , Slinky barks to scare her off to prevent their discovery . After rescuing Woody , they return home with the rest of the group in a stolen baggage carrier . In an outtake , he is seen petting his own hind section and talking to it . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , Slinky has a smaller role compared to the previous two films . He is the only original character that had to be re-cast ( due to Jim Varney 's death ) , and was replaced by Blake Clark ( with a professional Jim Varney voice ) in this film . Slinky is One - Eyed Bart 's `` Attack Dog with a Built - in Force Field '' and protects the bad guys with his shield in Andy 's western play sequence . At Sunnyside Daycare , Slinky has been tangled up by the young children . Later that night , Slinky reveals that Woody was telling them the truth about Andy 's intention to store the toys into the attic . Slinky and his friends are imprisoned by Lotso 's gang . He is shown to be the happiest toy to see Woody return , and assists him in subduing the Monkey toy who monitors the security cameras . When the toys reach the dumpster , Slinky stretches himself to create a bridge for the toys to climb across to safety , although they are stopped by Lotso . When the toys end up at the dump , Slinky is the first to be taken up by a magnetic ceiling due to the metallic section ( Slinky ) of his body . When Lotso betrays the toys and leaves them to be burned up in the incinerator , Slinky is the first to follow Buzz in joining hands in acceptance of their fate . After the toys are rescued by the Squeeze Toy Aliens , he and Hamm are the most vocal about wanting to get revenge on Lotso for leaving them to die before Woody convinces them Lotso is n't worth it . He is eventually donated to Bonnie along with the rest of the toys . </P> <P> His catchphrase , said in all three movies , is `` Golly bob - howdy ! '' </P> <P> Slinky reappears in the short film Hawaiian Vacation , in which he acts as a hotel porter as part of Ken and Barbie 's Hawaiian adventures . He also appears in Small Fry and Partysaurus Rex . He does not speak in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins , silently appearing along with Jessie in one scene . </P> Mr. Potato Head ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Don Rickles ( 1995 -- 2014 ) </Li> <Li> TBA ( 2019 ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Mr. Potato Head ( often referred to as simply Potato Head ) is a Brooklyn - accented doll based on the real - life toy Mr. Potato Head by Playskool . He is an outspoken and sarcastic potato - shaped toy : his patented design allows him to separate his detachable parts from his body by removing them from the holes on his body . He also has a compartment on his lower back to store extra appendages . He is capable of retaining control over his parts even if they are several meters away from his main body . For example , he can still see if one or both of his detachable eyes are removed , as well as being able to move his hands if they are detached . The same thing applies to his `` Mrs . '' counterpart , as she was able to see Andy in his room through her eye left behind . While this attribute is mostly used for comedic effect ( i.e. as a running gag , he often finds himself being split or falling apart due to outside forces ) , it does have its uses , particularly in the second and third films . </P> <P> In Toy Story , it is hinted that he used to be Andy 's favorite toy years before the events of the film , until he received Woody at the point of kindergarten , and therefore seems to have a strong jealousy towards Andy ` s love for Woody . Then , when Andy gets the Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday he becomes fascinated with all of Buzz 's features and ridicules Woody for not having a laser like Buzz as well as Woody 's pull - string . After Buzz is knocked out of the window , Potato Head ( perhaps due to his jealously towards Woody , and wanting to reclaim his long lost favorite toy position ) blames Woody for kicking him out , thinking that Woody might do the same to him if Andy plays with him more often , and turns the other toys against Woody and leads a mutiny with them . When Woody reveals himself at Sid 's House later , Mr. Potato Head convinces the others to refuse to help him , still assuming that Woody attacked Buzz . But when they are packed up Mr. Potato Head is still unhappy because he is stuck with Rex as a moving buddy and put in a moving truck . Later when Woody catches up with them and tosses RC onto the street to rescue Buzz , Potato Head , still distrusting Woody ( and perhaps still eager to reclaim his favorite toy position ) , orders the other toys to mutiny again , and `` toss him overboard '' , however , when Bo Peep reveals that `` Woody was telling the truth , '' the toys realize their mistake . He decides to reform himself as an apology to Woody by holding Slinky 's tail to help Woody and Buzz back at the truck but gets hit after Slinky 's attempt fails . When Woody tosses RC in the truck , Potato Head gets hit . At the end of the film , he is surprised to hear Molly receiving Mrs. Potato Head for her Christmas present and promptly decides to shave by removing his mustache . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , after Al McWhiggin steals Woody , he goes with Buzz , Hamm , Rex , and Slinky to rescue Woody . Later , when they are going to leave , Mrs. Potato Head packs some extra pair of shoes and angry eyes on his back compartment . When the toys cross the street to Al 's Toy Barn , they cause a semi to jackknife , and the chains restraining a large pipe on the semi break , freeing the pipe , which rolls down the street , during which Mr. Potato Head gets one of his feet stuck in a chewing gum and has to pull his foot off the gum before the pipe can crush him . After the toys break into Al 's room using Rex as a battering ram , Potato Head attempts to frighten Jessie by reaching into his back compartment for his angry eyes , but attaches his spare pair of shoes by mistake . When the toys leave the apartment after Al leaves with Woody , Potato Head throws his hat like a frisbee to jam the closing doors , letting the toys pass through . Outside , he is the first to spot an idling Pizza Planet delivery truck nearby . While the toys chase Al in the truck , Potato Head and Hamm operate the truck 's levers and knobs and are advised by three alien toys to pull the truck 's gear lever to get the truck to move . He later saves the alien toys from flying out the window . In the airport , when he sees the luggage area , he gasps and his angry eyes and pair of shoes come out after his compartment opens . He feels annoyed when the aliens repeatedly express their eternal gratefulness towards him , but after the toys return home in a stolen baggage carrier , he reluctantly gives in when his wife wants to adopt the aliens , much to his dismay . In an outtake , he is seen taking a dislike with the Barrel of Monkeys , saying he is `` drawing the line at monkeys '' and wants to call his agent . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , Potato Head is resentful of the aliens , who still worship him for saving their lives . Potato Head is sad that Andy does n't play with them anymore , and complains all that to Woody . He is frustrated that Andy `` threw them away '' , when he was actually going to put them in the attic . Again , Potato Head is the toy most doubtful of Woody when he and the other toys are almost thrown away by accident . Potato Head is excited to get played with in Sunnyside . After a rough playtime with the toddlers , he and Mrs. Potato Head 's parts are scattered on the floor , and he gets his parts stuck up a kid 's mouth and nose . Later that night , his wife Mrs. Potato Head through the other eye left in Andy 's bedroom , spots that Andy is looking for his toys , making Mr. Potato Head and the other toys shocked . When Lotso 's dark attitude is revealed , he tries to defend his friends from Lotso , but Big Baby throws him into `` The Box '' on Lotso 's orders . When Jessie told Woody she was wrong to leave Andy , Potato Head agrees saying that she was wrong . The toys hatch an escape plan which Potato Head initiates by arguing with and distracting the captors , and he is thrown in the box once again . Only his smaller parts are able to escape , through a small hole . He reassembles onto a floppy tortilla , checks if Lotso is sleeping and then gives the signal . Pecked at by a pigeon , the tortilla falls apart , and Potato Head rejoins the other toys using a cucumber for a body . Bullseye returns his original plastic body to him . The toys manage to escape Sunnyside , and he and the other toys jump onto a garbage truck . Eventually , they end up in a landfill , facing death in the incinerator . However , Potato Head and the toys are saved by his alien children , who he now accepts and declares himself to be eternally grateful , just as the aliens had told him when they met . They eventually return to Andy 's home and get washed . Mr. Potato Head then says his farewell to Woody before Andy comes into the room . Potato Head is donated to Bonnie at the end of the film . </P> <P> Potato Head reappears in the theatrical short films Hawaiian Vacation , Small Fry , and Partysaurus Rex , and appears in Toy Story of Terror ! and Toy Story That Time Forgot . Mr. Potato Head 's actor , Don Rickles , however died in 2017 so his voice actor is currently unknown for 2019 's upcoming film , Toy Story 4 . </P> <P> He is seen as an Interactive Audio - Animatronic at Toy Story Midway Mania ! . It is stated on the Toy Story website that Mr. Potato Head was Andy 's second toy . </P> Mrs. Potato Head ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Estelle Harris ( 1999 -- present ) </P> <P> Mrs. Potato Head is Mr. Potato Head 's wife and female counterpart . Unlike her husband , Mrs. Potato Head is sweet and not hot - headed or impatient . Although mentioned as one of Molly 's Christmas presents near the end of the first movie , she is not seen until Toy Story 2 . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , her husband has found her lost earring . Before her husband leaves with Buzz and his troops , she stores his `` extra pair of shoes and angry eyes '' into his back compartment . She also warns the toys by saying `` Do n't talk to any toy you do n't know ! '' She is not seen again until the end of the film . She becomes an adoptive mother of the three Squeeze Toy Aliens that Andy 's toys had found in the Pizza Planet truck , as they will not leave because Mr. Potato Head saved their lives . She is then happily watching Wheezy sing his version of `` You 've Got a Friend in Me '' with her husband . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , she has a more central role . She is `` One - Eyed Betty '' , One - Eyed Bart 's wife in the opening sequence . She uses her ninja skills and her nunchuk to herd Woody to the back , and eventually off the train . After One - Eyed Bart and Betty rob tons of gold , they are transported to Dr. Porkchop 's aircraft . At the present time when Andy 's toys all cram themselves in the toy box , Mrs. Potato Head loses one of her eyes . She is one of the toys who believe Andy threw them out on purpose . They are later donated to Sunnyside Daycare . She and her husband experience a rough playtime with the toddlers at the Caterpillar Room . When the toys hear something from the halls , Mrs. Potato Head uses her eye and looks under the door . She at first just sees the dark hall , but then she sees Andy looking for the toys in his room , due to the eye she left behind in Andy 's house . She tells the toys it truly was an accident that they were thrown away . When Lotso is revealed to be evil , Mrs. Potato Head complains about her chewed up pocketbook and yells at him when he calls her `` Sweet Potato , '' along with telling him she needs more respect and having over 30 accessories . But Lotso takes off her mouth . Near the end of the film , she is saved from death in an incinerator by her adoptive children , and much to her delight , her husband now accepts them . She recovers her missing eye before she and the toys are donated to Bonnie . Even though she was Molly 's Christmas gift in the first film , the second and third films imply that she is one of Andy 's toys . </P> <P> Mrs. Potato Head reappears in the theatrical short film Hawaiian Vacation and acts as a tour guide for Ken and Barbie in their Hawaiian adventures . She also reappears in Small Fry and Partysaurus Rex . </P> Bullseye ( edit ) <P> Vocal effects by Frank Welker ( 1999 -- present ) </P> <P> Bullseye is a toy horse who was introduced in Toy Story 2 . He is the first toy with which Woody interacted in Al 's penthouse . He was very happy to finally see Woody after a long time in storage . Bullseye is shown to loathe fights as he hides in a can when Jessie jumps on Woody . He is also upset at Woody 's intention to abandon the Roundup gang to return to Andy , as Bullseye does not want Woody to leave . When Woody ultimately decides to return to Andy 's room , it is Bullseye 's loyalty that causes Woody to try to get the other toys to join him . At the airport , after Bullseye escapes from Al 's case , Woody and Buzz Lightyear mount Bullseye and gallop across the airfield to rescue Jessie from being sent to Japan . Although Woody gets separated from Buzz , Buzz commandeers Bullseye to follow Woody , as they are seen galloping next to the wheels of the plane Woody and Jessie are on as it heads down the runway . The mission finally ends when Woody and Jessie swing down from the plane and land on Bullseye right behind Buzz , seconds before the plane takes off . After the toys return home , both Bullseye and Jessie become part of Andy 's toys . Bullseye has every letter of Andy 's name printed on the sole of each of his hooves . </P> <P> Bullseye returns in Toy Story 3 as one of the remaining toys in Andy 's room . He is still Woody 's horse in the opening sequence and saves him when he falls off the train by One - Eyed Betty . Bullseye 's fast speed helps Woody catch the train and rescue the orphans . Bullseye is really sad when Andy would n't play with them anymore . After Andy 's mother thought the bag that the toys were in was trash , Bullseye and the toys manage to safely hide in a recycling bin . The toys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare . At Sunnyside , he proves his loyalty to Woody when he makes clear he wants to stay with him . He only stays when Woody tells him to since Woody does n't want him to be alone in the attic . Bullseye is roughly tumbled over by a screaming toddler with a rolling wheel toy . After the toddler play session , Bullseye is covered with paint and has a blue sticker in his snout , which is removed by Jessie . When Lotso is revealed to be evil , he locks the toys up and shows them Woody 's hat , making Bullseye miss Woody and sad he 's gone . Bullseye is extremely happy when Woody comes back to Sunnyside and gives him back his hat . The toys then plan an escape . Bullseye helps by going through the playground , carrying the aliens on his back . He goes with Woody and is almost caught by Big Baby when Bullseye jumps and accidentally makes an alien fall and squeak . But they hide inside a pail safely . The toys then go to the garbage dump , and Bullseye is the most desperate to escape from the incinerator . They are rescued by the three aliens . At the end , Bullseye is donated to Bonnie , along with the rest of the toys . In Bonnie 's room Bullseye changes the channel of a radio to a Spanish channel causing Buzz and Jessie to dance to the Spanish version of `` You 've got a friend in me . '' </P> <P> Bullseye acts like a dog in many ways . Unlike most of the other toys , Bullseye can not communicate in clear speech but sounds like an actual horse and uses body language to speak . According to a character interview that used to be on the Toy Story website , Bullseye communicated with Jessie while in storage by tapping his hooves to yes or no questions . </P> <P> Bullseye reappears in the short films Hawaiian Vacation , Small Fry , and Partysaurus Rex . </P> Squeeze Toy aliens / Little Green Men ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Jeff Pidgeon ( 1995 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Debi Derryberry -- Toy Story </Li> <Li> Patrick Warburton -- Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins </Li> </Ul> <P> The Squeeze Toy Aliens , also known as Little Green Men ( or `` LGMs '' ) in the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command television series , are a series of green , three - eyed squeaky toy aliens . They appear in all three films , and some were among Andy 's toys after the events of Toy Story 2 . Similar to Buzz , they think they 're real aliens . Though it is not certain whether they are male or female at first glance , they are identified in the third film by Mr. Potato Head as `` ( his ) boys , '' implying that all three are male . </P> <P> In Toy Story , Buzz and Woody climb inside a giant rocket - shaped claw game at Pizza Planet . Inside the claw game are hundreds of squeeze toy aliens . When Buzz asks who is in charge , the Little Green Men say `` the claw '' , which belongs in the machine ; the Little Green Men say that the claw will `` decide who will go and who will stay '' . Sid spots Buzz inside the claw game and tries to win him . Woody attempts to save Buzz and escape through the claw game 's maintenance hatch , but the Little Green Men stop him and say that they must not fight the claw . Woody , Buzz , and a Little Green Man get taken to Sid 's house . Sid gives the Little Green Man to his dog , Scud , who violently chews it as Woody and Buzz watch in horror . Near the end of the movie , the same Little Green Man is seen to be intact , and it helps Woody try to scare Sid by getting out of Scud 's food bowl and walking like a zombie toward Sid . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , a trio of them are hanging above the dashboard in the Pizza Planet truck . Buzz groans when he sees them , remembering them from the claw game in the first film . When the toys are having trouble getting the truck to move , they tell Mr. Potato Head to `` use the wand of power '' ( the truck 's gear lever ) , which they mistook for the control lever of the giant claw game . They nearly fall out of the window , due to the sharp turns from Buzz trying to catch Al in his car . Fortunately , Mr. Potato Head saves them . The Little Green Men are thankful and hand him his ear . Throughout the rest of the movie they frequently say `` You have saved our lives , we are eternally grateful , '' much to Potato Head 's dismay . The Little Green Men join the quest to save Woody and mistake the entrance to the baggage area for the `` Mystic Portal '' . They chase after the luggage with Rex , Hamm , and Potato Head , only to find cameras . Back home , the trio , along with Bullseye and Jessie , end up becoming some of Andy 's toys . They say their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head , and Mrs. Potato Head is so happy that he saved their lives , so she suggests that they adopt them , with the Little Green Men calling Potato Head `` daddy '' . </P> <P> They reappear in Toy Story 3 as the `` henchmen '' under One - Eyed Bart and One - Eyed Betty , and serve as the getaway drivers during the western opening sequence and drive Barbie 's corvette . The car is destroyed by Buzz 's laser and they are transported to Dr. Porkchop 's aircraft . In the present time , the same trio continues to express their gratefulness to Mr. Potato Head . When Andy 's mother mistakes the trash bag containing them as trash , she puts the toys on the curb , but they manage to escape the garbage bag . They are donated to Sunnyside along with the rest of Andy 's toys . In Sunnyside , the Little Green Men find a toy crane , which reminds them of the claw game in Pizza Planet . The Little Green Men get sat on and bounced on during a rough playtime with the toddlers . The toys plan to escape Sunnyside . The Little Green Men have to go through the playground with Woody and ride on Bullseye . They almost get caught by Big Baby because one of the Little Green Men falls off Bullseye and squeaks , but manage to hide inside a pail . Later when Andy 's toys escape , one of the Little Green Men 's feet gets stuck in the lid of the bin at the bottom of the chute , possibly after being pulled by Lotso , who had been thrown in the bin by Big Baby . Woody goes in to help , but after he helps the Little Green Man , Lotso grabs Woody 's feet and pulls him into the bin just as the refuse truck arrives . The toys are collected by the truck and subsequently sent to landfill . The Little Green Men are separated from the others by a bulldozer when they wander off , having spotted a crane . Woody and Mrs. Potato Head yell and try to warn them , but they are presumed to be dead after being crushed by the bulldozer . In the end , however , they are revealed to have avoided the conveyor belt and later rescue everyone from an incinerator with a giant claw crane for which the Potato Heads finally acknowledges them as his children , reciting their repetitive line , `` You have saved our lives and we are eternally grateful . '' The trio are later delivered to Bonnie along with Andy 's other toys . </P> <P> The Aliens reappear in the theatrical short films Hawaiian Vacation , Small Fry and Partysaurus Rex . </P> Barbie ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jodi Benson -- ( 1999 -- present ) </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , when the toys discover Barbie dolls in an aisle while searching for Woody , Tour Guide Barbie volunteers to help them . During the end credits she is a cinema usherette and is seen giving out instructions to the audience . After a while she asks if everyone has gone and promptly stops smiling and complains that it hurts her face . She then leaves for her break . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , a Barbie appears to be one of the toys that Andy 's sister , Molly , owns . In Sunnyside , she falls in love with Ken , but after Lotso 's minions reset Buzz 's personality , and reveal that they want to sacrifice Andy 's old toys in order to protect themselves , she ingratiates herself with Ken in order to obtain the Buzz Lightyear manual that lets her friends reset Buzz to his original form . When she stands up to Lotso by saying that being treated fairly is better than living under his rule , Ken switches his allegiance to her and her friends . In the end credits of the film , they get back together and change Sunnyside , becoming its co-leaders , after Lotso is defeated . </P> <P> Barbie appears with Ken in Hawaiian Vacation . They sneak out of the daycare and stowaway in Bonnie 's backpack to go to Hawaii but Ken is disappointed to find out that Bonnie did n't take her backpack on her family vacation . The gang creates their own Hawaiian paradise to cheer Ken and Barbie up . They share their first kiss outside and then get trapped in the snow . </P> Sarge and the Bucket O ' soldiers ( edit ) <P> Voiced by R. Lee Ermey ( Sarge ) </P> <P> Sarge ( also known as Army Sarge and Sergeant ) is the gung - ho commander of an army of plastic toy soldiers from Bucket O Soldiers and loosely based on his voice actor 's role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket . </P> <P> In Toy Story , he and the Bucket O ' Soldiers are set in particular positions . They are highly disciplined with a `` Leave no man behind '' policy and are masters of reconnaissance . Woody describes them as `` professionals . '' The soldiers venture out of Andy 's room with one of Andy 's baby monitors ( while the other monitor resides in Andy 's room with Woody operating it ) and hide in an indoor plant to report Andy 's birthday presents to the toys and one of his comrades was injured after Mrs. Davis accidentally steps on one of them . They announced the first few presents to the other toys in Andy 's room through the monitors , but did n't get to tell them that Andy got a Buzz Lightyear action figure after Rex accidentally breaks the monitor . However , they were able to warn them that Andy and his friends are coming upstairs upon Woody fixing the monitor . Sarge and his soldiers thought Woody was a murderer when he knocked Buzz off the window , so they `` frag '' him and each one of them attack Woody , along with the other toys . In the moving van , the soldiers attack Woody when he pushed RC off the van , making Sarge and the toys think he 's murdering him now . However , Sarge sees that Woody knocking Buzz out the window was an accident , attempts to helps him on the van with the other toys , and is proud to work under Woody once again as shown at the end of the film when they hide in a Christmas tree and Christmas lights with the baby monitor to report to the toys what Andy and Molly are getting for Christmas . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , the role of Sarge is very minor . He first orders the soldiers to keep looking for Woody 's hat in the toy box . When Buster was about to come to the room , Sarge and his army held back the door ( with help from Rocky ) to prevent Buster 's entry , but Buster bursts open the door , causing the soldiers to go flying everywhere . When Woody alerts the toys about the yard sale occurring outside the house , he signals Sarge for an `` emergency roll call '' and Sarge orders the toys to line up in a single - file line . At the end , Sarge and his soldiers watch Wheezy sing `` You 've Got a Friend in Me . '' </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , several years after Toy Story 2 , only Sarge and two paratroopers are seen . Woody orders Sarge and his men to retrieve Andy 's cellphone . That plan , however , fails , and knowing that Andy is going to get out the garbage bag , Sarge and his last two men leave Andy 's room to find a better life . Buzz believes they are going AWOL , but Sarge claims that their mission is complete , and that when trash bags come out , the Army men are always the first to be thrown away ( it 's likely that the rest of the soldiers had either left prior to that day , or were sold in a yard sale ) . They appear again at the end of the film where they land in Sunnyside , and possibly recognizing Barbie , begin a happy new life under Barbie and Ken 's leadership . </P> Bo Peep ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Annie Potts ( 1995 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Rebecca Wink ( Toy Story Racer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Bo Peep is a porcelain figurine attached to Molly 's bedside lamp inspired by the heroine of the famed nursery rhyme ; a beautiful , sweet - natured shepherdess accompanied by a single figure merged to resemble three sheep , who serves as Woody 's romantic interest of the films . In spite of her status as one of Molly 's toys , like Mrs. Potato Head she may fall under the category of Andy 's toy . In Andy 's games of imaginative play she is used as the damsel - in - distress of the stories , and she is depicted as gentle , ladylike , and kindhearted . In the first film , after Woody 's exclusion from the group when Buzz Lightyear started to attract more attention , she remained loyal to him rather than taunting him because of Buzz 's rise in popularity . After Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out the window , she was one of the only toys who did not antagonize him . She continued to show her attraction to Woody in Toy Story 2 , flirting with him while playing a minor role . However , she did not return in Toy Story 3 , except in flashback footage , as , over the years , she had apparently been sold , much to Woody 's distress , like a few of the other characters . The particular reason for her disappearance was never disclosed officially , though Woody shows grief over her loss . In August 2015 , however , it was revealed that Bo Peep will have a major role in Toy Story 4 . The fourth film will focus on her relationship with Woody , along with Woody and Buzz trying to find and bring her back . </P> RC ( edit ) <P> RC is Andy 's remote controlled buggy . He has a green body with blue splash decals on the front . RC `` speaks '' with revving sounds , although Mr. Potato Head and the other toys can understand him regardless . RC is a playable character in Toy Story Racer . </P> <P> In Toy Story , RC was fascinated with Buzz 's features . When Woody becomes really jealous , he calls out to Buzz that there is a toy ( a magic 8 - ball ) trapped underneath the desk . Woody sneaks over to RC , starts him up , and tried to hit Buzz but misses . However , RC hits a board instead , causing thumbtacks on the board to fall and a globe to roll . Buzz falls out a window when the globe hits a red lamp and swings around and hits him . RC says to the other toys that Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out the window . RC then turns on Woody and thinks that he murdered Buzz . When Woody went to the moving van , he got RC out of the box and pushes him into the street and controlled him to rescue Buzz during the moving scene at the end of the film . </P> <P> After the toys mistakenly think that Woody is trying to get rid of RC , they toss Woody out of the moving truck into the street . RC finds Buzz hiding under the car in the streets and is thrilled to see him alive and well . Buzz controlled RC to catch Woody . Woody switched the remote to turbo mode to catch up with the truck , but RC 's batteries deplete , causing him to slow down and finally stop . When Woody lights the rocket taped onto Buzz 's back , Woody and Buzz hold onto RC as they rocket toward the truck , but the force of the rocket lifts Woody up from RC . Nevertheless , Woody manages to toss RC back into the truck ( knocking Mr. Potato Head apart in the process ) before he and Buzz go skyrocketing into the air . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , RC has a very minor role . He was used when Andy played with his toys . With Buzz riding him , he crashed into Evil Dr. Porkchop and knocked him down . He is not seen again until the end of the film , when he watched Wheezy sing `` You 've Got a Friend in Me '' . </P> <P> RC does not directly appear in Toy Story 3 , having seemingly been sold in a yard sale alongside a number of other toys .

He is about to be sold at the yard sale , and in saving him , Woody ends up falling so that he is stuck at the yard sale himself and subsequently stolen by Al . At the end of the film , he gets a new `` squeaker '' and sings `` You 've Got a Friend in Me , '' the ending theme of the movie . During the outtakes , he describes himself as `` not a good catcher '' as he fails to catch Mike 's microphone thus hurting himself several times . </P> <P> Wheezy does not directly appear in Toy Story 3 as he was sold in a yard sale after Toy Story 2 , as mentioned by Woody , but he does appear in footage of Andy as a boy ( Toy Story 3 ) .

Etch can draw quickly and accurately . Such sketches include guns , portraits of Buzz , Woody and Al , and even semi-complicated maps . This is his form of communication as he is unable to talk . </P> <P> In Toy Story , Woody compliments Etch 's art by saying that he has the fastest knobs in the west . He was also seen in the background many times , such as during the staff meetings and during Andy 's birthday and Christmas gift opening scenes . He became fascinated with Buzz during the middle of the film when he sketched a portrait of him . Angered by this , Woody erased it . He apparently , like most of the toys , temporarily believes Woody deliberately knocked Buzz out of the window ; he helps Mr. Potato Head threaten Woody by sketching a hangman 's noose . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , Etch was seen helping Hamm , Mr. Potato Head and the gang to identify Woody 's kidnapper , Al . Later on , when the toys were surfing channels to find the location on how to find Al 's Toy Barn , Etch is seen in the back as he was ready to draw a map for Buzz . Near the end of the movie , sometime before Andy comes back from cowboy camp , Etch , as well as the rest of the toys ( then including Jessie , Bullseye , and the Aliens ) , were aligned to welcome Andy home , with a `` Welcome Home , Andy '' sign written on Etch . </P> <P> Etch was sold in yard sale years after the second Toy Story , was mentioned by Woody , and only appeared in the archive footage of Andy as a kid in Toy Story 3 . </P> Mr. Spell ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jeff Pidgeon </P> <P> Mr. Spell is based on a popular 1970s Speak & Spell toy by Texas Instruments . He frequently holds or has held seminars on a variety of topics such as `` plastic corrosion awareness '' and `` what to do if you or part of you is swallowed . '' He also reveals the words he is saying . </P> <P> When Andy 's friends came to his birthday party , the toys panicked in thinking that they might be replaced with new toys and Mr. Spell , along with basically everyone else aside from Woody , ran to the window in panic to see the size of the presents . Then later , when Andy 's friends were running up to his room , Woody told everyone to go back to their places and the toys began to scatter and Mr. Spell can be seen in the overhead shot running in fright and then again behind Mr. Potato Head . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , when Buster finds Woody , Mr. Spell displays 13.5 , the amount of time in seconds it has elapsed for Buster to find Woody , setting a new record .

Chuckles explains that he , Lotso , and Big Baby were accidentally left behind on a trip with Daisy 's family , and when they finally made it back to Daisy 's house , both him and Lotso discovered that Lotso had been replaced , which caused Lotso to snap . Chuckles objected when Lotso claimed all three had been replaced , but Lotso silenced him , and lied to Big Baby , saying that Daisy did not love him anymore . After the three found their way to Sunnyside and Lotso took over , running it like a prison , Chuckles was damaged and Bonnie found him and took him home . He still feels sorry for what happened to Lotso , but knows that what Lotso is doing at Sunnyside is wrong .

One is Barbie without her original legs ( she has spare legs from a rag doll body ) , and the second is rag doll in violet bloom dress . A dark brown headless teddy bear is also seen with the dolls . It is because Sid tortured Hannah 's toys . Yet , she is able to play with them . `` Marie Antoinette '' is probably a nickname ( given by Buzz ) , based on their headlessness rather than the actual name of one of the toys . </Li> </Ul> Mutant toys ( edit ) <P> The Mutant Toys are mutilated toys who live their unhappy lives in the darkest corners of Sid 's room . They are assembled by Sid from mixed pieces of several toys that belong to him and Hannah ( hence the baby doll 's parts ) . They do not speak , though it is revealed they know Morse Code . Woody and Buzz initially think that they are cannibals who are going to eat them , before they learn that the toys are actually friendly and compassionate . They fix Buzz 's broken arm , Janie and the Pterodactyl , and also help Woody implement his plan to save Buzz from Sid . They close in on Sid as Woody tells Sid how much they hate being mutilated , and they all rejoice in victory after Woody frightens Sid away with his own voice . In Toy Story Treats , the Mutant Toys appear in Andy 's house . </P> <Ul> <Li> Baby Face -- The leader of the mutant toys , he is a one - eyed baby doll head staked on top of a spider - like body with crab - like pincers made of Erector set pieces . Baby Face lives in the shadows under Sid 's bed . One way Baby Face communicates with the other toys is by banging in Morse code on the side of Sid 's metal bedpost with his big claw . This method is used when he signals the other mutant toys to gather around to listen to Woody as he formulates his plan to rescue Buzz from Sid . When the mutant toys gain on Sid , Baby Face , suspended by Legs , lands on Sid 's head , scaring him . Baby Face is a playable character in the Toy Story Racer video game . </Li> <Li> Legs -- A toy fishing rod with Barbie doll legs . She is shown to be very strong , being able to hold Ducky 's and Baby Face 's weight . When Woody formulates his plan to save Buzz from Sid , he assigns Legs to partner up with Ducky . Legs opens the vent grating so she and Ducky can go to the front porch , where Legs lowers Ducky through the hole Ducky created so Ducky can swing toward the doorbell . After Ducky catches the Frog , Legs pulls both toys up to safety . Later , when the mutant toys advance on Sid , Legs lowers Baby Face onto Sid 's head , scaring him . </Li> <Li> Hand - in - the - Box -- Hand - in - the - box is based on the character Thing from the 1960s TV horror spoof The Addams Family . A green rubber arm that emerges from a black box , it appears to be based on the electro - mechanical coin - bank that was marketed as part of the show 's merchandising . During Woody 's plan to save Buzz from Sid , Hand - in - the - box , held by Rockmobile mounted on Babyface 's head , extends its hand to the doorknob , ready to open the door when the signal comes . After the Frog is let out the room to distract Scud , Hand - in - the - box mounts Roller Bob ( held by Rockmobile ) and extends its hand to pull Jingle Joe ( carrying Janie and the Pterodactyl ) when Woody motions the other mutant toys to go down to Sid 's backyard . The Hand also grabs Sid 's leg when the mutant toys surround him . </Li> <Li> Roller Bob -- A jet pilot action figure , whose torso has been attached to an old - school mini-skateboard .

A tin wind - up frog with two different wheels ( left is from an erector set and right is from a monster truck ) instead of back legs . The Frog is missing his left front foot . As part of Woody 's plot to rescue Buzz from Sid , Woody orders , `` Wind the Frog ! '' , and the Walking Car twists the wind - up key on the Frog 's back to provide energy . When Ducky rings the doorbell , the Frog is let out of Sid 's room , allowing Scud to chase him down the stairs and out to the front porch , where he is caught by Ducky , and Legs reels both toys up to safety . </Li> <Li> Jingle Joe -- The result of a triple toy combination . He is a Combat Carl head staked on top of a Melody Push Chime toddler toy with an arm which is missing from a Mickey Mouse figure . He appears at the part when he turns Woody 's flashlight off by pressing the button . He helps in the plan to save Buzz by supplying motion for Janie and the Pterodactyl when there is no room on Roller Bob . </Li> <Li> Ducky -- Another triple toy combination : a duck - headed Pez dispenser with a baby doll torso and plunger base . Other than Rockmobile , he is the only one of Sid 's toys that can communicate orally . He and Legs go to the front porch via the vent , and Ducky , suspended from the porch ceiling by Legs , swings toward the doorbell until he finally activates it , giving Woody the signal to release the Frog . Ducky catches the Frog as Legs reels both toys up to safety . </Li> <Li> Rockmobile -- A figure with an insect 's head who sits in a headless upper torso of Rocky Gibraltar , in which is a steering wheel from a toy car . Rockmobile also walks on the Rocky doll 's hands . </Li> <Li> Walking Car -- A yellow 1957 Austin - Healey 3000 car with small baby doll arms . He can run and climb very quickly . As part of Woody 's plot to save Buzz from Sid , when Woody orders to wind the Frog , the Walking Car twists the screw on the Frog 's back , giving the Frog enough energy to speed from Sid 's room to the porch . </Li> <Li> Janie and Pterodactyl -- Hannah 's beloved rag doll , Janie , and Sid 's creepy toy , a small plastic Pterodactyl , are the subjects of Sid 's last `` operation '' , called a `` double bypass brain transplant '' ( he ripped off their heads and replaced Janie 's head with a pterodactyl 's ) . The mutant toys later put their heads on the correct bodies . After the Frog is released from Sid 's room for Scud to chase after , Janie and the Pterodactyl ride Jingle Joe ( since Roller Bob has run out of capacity ) as Woody motions the toys to go down to Sid 's back yard . Janie has yellow hair and a striped dress . </Li> <Li> Red Pickup Truck -- a toy Toyota Hilux . It is a broken red pickup truck with crooked parts , missing ear windows and is covered in sand because it was abused and buried in the sandbox . It helps Woody and the other mutant toys rescue Buzz Lightyear from being blown up with a rocket by emerging from the sandbox along with Burned Rag Doll and Walking Car . </Li> <Li> Burned Rag Doll -- a one eyed rag doll that was possibly burnt in an explosion or fire . It repeatedly utters `` Mama ! '' , which signifies that it talks . It helps Woody and the mutant toys rescue Buzz Lightyear by coming out of the sandbox along with Walking Car and Red Pickup Truck . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Mason 's toys ( edit ) </H3> <P> Appearing in Toy Story That Time Forgot , these are the toys of Bonnie 's best friend Mason . </P> <Ul> <Li> Battlesaurs -- A group of mostly humanoid dinosaur toys who initially believe themselves to be real beings rather than playthings ( like Buzz in the first and third films , and Buzz 2 in the second film ) . This illusion is encouraged by Mason 's greater interest in a new videogame system that he received for Christmas , and they become hostile to Mason 's other toys and to Bonnie 's when they are brought over for a playdate . However , Trixie is eventually able to convince them that being played with brings its own joy , and they happily embrace their life as toys . <Ul> <Li> Reptillus Maximus ( voiced by Kevin McKidd ) -- The Carcharodontosaurus - like Champion of the Battlesaurs , who is fascinated by Trixie after meeting her . Initially , Reptillus is resistant to the idea of being a plaything , feeling that to submit to the will of his child would be surrender and dishonorable . However , Trixie later helps him to see that being there for Mason is honorable , and he helps her divert Mason 's attention to his new toys . Near at the end of Toy Story That Time Forgot it 's implied that he has a crush on Trixie . </Li> <Li> The Cleric ( voiced by Steve Purcell ) -- An anthropomorphic Ludodactylus and the `` spiritual '' leader of the Battlesaurs . The Cleric is the first Battlesaur shown to be aware of their status as toys , but conceals it from the others so that he can rule over them and Mason 's other toys . However , his plans are thwarted when Reptillus sides with Trixie ; he is later shown apparently enjoying his new role as Mason 's plaything . </Li> <Li> Ray - Gon ( voiced by Jonathan Kydd ) -- A Scelidosaurus who serves as the armorer of the Battlesaurs , his main contribution is providing Trixie and Rex with battle armor , with the latter featuring remote - control arms that the Cleric uses to manipulate Rex . </Li> <Li> Goliathon -- An Erythrosuchus that is kept as a pet by the other Battlesaurs and used to imprison their enemies in its belly . </Li> <Li> Guards -- Various guards are part of the Battlesaur collections , with raptor - like males and Parasaurolophus - like females amongst others . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Toy characters by location ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Al 's Toy Barn and apartment ( edit ) </H3> <P> Shown in a Buzz Lightyear commercial in Toy Story , this section contains characters from Toy Story 2 .

The Prospector doll seen in the film had never been opened and was still `` Mint in the Box '' making him sought after by thousands of collectors . </P> <P> In contrast to the character on the show , Stinky Pete is quite intelligent , manipulative , and well - spoken and , when he first appears , he seems to be a grandfather figure and mentor . However , he becomes embittered because he has never been sold or played with until Al McWhiggin eventually found him . Stinky Pete makes no secret of his hatred for space toys like Buzz Lightyear , whom he blames for causing the show to be canceled after the launch of Sputnik , causing children all over America to lose their interest in cowboy toys , shifting their interest to space adventures instead . </P> <P> Years after being purchased , Stinky Pete would spend years in storage while Al bought more toys and advertisements from Woody 's Roundup . After Al had stolen Woody , Stinky Pete and Jessie were excited because now they could go to the Konishi Toy Museum in Japan , where they will be treated with respect . Woody reveals that he has an owner named Andy Davis , which infuriates Jessie and leads the Prospector to become determined to make sure Woody does n't go back to Andy at any cost , despite the fact that he is now aware that Al actually has stolen Woody because he still belongs to Andy . </P> <P> When Al accidentally rips off Woody 's arm , Stinky Pete secretly leaves his box and he sabotages Woody 's attempt to recover his arm and return to Andy by turning on the TV . He then frames Jessie for this by putting the TV remote near her before returning to his box and pretending that he `` does n't know '' how the TV turned on after Woody falls for his trick . He later convinces Woody to wait until his arm is supposed to be fixed in the morning , which is done after Al calls in a cleaner . After Woody 's arm is fixed , Stinky Pete convinces Woody after a story that Jessie tells him about her old owner , that Andy wo n't play with him anymore by the time he goes to college , but in Japan , Woody will be treasured forever . Woody agrees to stay with them instead of going back to Andy , much to Stinky Pete , Jessie and Bullseye 's delight . </P> <P> However , Woody 's friends arrive during a celebration of going to Japan and they demand that Woody returns to Andy , but Woody angrily refuses , resulting in the toys sadly saying goodbye and leaving without him . However , before leaving , Buzz says an upset goodbye to Woody by saying that he 'll be staying behind glass forever and not being loved again if he chooses to go to Japan , leaving Woody to think over his choice . However , Woody has a change of heart and tells Buzz that he is coming with them , and invites his friends to come with him to Andy 's house . However , Stinky Pete is very angry with Woody for attempting to leave with Jessie and Bullseye back to Andy 's house , and once again he sabotages Woody 's attempt to escape by tightening the bolt to the vent ( as well as revealing to the others that he can actually get out of his box whenever he wants ) and uses his pick axe to turn off the TV , causing Woody to realize that it was the Prospector who foiled his escape the previous night by turning on the TV and framing Jessie for it . He sees unpopular toys like him and the Roundup Gang doomed to either always ending up in storage or `` spending a lifetime on a dime store shelf watching every other toy be sold , '' similar to his fate before Al found him , and does not want Woody , Jessie , and Bullseye to suffer the same fate . He also sees children as destroyers of toys whose ultimate fate will be `` spending eternity rotting in some landfill '' . This makes him all the more determined to go to the Tokyo museum and become an exhibit for the rest of his life , unlike Woody and Jessie . When Slinky attempts to get Woody out of Al 's suitcase , Stinky Pete quickly stops them and yanks Woody back in . </P> <P> When an angry Stinky Pete punches Buzz off the ramp at the airport to prevent Woody 's rescue , Woody confronts and fights Stinky Pete for harming his friend . Stinky Pete manages to overpower him , ripping his right arm in the process . He then attempts to finish Woody off after he refuses to get back in the case as told , assuring him that he will be fixed again in Japan while saying that going home will eventually end up with him being in pieces . The other toys blind and stun Stinky Pete with flash cameras that the toys found after they confused and mistook another green luggage case for Woody 's . Buzz , surviving the fall , captures Stinky Pete and Woody instructs Buzz and the other toys to dump Stinky Pete into a Barbie doll backpack that belongs to a little girl named Amy ( voiced by Debi Derryberry ) , who enjoys decorating her dolls ' faces with tattoos , as punishment and revenge for his betrayal , knowing it will make him learn the true meaning of playtime . Upon learning of Amy 's occupations of decorating her dolls , Stinky Pete starts to weep as he is taken to his new owner 's home . Ironically , this fate is a rectification of a past injustice done to Stinky Pete . Since much of his anger came from never being sold , opened or played with ; now he is finally being owned by a child after waiting 50 years . </P> <P> However , after the film 's release , the film 's website featured interviews with the characters . In Stinky Pete 's interview , he has reformed and said that he has become accustomed to Amy decorating him , as well of being fond of Amy herself . </P> <P> Despite his appearance , Stinky Pete does not appear in the third film , because he was no longer mentioned , though he seems to accurately predict the events of Toy Story 3 ( as what he had said after his defeat started to come true in the film ) . He asks Woody if Andy will take him to college , and later tells the rest of the toys that children destroy toys , which occurs in the Sunnyside Daycare , and that they will be forgotten and end up in a landfill permanently , where the toys are narrowly rescued from the incinerator after an escape attempt and return to Andy 's . The last part of his prediction did not come true . </P> <P> According to his box , Stinky Pete had a total of 9 sayings . In one outtake , Stinky Pete is seen talking to two Barbie dolls in the box , promising them a role in the third film . In another outtake , Stinky Pete gives Woody a choice to go back to Andy 's home or stay , until he suffers a bout of flatulence , which he later implies is the reason for his nickname . </P> <P> Despite the fact that he does not appear in the third film , Stinky Pete does appear in the Toy Box Mode of Toy Story 3 : The Video Game . </P> <P> According to the DVD commentary , the Pixar team had deliberated for a while what the proper comeuppance for the Prospector would be before it was decided for him to be placed in a Barbie bag with a face - painted Barbie . </P> Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Tim Allen </P> <P> When searching for Woody at Al 's Toy Barn , Buzz comes across the Buzz Lightyear aisle , causing him to stare in awe . While looking around , Buzz notices that there is a display case labeled `` New Utility Belt . '' Buzz then climbs up the display case to find a newer Buzz Lightyear with a Utility Belt . When Buzz tries to take the belt , the newer Buzz ( who thinks he is a real Space Ranger , similar to Andy 's Buzz in the original film ) springs to life and grabs him , believing him to be an AWOL Space Ranger . Buzz finds himself wondering out loud if he was this deluded , which Utility Belt Buzz mistakes for talking back and threatens to use his laser on him . Buzz tries to prove to him that he is not an actual Space Ranger by showing him that his laser is actually a light bulb . This does n't work however and Utility Belt Buzz jumps out of the way and tells him that he could 've killed him . Buzz then decides that he 's had enough and tries to leave , only for Utility Belt Buzz to jump out and attack him . After trapping Buzz in a box similar to the one he came in , he is mistaken for the original Buzz by the gang . When Rex mentions that he knows how to defeat Emperor Zurg -- having recently acquired a walkthrough guide for the Buzz Lightyear video game that he 's been stuck on , Utility Belt Buzz quickly decides to tag along thinking that the toys are trying to find Zurg . While the gang search Al 's Toy Barn and through the vents of Al 's apartment with Utility Belt Buzz , they become increasingly suspicious of his cocky attitude ( `` I 'm Buzz Lightyear ! I 'm always sure ! '' ) and strange actions ( such as thinking that he is flying up the elevator shift and is unaware that he 's standing on the elevator , which is helping him fly ) until they are finally reunited with Andy 's Buzz , who defuses his counterpart 's confusion by claiming that the situation is a ' Code 546 ' ( Precisely what this involves is unknown , but it prompted Utility Belt Buzz to refer to Woody as `` Your Majesty '' ) . </P> <P> Heading to the elevator on the way down , they encounter a savage Emperor Zurg toy and Utility Belt Buzz engages him in battle . When Utility Belt Buzz claims Zurg killed his father , Zurg responds he is his father , causing Utility Belt Buzz to scream in dismay ( a parody of The Empire Strikes Back ) . Rex defeats Zurg by accident , sending him falling off the elevator to his apparent doom by knocking him off - balance with his tail when he turns away as Zurg prepares to shoot Utility Belt Buzz , upsetting him . He is last seen playing catch with his `` father , '' the Zurg toy , whose attitude towards Utility Belt Buzz has changed after the fall . </P> Evil Emperor Zurg ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Andrew Stanton ( 1999 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Wayne Knight ( Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins ) </Li> <Li> Jess Harnell ( mini counterpart ) </Li> <Li> James Patrick Stuart ( Disney Magic Kingdoms ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Evil Emperor Zurg is a space villain action figure and Buzz Lightyear 's archenemy . He has red evil eyes with neon gritting teeth , silver horns on his head , a purple tunic with a black cape on it and his weapon , a gun ( which has a power control that , as a homage to This is Spinal Tap , goes to 11 ) . In some cases , he does not have a gun but a hand like the one on his other arm . </P> <P> In the first film , Zurg is a referenced character , and does not appear at all . However , Zurg is first seen in the opening sequence of the second film when Buzz is trying to take his main power away from him ( Zurg 's main power is from an AA battery which is actually revealed to be a hologram ) . In the ensuing battle , Zurg vaporizes the top half of Buzz Lightyear 's body with his gun , killing him . The sequence then cuts showing that the opening sequence was actually a video game played by Rex . </P> <P> As the story progresses , a Zurg toy in Al 's Toy Barn bursts out from its box and follows Andy 's Buzz Lightyear , who is on the way to rescue Woody from Al McWhiggin . Zurg is deluded , similar to Andy 's Buzz in the first film . In the second film , another copy of Buzz Lightyear , deluded in the same way as Andy 's Buzz in the first film , escapes from Al 's Toy Barn and battles with Zurg on top of an elevator . In a reference to the relationship of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader , the principal hero and villain respectively of the original Star Wars trilogy , Evil Emperor Zurg claims he is in fact the father of Buzz , in an almost word - for - word parody of the scene in The Empire Strikes Back . As Zurg attempts to finish off Buzz at point - blank range , Rex accidentally hits Zurg with his large tail and sends him falling down the elevator shaft . The second Buzz looks down the shaft in despair , thinking he has lost his father , while Rex is excited that he has finally managed to defeat Zurg in real life . Near the end of the film , Zurg is seen to have survived his fall with a bent horn and is now playing catch with the second Buzz . He supposedly bumped his head so hard that he forgot he was Buzz Lightyear 's worst enemy . In the novelisation , however , Zurg is killed by the fall , and Buzz finds him and takes him back to Al 's Toy Barn to bury him . </P> <P> Zurg is mentioned in the third film by Buzz in his bad guy character after Lotso resets him to Demo mode . Zurg appears briefly during a sequence in the end credits , where he is donated to Sunnyside Daycare center and greeted by the resident toys . </P> <P> Zurg also appears as in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and its direct - to - video movie Buzz Lightyear of Star Command : The Adventure Begins . Zurg says he is Lightyear 's father during a fight in order to shock Lightyear , before regaining the advantage during the fight and then denying the truth of that previous claim . Whether or not this is actually true , Buzz definitely does not know who his father is . This version of Zurg is also severely lightened up , going from the movie 's Darth Vader-esque version to a far less intimidating one ; in the TV series Zurg is a flamboyant villain who is just as much a comic relief character as he is a formidable opponent , similar to Skeletor . This Zurg is known for videotaping Buzz 's speeches , maintaining a troll doll collection , and various other comedic habits . He is shown to have a bit of a British accent throughout the series . It is revealed in the first episode that there is a Nana Zurg , but she is never seen at all ( although he claims that she 's `` plenty evil '' ) . Zurg would appear to be a cyborg of some description , also much like Darth Vader . However , it has also been discussed amongst fans that his `` cybernetic '' traits could also very well be because of advanced technology . There is yet to be a clear answer . In the TV series , he is the warlord - like ruler of an evil empire and is in command of an army of Hornet robots , as well of a minion workforce consisting of Grubs and Brainpods . The seat of which is the hellish Planet Z ( standing for Xrghthung ) . In various media surrounding the film , his planet is said to be called Xrghthung . However , because this is unpronounceable in the TV series it is changed to simply `` Z . '' It is unknown whether Zurg rules over any other worlds , but , if he does , they have not been revealed . Planet Z evidently possesses vast resources and forces enabling Zurg to be a serious threat to the Galactic Alliance . Despite being frequently gullible and bungling , Zurg is evidently highly intelligent , able to concoct sound military tactics and Machiavellian evil schemes . Additionally , he occasionally references stereotypes of typical evil villains and intentionally violates them , showing how aware he is of his similarity to them . For example , when designing a vast prison on Planet Z , he declines building an execution arena , for it simply `` gives the captives more time to get away . '' When he was designing a schematic for a new base , he expressly forbade for air vents that allow `` hero - sized objects '' into the control room . `` And , may I remind you , no giant trash compactor ! When heroes fall in , they always have enough time to figure a way out . Make it -- an incinerator ! '' </P> <P> Despite his camp nature , he is just as fearsome and ruthless as his movie counterpart . Zurg is frequently mentioned to be the most evil villain in the galaxy and appears to possess authority over all other villains . In fact , he would appear to be a physical manifestation of pure evil . He is particularly proud of this and frequently brags of how `` evil '' he is . He is a parody of Darth Vader on Star Wars , Darkseid on DC Comics , Ming the Merciless on Flash Gordon , Megatron on Transformers , Doctor Doom on Marvel Comics as well as The Six Million Dollar Man . </P> <P> Zurg appears as a playable character in Toy Story 3 : The Video Game on the PlayStation 3 in Toy Box Mode after completing several missions . He also has a convertible ( the ZurgsMobile ) that matches his personality . His mini counterpart is featured in the short Small Fry . </P> <P> Zurg appears in the 2015 live - action Disney movie , Tomorrowland . </P> Tour guide Barbie ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jodi Benson </P> <P> Tour Guide Barbie is a Barbie doll initially from Al 's Toy Barn in Toy Story 2 . When Hamm , Slinky Dog , Rex and Mr. Potato Head come upon the Barbie aisle at Al 's Toy Barn while searching for Woody , Tour Guide Barbie hops into the toy car they are driving . She gives the toys a tour in the toy barn and helps them locate Buzz Lightyear ( they actually find a different , ' limited - edition ' Buzz ) . After the outtakes of the film , Tour Guide Barbie waves goodbye to the audience until her face hurts from smiling . She then leaves for a break . </P> <H3> Sunnyside Daycare ( edit ) </H3> <P> These characters live at Sunnyside Daycare Centre . All appear in Toy Story 3 only . </P> Lots - O ' - Huggin ' bear ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Ned Beatty </P> <P> Lots - O ' - Huggin ' Bear ( Lotso for short ) is a plush , hot pink teddy bear with a big plum nose , a sweet strawberry scent and a southern accent , who uses a wooden toy mallet as an assistive cane ( although he is still able to walk even without it ) . He is the self - proclaimed leader of the toys at the Sunnyside Daycare Center . He initially acts like a kind - hearted and wise caretaker , but is eventually revealed to be a ruthless prison warden , although his backstory makes him more of a tragic villain . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , he welcomes Andy 's toys to Sunnyside and assigns them to the Caterpillar Room . Woody tries to escape from Sunnyside so he could go back to Andy , but is instead found and taken by a little girl named Bonnie . Woody learns from Chuckles , one of Bonnie 's toys , that Lotso was once owned and loved by a girl named Daisy , having become Daisy 's favorite toy when she obtained it for Christmas . Lotso became friends with Chuckles and Big Baby . One day , Daisy and her family had a picnic in the countryside . When she fell asleep , her parents drove her home , inadvertently leaving the toys behind . Not wanting to give up , Lotso led his two friends on a long trek back to Daisy 's house , only to discover that Daisy had gotten another Lots - O ' - Huggin ' Bear . Lotso became embittered and convinced Big Baby that they had been replaced , leaving Daisy 's home with Chuckles . Lotso eventually discovered Sunnyside Daycare Center and turned it into an internment camp for toys . Big Baby took on the role of Lotso 's enforcer , while Chuckles was broken , and was discovered by Bonnie and taken home . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Lotso realizes that Buzz is actually requesting a transfer of himself and the rest of Andy 's toys to the Butterfly Room . Thinking of Buzz to be useful to him , Lotso only approves the transfer to him . When Buzz refuses Lotso 's offer to stay in the Caterpillar Room , Lotso reverses Buzz to demo mode and manipulates him into imprisoning Andy 's other toys . </P> <P> When Woody and Andy 's toys attempt to flee from the daycare center . Lotso catches the group and once again offers them to stay at Sunnyside when a garbage truck arrives , but the toys refuse and Lotso instructs Stretch to push the toys into the dumpster . Woody argues with Lotso over his wrongdoings and reveals to him what he knows about Daisy and tosses Daisy 's ownership tag to him ; Lotso destroys it and says that toys are supposed to be discarded . His henchmen then turn on him and Big Baby throws him into the dumpster . As the toys attempt to flee , a vengeful Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects it to get the other toys to be sent to the dump . </P> <P> At the landfill , the toys end up on a conveyor belt leading to a shredder . Finding Lotso stuck under a large golf bag , Woody and Buzz rescue him and escape the shredder , only to realize that it leads to an incinerator . As they are about to reach the incinerator , Lotso sees an emergency stop button , and with Woody and Buzz 's help , manages to reach it . However , instead of pushing the button , he chooses to leave them behind , as he is still evil and selfish on the inside and still believes that all toys are meant to be at the dump . When Woody and the toys are rescued by the aliens , Hamm and Slinky want to get back at Lotso for leaving them to die , but Woody talks them out of it , claiming that `` he 's not worth it '' and that the dump is the right place for him . Lotso ( who is unaware the Andy 's toys are still alive ) is eventually found by a garbage man who recalls that he once had a Lots - O ' - Huggin ' Bear as a child , and straps Lotso to the grill of a garbage truck with three other toys before driving away . </P> <P> Lotso was intended to be in the first film ( originally for a sequel to Tin Toy ) , but the technology to design the fur to the proper consistency had yet to exist until Monsters , Inc. in 2001 , so he was saved for the third film . However , an early version of Lotso can be seen in the first film when Woody says `` Everybody hear me ? Up on the shelf , can you hear me ? Great ! '' and can be seen in the second film during the first Al 's Toy Barn Commercial . </P> <P> Test audiences who had sympathized with Lotso for his backstory had wanted him to push the button in the incinerator scene to redeem himself . However , according to the DVD commentary , director Lee Unkrich explained that Lotso not pushing the button to save the toys was intended for the audience to really care about the characters after three films of getting to know them when it looked like it was the end for them in the incinerator . The Pixar team took note of the people 's concerns and made Lotso to be an outright , selfish liar . </P> <P> Lotso also makes a cameo appearance in Pixar 's 2009 movie Up in a little girl 's room in the city where Mr. Fredricksen 's house goes by in the bottom left corner in the shadow of the bed . </P> <P> Ned Beatty was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for his performance as Lotso , and Pixar and he received widespread praise for the character 's back story and Beatty 's performance . IGN named Lotso the best villain of the summer of 2010 . </P> Ken ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Michael Keaton </P> <P> Ken is a smooth - talking doll who falls in love with Barbie . He first appears wearing light blue pleated and cuffed shorts , and a tucked - in leopard - print shirt with short sleeves . His accessories include matching ascot , sensible loafers and a fashion - forward gold belt . He lives in Ken 's Dreamhouse , a big yellow doll house with three stories , a large wardrobe room , and an elevator . Barbie originally breaks up with Ken when she finds him , Lotso , his other henchmen , and a reset Buzz Lightyear locking up her friends and discovering their ulterior motive . Piqued , Ken orders her locked up as well . </P> <P> However , as part of a plan to escape , she pretends to forgive Ken , gaining access to his dream house . Barbie then ties Ken hostage to try to get him to reveal how to reset Buzz back to normal . As a provocation , she entangles him in an ironing board and rips his clothing apart . Ken reveals the truth after she begins to sabotage his prized Nehru jacket . He is not seen again until Lotso has the toys cornered at the dumpster , where he is the first to turn on Lotso . Ken comes to Barbie 's help by trying to stop Lotso , having realized Barbie through her understanding of civics . Lotso tells Ken `` there 's 100,000,000 just like her '' , but Ken insists that for him , there is no one else like her , and wins back her affections . </P> <P> In the end credits of the film , he and Barbie are seen greeting new toys at Sunnyside as Barbie becomes his girlfriend again , and with Lotso gone , they both take charge of the Sunnyside toys as the new leaders . He resembles a real doll from 1988 called Animal Lovin ' Ken . Due to being called a `` girl 's toy , '' it is often joked about his femininity : such as his large selection and obsession with clothes , him wearing Barbie 's scarf , his rather feminine boxer - shorts , Bookworm not being suspicious seeing who he believed being Ken ( Barbie in a spacesuit outfit ) in high heels , as well as at the end Buzz believing Barbie wrote them the fancy note , only to discover Ken 's signature at the end . </P> <P> Ken , along with Barbie , appears in the theatrical short , Hawaiian Vacation , in which the two embark on a journey to Hawaii , but ends up in Bonnie 's room , where Woody and the other toys reenact various Hawaiian scenes . </P> Big Baby ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Woody Smith ( 2010 -- present ) </P> <P> Big Baby is a Bitty Baby doll with a lazy eye who carries around a bottle and is adorned with childlike scribbling that resembles ferocious tattoos . He normally does not speak , instead communicating through baby sounds , with the exception of one spoken line after the toys escape Sunnyside . Big Baby was once one of Daisy 's toys before he , Lotso , and Chuckles were lost at a rest area . After returning home , Lotso lied to Big Baby , claiming that Daisy replaced and no longer loved them . They eventually took over Sunnyside Daycare , where Big Baby became Lotso 's third - in - command . Eventually , Woody reveals to Lotso that Daisy still cared about them and gives Big Baby his pendant , sparking his memory of his former owner , whom he called `` Mama '' . Lotso derides Big Baby for his attachment to Daisy and smashes the pendant with his mallet . Big Baby turns against Lotso and throws him in the dumpster ( a parody of a scene from Return of the Jedi ) , blows him a raspberry , and helps Woody and his friends escape Sunnyside . </P> <P> In the credits , Big Baby is much happier at Sunnyside under Barbie and Ken 's care , and even wears gold diapers to match their outfits at a party at the daycare . </P> <P> The baby who provided the voice for Big Baby is named `` Woody , '' according to Lee Unkrich 's Twitter account , and the film 's credits confirm it as being Woody Smith ( listed under Additional voices ) . </P> Twitch ( edit ) <P> Voiced by John Cygan </P> <P> Twitch is a green `` insectaloid warrior '' action figure with a bug 's head , orange eyes with ferocious chomping mandibles , wings , and two muscular arms . He is one of the toy thugs working for Lotso . He helps to reprogram Buzz , and later apprehends Andy 's other toys . He keeps a search light working in the playground . He and Sparks `` break '' the Chatter telephone before he is convinced of Lotso 's evil by Woody and Ken . Because of how Lotso abused Big Baby , Twitch turns on Lotso , along with the other gang members . During the credits , he is seen living in a happier Sunnyside and is shown taking a turn to endure playtime with the young children in the Caterpillar Room , switching with Chunk so he can rest . </P> <P> Twitch is reminiscent of the 1980s `` He - Man and the Masters of the Universe '' toy line , and other similar lines . </P> Stretch ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Whoopi Goldberg </P> <P> Stretch is a toy rubber octopus with sticky suckers on her eight long arms and a glittery , purple body . She is the sole female member of Lotso 's gang , and at first welcomes the toys , but later helps capture them with her elastic tentacles . With her cohorts , she later catches Woody and his friends , and was eager to push them into the dumpster , should they not admit defeat . However , Stretch was also seen to be the first toy to doubt Lotso 's leadership and motives , as she was seen to visibly cringe at Lotso 's true character being revealed . After Lotso destroys Big Baby 's locket , he angrily orders Stretch to push Woody and his friends into the dumpster , which Stretch is now reluctant to do , causing Lotso to reveal his true feelings about all toys . Eventually , Lotso is thrown into the dumpster by Big Baby for his lies and treachery , and Stretch immediately leaves the area , shocked at what had happened but relieved . In the credits , she welcomes new toys happily without Lotso and is later seen sneaking a message to Woody and the gang in Bonnie 's backpack . She is based on a purple Wacky WallWalker toy from the 1980s . </P> Chunk ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jack Angel </P> <P> Chunk is an orange muscular rock monster toy . He has two red eyes when fierce , blue eyes when he 's friendly , huge fists , and a face that you can change by rolling it up or down to a different facial expression or pressing a button at the top of his head . He welcomes the toys to Sunnyside , but later helps Lotso and Buzz imprison them . He is then convinced of Lotso 's deception when he abuses Big Baby , and is seen helping Woody and his friends climb to safety . In the credits , he is seen taking the abuse of the younger children , later taking a rest while Twitch takes his place . He is based on the short lived Rock Lords toyline . </P> <P> Chunk has a very low level of intelligence : During a gambling scene , he describes Buzz as `` He ai n't the sharpest knife in the ... place ... where they ... keep the knives '' . He enjoys teasing Ken during the gambling scene since he called him a `` girl 's toy . '' </P> Sparks ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jan Rabson </P> <P> Sparks is a robot toy at Sunnyside Daycare . He has shown to be both blunt and sarcastic . Sparks ' retro design has flashing red LED eyes and a blaster cavity in his chest that spits out real sparks when he 's rolling around on his wheels , but is completely safe for children . He sports telescoping arms with working pincers and he can also elevate his body to make himself taller . He starts out as one of Lotso 's henchmen , but in the dumpster scene , when Ken states that Lotso put all of the toys in Sunnyside Daycare into a pyramid and placed himself on the top , he and Twitch ( and likely Chunk as well ) start to doubt Lotso 's leadership as both of them look at each other . Both of them are also in shock when Lotso shows his true colors and pokes Big Baby angrily in the stomach . They also witness Big Baby who retaliates by throwing Lotso into the dumpster , and he and the rest of his fellow henchmen let Andy 's toys escape . In the end , he and the rest of Lotso 's former henchmen reform for the better and become nicer . </P> <P> Sparks has only one line , when he points out Chunk 's low intelligence , he says , `` Neither are you , Chunk '' after Chunk gives his opinion on Buzz . </P> Chatter Telephone ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Teddy Newton </P> <P> Chatter Telephone is a character based on the real - life toy of the same name . He can only speak when his receiver is lifted from its cradle . He lives in the Caterpillar Room . He is the oldest toy at Sunnyside , and becomes an ally to Woody . When Woody returns to Sunnyside , he immediately says that coming back was a mistake because Lotso had rigged his security after he left and that the best action would be to just lay low . He reluctantly gives him instructions on how to escape Sunnyside . For this , he is later brutally beaten and broken for helping Woody and his group escape , and eventually rats Woody out when convinced that Woody and the other toys had already escaped , but are caught just before they can do so . He sadly apologizes to Woody who fortunately shows sympathy for the broken toy . In the credits , he has been repaired and now lives a happier life there at Sunnyside Daycare without Lotso , having been invited into the Butterfly Room . When Woody talked to him , he called him Ol ' Timer . </P> Bookworm ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Richard Kind </P> <P> The Bookworm is a green toy worm with a built - in flashlight who wears glasses . He is a genius who loves reading books . He keeps a library of instruction manuals in a closet at Sunnyside , and gives Lotso the instruction manual for Buzz Lightyear . He later gives the same manual to Barbie ( who he thinks is Ken since she is disguised in his spacesuit outfit ) . It is unknown if he is in allegiance with Lotso but is most likely not , since he is never seen with him very often . In the credits , he is happy without Lotso , and is seen using his flashlight to light a disco ball during a party at Sunnyside . He is based on the Glo Worm toys from the 1980s . He only has two lines in the film . </P> Cymbal - banging monkey ( edit ) <P> The cymbal - banging monkey is a monkey toy based on the Musical Jolly Chimp toy from the 1960s. he monitors the Sunnyside Daycare security cameras at night , and can alert Lotso and the gang of any toys attempting to escape by screeching into a microphone to broadcast over the intercom . Chatter Telephone tells Woody that he must get rid of the monkey before he and his friends can escape . Woody and Slinky manage to succeed in taking him down by wrapping him up in Scotch Tape and shutting him in a filing cabinet . In the credits , he is seen in a much happier situation , gently playing his clash cymbals while wearing star - shaped sunglasses . </P> <H3> Toys in other projects ( edit ) </H3> <P> The following toy characters were seen in other Toy Story projects : </P> Discarded Fun Meal Toys ( edit ) <P> Appearing in Small Fry , the Discarded Fun Meal Toys are toys that were discarded by children and have formed a support group in a storage room at Poultry Palace .

He lived with his mother and sister Molly , but left to go to college when he was 17 . However , his father is never seen or mentioned in the films . Toy Story 2 implies that Woody might be a hand - me - down toy , and when introducing the 2009 set of Toy Story collectibles , John Lasseter said `` We always imagined he was a hand - me - down to Andy from his father . '' </P> <P> In Toy Story , Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his 6th birthday party . Tension erupts between Buzz and Woody , who has always prided himself on being Andy 's favorite . Andy initially spends much more time with his new toy , but still has a special place in his heart for Woody . Thus , he becomes concerned when both toys go missing for a time , fearing they would be lost during his family 's move to a new house . </P> <P> In Toy Story 2 , Andy is only seen in the beginning and for a short while in the ending . During his appearances , it is clear that he still loves his toys very much . At the end of the film , Andy is pleased to have five new toys -- Jessie , Bullseye , and the three Squeeze Toy Aliens -- added into his collection . He marks them , as he has all his toys , with his name on the soles of their feet , or in Bullseye 's case , one letter of his name on each hoof . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , Andy is 17 and preparing to go off to college , intending to put most of his toys in the attic except for Woody , whom he initially plans to take with him . While he apparently has not played with his toys for some years and has given many of them away , he is still resistant to his mother 's suggestion to either donate or sell his remaining toys , referring to them as `` junk '' ( which the toys believe is what he truly thinks ) . When they go missing , however , he becomes upset and confused when he can not find them . Before he goes to college , Woody secretly puts the address of Bonnie ( the young daughter of a family friend ) on the box with the toys in it , causing Andy to come around to the idea of donating them . He passes them on to young Bonnie , who he realizes will look after his childhood playthings and gives them each their own introduction , stating the qualities that make each of them special . When Bonnie finds Woody in the box as well , Andy shows great reluctance to pass on his favorite toy , but ultimately relents , allowing the toys to stay together in an environment where they will be loved and played with . He spends time with Bonnie and the toys one last time before departing for college , and is noticeably sad when Bonnie has Woody `` wave '' to him . He then responds with a quiet `` Thanks , guys '' . </P> <P> According to Toy Story producer Ralph Guggenheim in a December 1995 Animation Magazine article , John Lasseter and the story team for Toy Story reviewed the names of Pixar employees ' children , looking for the right name for Woody 's owner . Davis was ultimately named after and based on Andy Luckey , the son of legendary animator Bud Luckey , Pixar 's fifth employee and the creator of Woody . Luckey has declined to publicly comment on the connection . </P> <P> In the DVD feature for Toy Story 3 on the voice cast , the Pixar crew remark that they were n't sure if Morris would want to do it or would sound right , and were ecstatic when they heard his voice on an answering machine , Morris was perfect for teenage Andy . </P> Bonnie Anderson ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Emily Hahn </P> <P> Bonnie Anderson appears in Toy Story 3 as one of the children who goes to Sunnyside Daycare . She becomes the owner of Woody , Buzz and the other toys at the end of the film . Although she has an active imagination and boisterous manner when playing with her toys , she is shy and withdrawn when she is around adults , but she quickly warms up to Andy , when he donates his toys to her . She finds Woody , who was trying to escape Sunnyside , takes him home , and plays with him . Woody is impressed by what he sees at her house and ultimately gets himself ( and all of Andy 's other toys ) donated to her . Andy briefly plays with her after handing over his toys , and tells her he needs someone `` very special '' to take care of them for him . </P> <P> In the short film Hawaiian Vacation , Bonnie goes on a vacation to Hawaii and leaves Barbie and Ken in her room . </P> Molly Davis ( edit ) <P> Voiced by : </P> <Ul> <Li> Hannah Unkrich -- Toy Story , Toy Story 2 </Li> <Li> Bea Miller -- Toy Story 3 </Li> </Ul> <P> Molly Davis is Andy 's younger sister , seen as an infant in the first film , a toddler in the second film , and as a preteen in the third film . Andy uses her crib as the town jail during playtime at the beginning of the first film , implying they are sharing a room . When the family moves later in the film , Andy and Molly get separate rooms , though Molly has plans to move into Andy 's presumably larger room once he leaves for college . In the first film , she slobbers on Mr. Potato Head and throws him from the crib , causing his parts to scatter and earning her the nickname `` Princess Drool '' from him . At the end of the film , she receives a Mrs. Potato Head toy for Christmas . In Toy Story 3 , she also owned a Barbie doll , which she donates to the daycare center as she was less interested in dolls and toys by that time and is now a preteen . </P> Mrs. Davis ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Laurie Metcalf ( 1995 -- present ) </P> <P> Mrs. Davis is Andy and Molly 's single mother . In the first film , she has brown hair and ties it in a ponytail . In the other two films , her physical appearance is noticeably different and instead of brown , she has blonde hair and leaves it down . Though presented as a loving mother to Andy and Molly , Mrs. Davis is actually a major ( though indirect ) threat to the toys , as she frequently asks Andy to throw out the toys he no longer wants . Mrs. Davis ' actions regarding the toys sets the plot in motion in all three films , though they are not malicious . In the first film , she purchases a Buzz Lightyear toy for Andy on his birthday , prompting the rivalry between Buzz and Woody which leads to them being lost and forced to find their way home . In the second film , she puts Wheezy up for sale at a yard sale ( due to a broken squeaker ) , prompting Woody 's rescue attempt where he is subsequently stolen by Al . In the third film , she orders Andy to clean out his room before going to college and mistakenly throws away the bag of toys Andy was putting in the attic , causing them to be donated to a daycare center . Despite this , in the second film , she is overly protective of Woody , describing him as an old family toy . At the end of the third film , she breaks down and weeps at the departure of her first son , but Andy reassures her that she will always be with him even if they are apart . This moment between mother and son plays a major factor in Woody deciding to have Andy donate his toys to Bonnie , thus giving them a new lease on their lives . </P> <P> Some 2014 articles explore the possibility that Mrs. Davis is Jessie 's original owner , Emily from her flashback memories . The evidence cited references the flashbacks of Jessie and Emily from Toy Story 2 . The flashback sequence shows Emily as a child in the 1960s , which is when she would have been a child . The sequence also shows that the cowboy hat that Emily had is very similar to Andy 's hat but with an additional white lace area , and Emily 's hair was brown , just like Mrs. Davis 's hair in the first film . </P> Sid Phillips ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Erik von Detten </P> <P> Sid Phillips is Andy 's neighbor until Andy moves , but it is unknown if he and Andy know each other . Sid is known for torturing and destroying toys . Many of his toys are either destroyed , have missing pieces , or replaced with parts from other toys , even Sid `` torturing '' Woody by burning his forehead with a magnifying glass . He is also shown tormenting his sister and destroying her toys by certain methods such as exploding , burning , and decapitating them . He also enjoys skateboarding , and his shirt depicts the logo for Zero Skateboards . The toys mention that he was consistently kicked out of summer camp ; and in the audio commentary on the tenth anniversary DVD , the directors mention that he is a bully but also the `` most creative character in the movie '' . It is also implied that he does not have the best home life . His parents do not make any major appearances : his mother 's voice is only heard briefly several times in the film , and his father is only seen briefly asleep on a chair in front of the TV in the living room . </P> <P> He also seems to be the only human depicted in the film to observe toys actually coming to life . At the end of the first film , Woody and Sid 's mutant toys decide to rescue Buzz by scaring Sid , which causes him to become very frightened of toys . The last straw is Woody coming alive and telling him to take good care of his toys or else . This causes Sid to panic and run back into his house screaming , and then to his room when his sister scares him with her toy doll . </P> <P> Sid does not appear in the second film , although he is mentioned once by Buzz during the toys ' mission to rescue Woody from the greedy toy collector Al McWhiggin . Sid also appears in the four - issue Monsters , Inc. comic mini-series produced by Boom ! Comics . </P> <P> In the third film , Sid ( now an adult ) makes brief appearances in two scenes once again voiced by Erik von Detten . He is shown to be a garbageman with a small beard , recognizable by his characteristic T - shirt . His only dialogue in this movie involves humming guitar riffs , and he is depicted listening to heavy metal music through a pair of large headphones . </P> Hannah Phillips ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Sarah Freeman </P> <P> Hannah Phillips is Sid 's sweet - natured , younger sister who appears a few times in the first film . In Toy Story , Hannah has adjusted to her toys being mutilated by Sid . Most of her dolls either have different heads or altered body parts , and at the end of the film she finds enjoyment in scaring her brother after he has been horrified by Woody and the other toys . She spends most of the time during the movie playing with her altered dolls . </P> Al McWhiggin ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Wayne Knight </P> <P> Al McWhiggin -- nicknamed `` The Chicken Man '' by Andy 's toys -- is the owner of a chain of local toy stores and also an obsessive collector of all things related to the old Woody 's Roundup TV series . He steals Woody from a yard sale held by Andy 's mother in hopes of selling him to a toy museum in Tokyo , Japan . He is unscrupulously obsessive , overweight , very impatient , and lazy , as he complains of having to `` drive all the way to work on a Saturday '' , despite his apartment only being across the street from the store . He is partially inspired by his voice actor Wayne Knight ; during the production of Toy Story 2 , Knight had a goatee like Al in the movie . Cartoonist and animator Scott Shaw has also been acknowledged as another model and inspiration for Al . </P> <P> Al is the owner of a large toy store called `` Al 's Toy Barn '' . The store is mentioned in the first Toy Story in an advertisement for Buzz Lightyear toys , but Al did not appear . He is first seen in Toy Story 2 during an advertisement on TV in which he is dressed up in a chicken suit of which Hamm remarks `` I despise that chicken '' after turning off the TV . He later is seen trying to buy Woody in a yard sale held by Andy 's mom . After Andy 's mother refuses to hand over the doll and locks him in a box , Al steals Woody with the intent of selling him , along with the rest of his collection of Woody 's Roundup toys and memorabilia , to a Japanese toy museum for a large sum of money . Andy 's toys arrived at his apartment to rescue Woody but Stinky Pete 's interference allow Al to leave for the airport with the Roundup Gang . Andy 's toys follow him there on a stolen pizza planet truck . ( In the original script , Andy 's toys steal Al 's car and Al steals the pizza planet truck and gives chase ) As Al 's plane is about to fly off to Japan with the Roundup Gang packed in the luggage , Andy 's toys are able to save Woody , Jessie and Bullseye , getting Jessie off of the plane at the last second , while the Prospector is placed in a little girl 's backpack for his betrayal . During his latest commercial soon after , Al is unable to control himself from hysterically sobbing over his losses as a result , which Hamm responded to by saying `` Well , I guess crime does n't pay . '' </P> <P> Al was originally conceived to appear in the first Toy Story film , but was cut in the final screenplay . However , Al 's Toy Barn makes an appearance in the first film during a television advertisement for Buzz Lightyear toys . </P> <P> Al 's last name was revealed on the nameplate on his office desk ; also , when he is done taking pictures , he answers his cellphone and Mr. Konishi can be heard saying his full name . According to Disney Adventures magazine , Al was not permitted to play with his toys when he was a kid , which led to his toy - collecting niche . It is implied that Al 's full name is actually Carl McWhiggin since Mr. Konishi is heard calling him that on the phone . </P> <P> His car 's license plate reads LZTYBRN , which is `` Al 's Toy Barn '' ( minus the vowel letters ) . It is also the actual license plate of Ash Brannon , co-director of Toy Story 2 , according to the Toy Story 2 : Special Edition commentary . </P> Mrs. Anderson ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Lori Alan </P> <P> Mrs. Anderson is the mother of Bonnie . She wears purple glasses . In Toy Story 3 , she is the receptionist at Sunnyside Daycare . When Andy comes to return his toys to Bonnie , Mrs. Anderson is amazed to see a grown - up college student donating his childhood toys to her daughter . During the credits scene , she carries another box of donation toys into the Butterfly Room at Sunnyside that contains Emperor Zurg . </P> <P> In Toy Story of Terror , she and Bonnie are driving in the countryside at nighttime when the car tire punctures . In the morning , the curtain behind the manager 's desk fell down revealing all her missing toys . Mrs. Anderson calls the police to arrest the manager who stole the toys . </P> Geri the cleaner ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Jonathan Harris </P> <P> Geri , an elderly specialist in toy restoration and repair with a fully loaded toy repair kit , comes to Al 's apartment in Toy Story 2 to fix Woody up in preparation for his trip to Japan . He insists that Al let him take his time with the work and views it as more than a simple job , asserting , `` You ca n't rush art . '' </P> <P> Geri previously appeared in Pixar 's 1997 short , Geri 's Game , where he plays a chess game against himself . In that short , he is voiced by Bob Peterson . One of the drawers in his carrying case contains chess pieces , a reference to the short . </P> Emily ( edit ) <P> Emily was the name of Jessie 's former owner and is mentioned by her in the second film . She appears in a flashback musical sequence while `` When She Loved Me '' by Sarah McLachlan is played . During this sequence , Jessie tells Woody of her first experience with an owner who was Emily and why she resented being a child 's toy . As a young child she was a fan of the Wild West and horses , along with the Woody 's Roundup TV show , apparent through her love of Jessie . As she became a teenager , her interest began to shift towards makeup , pop culture of the time and gossip with her friends which led to Jessie being neglected then thrown away through a donation box . She is mentioned by Jessie for the second time in the third film , when she fears of being thrown away by Andy , saying `` I should 've seen this coming ! It 's Emily all over again ! '' . </P> Daisy ( edit ) <P> Daisy is a little girl who appears in flashbacks in Toy Story 3 . She owned Lotso , Big Baby and Chuckles in the beginning , but accidentally left them behind at a rest area along the road . In order to pacify her , Daisy 's parents bought her another Lots - O ' - Huggin ' Bear rather than finding Lotso and the rest of her toys , which made Lotso think he had been replaced and forgotten about , and changed him into a sinister , ruthless toy . </P> Ron ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Stephen Tobolowsky </P> <P> Ron is the greedy manager of the Sleep Well Motel , appearing in Toy Story of Terror .

Ron then takes pictures of the toys and puts them on his bidding sale , awaiting buyers . Jessie manages to trick Mr. Jones into tearing off the curtain , revealing the toys ' location and Ron 's scheme to Bonnie and her mother , who then calls the police . </P> <P> Two police officers later arrive to question Ron , who attempts to escape by stealing their car but is forced to flee on foot after immediately crashing it into the motel sign . The police officers initiate a manhunt for him . </P> Mason ( edit ) <P> Voiced by R.C. Cope </P> <P> Mason is Bonnie 's best friend , and a post-Christmas playdate between the pair serves as the setting for Toy Story That Time Forgot .

However , due to Trixie and Reptillus ' efforts he abandons the video game and plays with his new toys . He is later shown to write his name on his toys in similar fashion to Andy and Bonnie . </P> <H3> Animals ( edit ) </H3> Scud ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Frank Welker </P> <P> Scud is Sid 's aggressive Bull Terrier . His viciousness is first demonstrated when Sid sets a Squeeze Toy Alien on his nose and commands him to maul it mercilessly . Scud serves as an obstacle for Woody and Buzz as they try to escape Sid 's house . First , as Woody tries to run off when Sid leaves the bedroom door open he encounters Scud sleeping and accidentally wakes him , forcing him and Buzz to hide . When Sid takes Buzz to the backyard to blow him up with a rocket , Woody tries to save him but Scud traps him in Sid 's room . The mutant toys help Woody distract Scud so they can rescue Buzz . Scud later spots Woody and Buzz trying to escape on the moving van and pursues them , but is eluded when he runs after them into the middle of a traffic intersection and is trapped by the cars as they crash while trying to avoid him . </P> Buster ( edit ) <P> Voiced by Frank Welker </P> <P> Buster is Andy 's pet dachshund , whom he receives at the end of Toy Story . Buster appears in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 . In Toy Story 2 , he is depicted as being very energetic . Buster is considered to be nice to the toys in Andy 's room and is the only one in Andy 's house who knows that the toys are alive , and is fiercely loyal to Woody , obeying all commands given to him by Woody : when Wheezy is taken by Andy 's mother to be sold at a yard sale , Woody is able to command Buster to carry him down to the yard sale so he can rescue Wheezy . However , he does not respond to commands from Andy whatsoever . Slinky is also able to communicate with him due to the fact they are both dogs . At the beginning of Toy Story 2 , Buster finds Woody in a record of 13.5 seconds . </P> <P> In Toy Story 3 , Buster is now older and looks very aged , with mixed brown and gray fur , a gray - white snout , overweight , and too old to help Woody save the other toys ( in a direct parody of the rescue scene from Toy Story 2 ) , although he remains nice and loyal to them . He tends to fall asleep as well . </P> Crazy Critters ( edit ) <P> Crazy Critters are a bunch of 2 - dimensional animal puppets from the Woody 's Roundup show including an armadillo , bat , bear , beaver , bird , deer , vulture , bear cub , porcupine , flying squirrel , rabbit , skunk , snake , fox , raccoon , tortoise and bobcat .

The song features vocals from English - Jamaican singer Rikrok . </P> <P> The lyrics of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend caught him having sex with another woman . His friend 's advice is to deny everything , despite clear evidence to the contrary , with the phrase `` It was n't me . '' </P> <P> `` It Was n't Me '' has been regarded as Shaggy 's breakthrough in the pop market , and is his highest - charting song to date , topping the charts in Australia , Austria , France , Ireland , the United States , the Netherlands , and the United Kingdom . It was the best - selling single of 2001 in the United Kingdom , selling over 1.15 million copies that year and over 1.42 million as of 2017 . The song was also featured on the 2001 compilation album Now That 's What I Call Music ! 6 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Chart performance </Li> <Li> 3 Music video </Li> <Li> 4 Legacy </Li> <Li> 5 Track listings </Li> <Li> 6 Charts and sales <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 6.2 Year - end charts </Li> <Li> 6.3 Certifications </Li> <Li> 6.4 Chart successions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> The lyrics of `` It Was n't Me '' depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman . His friend 's advice is to deny everything , despite clear evidence to the contrary , with the phrase `` It was n't me . '' Ultimately , the narrator says that the advice `` makes no sense at all '' . The song was inspired by a bit called `` No Loyal Men , '' performed by Eddie Murphy in his 1987 comedy special Raw . In a 2016 interview , Shaggy acknowledged similarities with the War song `` Smile Happy '' . The connection is further supported by Liam Payne 's 2017 debut single `` Strip That Down '' , itself based on `` It Was n't Me '' , which credited both Shaggy ( as Orville Burrell ) and members of War as co-songwriters . </P> <P> The clean version of the song replaces the lyric `` Picture this : we were both butt - naked banging on the bathroom floor '' with `` Picture this : we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor '' and `` Saw me banging on the sofa '' with `` Saw me kissing on the sofa '' . `` It Was n't Me '' was originally never intended to be released as a single . </P> <P> Before the original version of Hot Shot was released in August 2000 , Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from `` a Napster - like MP3 site he wo n't name '' and discovered that `` It Was n't Me '' was `` the album 's standout cut . '' He played the song on American radio the next day , and in an interview , claimed , `` The phone lines lit up right away . Within a couple of days , it was our number - one requested song . '' The song was then released as the album 's first single in September 2000 , following its radio success . The song is written in the key of C , in the Mixolydian mode . </P> <P> The song was spoofed by Bob Rivers , as Shaggy One Handed , making a reference to the Scooby - Doo character , Shaggy Rogers . The video focused on him being caught masturbating ( about the girl next door ) by his mother . The song was also spoofed on Svengoolie . On The Chris Moyles Show , the song was used as a prank call with Shaggy trying to book a taxi , with the final line being `` Can you drop me off at The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 ? , 97 to 99 FM '' . </P> <H2> Chart performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` It Was n't Me '' was Shaggy 's first number - one hit in the United States . The song peaked at number two for two weeks from December 16 , 2000 to December 23 , 2000 . On December 30 , 2000 , it was bumped down one position to number three . It moved back up to the number two spot on January 4 , 2001 . </P> <P> The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on March 4 , 2001 , selling 345,000 copies , making the song a transatlantic chart - topper . It also reached number one in Australia on April 1 , 2001 . It is also the 11th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the United Kingdom , with sales of over 1.42 million as of September 2017 . </P> <P> As of August 2014 , it is the 49th best - selling single of the 21st century in France , with 399,500 units sold . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> The music video was directed by Stephen Scott . </P> <P> It starts out with Rikrok running to Shaggy 's mansion to explain to him what has just happened . Rikrok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got caught . Shaggy tells him to tell her that `` It was n't me . '' The video then cuts into a flashback to earlier that day . Rikrok has been caught sleeping with another woman , and his girlfriend is outside the apartment in her convertible when two women pull up next to her on their motorcycles ( sport bikes ) . </P> <P> Then , the three women go into the building . He then sneaks out the window , takes the motorcycle of one of his girlfriends accomplices and leaves . The women come out and the girlfriend and one of the accomplices get in the convertible and the other gets on her motorcycle and they chase after him . From his mansion , Shaggy , using his futuristic technology , tracks down where Rikrok is going and prepares an escape for him . Rikrok then gets on a bridge over the highway when the accomplice rode on the bridge in front of him . </P> <P> He then hits the brakes to stop while she stops her motorcycle . Rikrok then hears a noise behind him and it 's the other accomplices and the girlfriend driving the convertible on the other side of the bridge with the highway down below . An eighteen - wheeler drives by , and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message telling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of overhead and lands on the truck . He is then dropped off at Shaggy 's mansion , showing the same scene from the start of the video . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The lyrics of `` It Was n't Me '' inspired Slate writer Josh Levin to coin the term the `` Shaggy defense '' to describe R. Kelly 's defence at his child pornography trial stemming from the production of a sex tape : `` I predict that in the decades to come , law schools will teach this as the ' Shaggy defense ' . You allege that I was caught on camera , butt naked , banging on the log cabin floor ? It was n't me . '' </P> <P> Levin repeated the term on NPR . The term describes a strategy of flatly denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence against the defendant , no matter how overwhelming . R. Kelly was ultimately found not guilty on all charges . </P> <P> The song is referenced by Trevor Noah on an episode of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah when he covered the vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine , as Pence vehemently kept denying his running mate Donald Trump 's claims , despite the fact that the claims have been proved to be said by Trump on camera or through his Twitter account . </P> <H2> Track listings ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> UK </Li> </Ul> <P> CD Single </P> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Vocal 12 '' Mix ) -- 3 : 49 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit ) -- 8 : 07 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Enhanced Video ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> </Ol> <P> Cassette single </P> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' -- 3 : 47 </Li> </Ol> <Ul> <Li> U.S. </Li> </Ul> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' -- 3 : 47 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Squeaky Remix ) -- 4 : 25 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Instrumental ) -- 3 : 47 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Sports Remix ) -- 3 : 27 </Li> </Ol> <Ul> <Li> Australia </Li> </Ul> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Vocal 12 '' Mix ) -- 3 : 49 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit ) -- 8 : 07 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Dancehall Version ) -- 3 : 46 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Enhanced Video ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> </Ol> <H2> Charts and sales ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2000 -- 01 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( ARIA ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Austria ( Ö3 Austria Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Wallonia ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada ( Nielsen SoundScan ) </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Denmark ( Tracklisten ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Europe ( Eurochart Hot 100 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Finland ( Suomen virallinen lista ) </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> France ( SNEP ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Germany ( Official German Charts ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ireland ( IRMA ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Italy ( FIMI ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( Recorded Music NZ ) </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Norway ( VG -

It is the largest non-diocesan Catholic high school in the United States . St. Francis is run by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn , who maintain a residence on the top floor of the school . The school has a student body of about 2,750 students and graduates between 600 and 700 students annually . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Co-curricular activities and athletics </Li> <Li> 3 Notable alumni </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> St. Francis Preparatory originated as St. Francis Academy , a small all - boys high school on 300 Baltic Street in Brooklyn , New York , founded by the Franciscans Brothers of Brooklyn ( O.S.F. ) . The college section became St. Francis College , a private predominantly undergraduate college in Brooklyn Heights . It took its current name in 1935 , then moved to a larger facility in Williamsburg , Brooklyn in 1952 . The school moved to its current location in Fresh Meadows , Queens in 1974 when it acquired the facility that formerly housed Bishop Reilly High School , a co-educational Catholic high school . The school began admitting female students that same year . A fitness center was added recently and the science labs are being updated . There are currently plans to add a three - story addition to the rear of the existing building . The upgrades to the art rooms will support students in the studio , digital and the performing arts . </P> <H2> Co-curricular activities and athletics ( edit ) </H2> <P> St. Francis Prep has a rivalry with Holy Cross High School , fueled particularly by their football teams . Known as the `` Battle of the Boulevard '' due to the two schools being located only 2 miles apart on Francis Lewis Boulevard , the rivalry between the Prep Terriers and the Holy Cross Knights has been called `` arguably the greatest rivalry in New York City football . '' </P> <P> The St. Francis Prep girls tennis team has been undefeated for 17 consecutive years , making them 17 time CHSAA champions . In 2015 the St. Francis Prep Varsity Handball team won their 13th consecutive CHSAA championship ( with an undefeated season ) . </P> <H2> Notable alumni ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Ted Alexandro , stand - up comedian </Li> <Li> Frank J.

The PRC has for several decades been synonymous with China , but it is only the most recent political entity to govern mainland China , preceded by the Republic of China ( ROC ) and thousands of years of imperial dynasties . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 1949 -- 1976 : Socialist transformation under Mao Zedong </Li> <Li> 2 1976 -- 1989 : Rise of Deng Xiaoping and economic reforms </Li> <Li> 3 1989 -- 2002 : Economic growth under the third generation </Li> <Li> 4 2002 -- present </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Historiography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> 1949 -- 1976 : socialist transformation under Mao Zedong ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the People 's Republic of China ( 1949 -- 1976 ) <P> Following the Chinese Civil War and the victory of Mao Zedong 's Communist forces over the Kuomintang forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai - shek , who fled to Taiwan , Mao declared the founding of the People 's Republic of China on October 1 , 1949 . Mao 's first goal was a total overhaul of the land ownership system , and extensive land reforms . China 's old system of landlord ownership of farmland and tenant peasants was replaced with a distribution system in favor of poor / landless peasants which significantly reduced economic inequality . Over a million landlords were executed . In Zhangzhuangcun , in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country , most `` landlords '' and `` rich peasants '' had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled . All formerly landless workers had received land , which eliminated this category altogether . As a result , `` middling peasants , '' who now accounted for 90 percent of the village population , owned 90.8 percent of the land . Mao laid heavy theoretical emphasis on class struggle , and in 1953 began various campaigns to persecute former landlords and merchants , including the execution of more powerful landlords . Drug trafficking in the country as well as foreign investment were largely wiped out . </P> <P> Mao believed that socialism would eventually triumph over all other ideologies , and following the First Five - Year Plan based on a Soviet - style centrally controlled economy , Mao took on the ambitious project of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 , beginning an unprecedented process of collectivization in rural areas . Mao urged the use of communally organized iron smelters to increase steel production , pulling workers off of agricultural labor to the point that large amounts of crops rotted unharvested . Mao decided to continue to advocate these smelters despite a visit to a factory steel mill which proved to him that high quality steel could only be produced in a factory . He thought that ending the program would dampen peasant enthusiasm for his political mobilization , the Great Leap Forward . </P> <P> The implementation of Maoist thought in China may have been responsible for over 40 - 70 million deaths including famine during peacetime , with the Great Leap Forward , Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957 - 58 , and the Cultural Revolution . Millions died from both executions and forced labour . Because of Mao 's land reforms during the Great Leap Forward , which resulted in massive famines , thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961 . By the end of 1961 the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition . Active campaigns , including party purges and `` reeducation '' resulted in the imprisonment or execution of those deemed to hold views contrary to Maoist ideals . Mao 's failure with the Leap reduced his power in government , whose administrative duties fell to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping . </P> <P> To impose socialist orthodoxy and rid China of `` old elements '' , and at the same time serving certain political goals , Mao began the Cultural Revolution in May 1966 . The campaign was far reaching into all aspects of Chinese life . Red Guards terrorized the streets as many ordinary citizens were deemed counter-revolutionaries . Education and public transportation came to a nearly complete halt . Daily life involved shouting slogans and reciting Mao quotations . Many prominent political leaders , including Liu and Deng , were purged and deemed `` capitalist - roaders '' . The campaign would not come to a complete end until the death of Mao in 1976 . </P> <P> Supporters of the Maoist Era claim that under Mao , China 's unity and sovereignty was assured for the first time in a century , and there was development of infrastructure , industry , healthcare , education ( only 20 % of the population could read in 1949 , compared to 65.5 % thirty years later ) , which raised standard of living for the average Chinese . They also claimed that campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were essential in jumpstarting China 's development and `` purifying '' its culture . Others claim that though the consequences of both these campaigns were economically and humanly disastrous , they left behind a `` clean slate '' on which later economic progress could be built . Supporters often also doubt statistics or accounts given for death tolls or other damages incurred by Mao 's campaigns , attributing the high death toll to natural disasters , famine , or other consequences of political chaos during the rule of Chiang Kai - shek . </P> <H2> 1976 -- 1989 : rise of Deng Xiaoping and economic reforms ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the People 's Republic of China ( 1976 -- 1989 ) <P> Mao Zedong 's death was followed by a power struggle between the Gang of Four , Hua Guofeng , and eventually Deng Xiaoping . Deng would maneuver himself to the top of China 's leadership by 1980 . At the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee , Deng embarked China on the road to Economic Reforms and Openness ( 改革 开放 Gaige Kaifang ) , policies that began with the de-collectivization of the countryside , followed with industrial reforms aimed at decentralizing government controls in the industrial sector . A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum , gave a `` preliminary assessment '' of the entire 30 - year period of Communist rule . At the plenum , party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution `` an appalling catastrophe '' and `` the most severe setback to ( the ) socialist cause since ( 1949 ) . '' The Chinese government 's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People 's Republic of China , adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China . This stated that `` Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary , strategist and theorist . It is true that he made gross mistakes during the `` cultural revolution '' , but , if we judge his activities as a whole , his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes . His merits are primary and his errors secondary . '' </P> <P> On the subject of Mao 's legacy Deng coined the famous phrase `` 7 parts good , 3 parts bad '' and avoided denouncing Mao altogether . Deng championed the idea of Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) , areas where foreign investment would be allowed to pour in without strict government restraint and regulations , running on a basically capitalist system . Deng laid emphasis on light industry as a stepping stone to the development of heavy industries . </P> <P> Supporters of the economic reforms point to the rapid development of the consumer and export sectors of the economy , the creation of an urban middle class that now constitutes 15 % of the population , higher living standards ( which is shown via dramatic increases in GDP per capita , consumer spending , life expectancy , literacy rate , and total grain output ) and a much wider range of personal rights and freedoms for average Chinese as evidence of the success of the reforms . </P> <P> Although standards of living improved significantly in the 1980s , Deng 's reforms were not without criticism . Hard - liners asserted that Deng opened China once again to various social evils , and an overall increase in materialistic thinking , while liberals attacked Deng 's unrelenting stance on political reform . Liberal forces began gathering in different forms to protest against the Party 's authoritarian leadership . In 1989 , the death of Hu Yaobang , a liberal figure , triggered weeks of spontaneous protests in the Tiananmen Square . The government imposed martial law and sent in tanks and soldiers to suppress the demonstrations . Western countries and multilateral organizations briefly suspended their formal ties with China 's government under Premier Li Peng 's leadership , which was directly responsible for the military curfew and bloody crackdown . </P> <P> Critics of the economic reforms , both in China and abroad , claim that the reforms have caused wealth disparity , environmental pollution , rampant corruption , widespread unemployment associated with layoffs at inefficient state - owned enterprises , and has introduced often unwelcome cultural influences . Consequently , they believe that China 's culture has been corrupted , the poor have been reduced to a hopeless abject underclass , and that the social stability is threatened . They are also of the opinion that various political reforms , such as moves towards popular elections , have been unfairly nipped in the bud . Regardless of either view , today , the public perception of Mao has improved at least superficially ; images of Mao and Mao related objects have become fashionable , commonly used on novelty items and even as talismans . However , the path of modernization and market - oriented economic reforms that China started since the early 1980s appears to be fundamentally unchallenged . Even critics of China 's market reforms do not wish to see a backtrack of these two decades of reforms , but rather propose corrective measures to offset some of the social issues caused by existing reforms . </P> <P> In 1979 , the Chinese government instituted a one child policy to try to control its rapidly increasing population . The controversial policy resulted in a dramatic decrease in child poverty . The law currently applies to about a third of mainland Chinese , with plans in place to ease it to a two - child limit . </P> <P> The achievements of Lee Kuan Yew to create an economic superpower in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China . They made a major effort , especially under Deng Xiaoping , to emulate his policies of economic growth , entrepreneurship , and subtle suppression of dissent . Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods . </P> <H2> 1989 -- 2002 : economic growth under the third generation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the People 's Republic of China ( 1989 -- 2002 ) <P> After the events at Tiananmen , Deng Xiaoping retired from public view . While keeping ultimate control , power was passed onto the third generation of leadership led by Jiang Zemin , who was hailed as its `` core '' . Economic growth , despite foreign trade embargoes , returned to a fast pace by the mid-1990s . Jiang 's macroeconomic reforms furthered Deng 's vision for `` Socialism with Chinese Characteristics '' . At the same time , Jiang 's period saw a continued rise in social corruption in all areas of life . Unemployment skyrocketed as unprofitable SOE 's were closed to make way for more competitive ventures , internally and abroad . The ill - equipped social welfare system was put on a serious test . Jiang also laid heavy emphasis on scientific and technological advancement in areas such as space exploration . To sustain vast human consumption , the Three Gorges Dam was built , attracting supporters and widespread criticism . Environmental pollution became a very serious problem as Beijing was frequently hit by sandstorms as a result of desertification . </P> <P> The 1990s saw two foreign colonies returned to China , Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 , and Macau from Portugal in 1999 . Hong Kong and Macau mostly continued their own governance , retaining independence in their economic , social , and judicial systems . </P> <P> Jiang and President Clinton exchanged state visits , but Sino - American relations took very sour turns at the end of the decade . On May 7 , 1999 , during the Kosovo War , US aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade . The U.S. government claimed the strike was due to bad intelligence and false target identification . </P> <P> Inside the US , the Cox Report stated that China had been stealing various top US military secrets . </P> <P> In 2001 , a US surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over international waters near Hainan , inciting further outrage with the Chinese public , already dissatisfied with the US . </P> <P> On the political agenda , China was once again put on the spotlight for the banning of public Falun Gong activity in 1999 . Silent protesters from the spiritual movement sat outside of Zhongnanhai , asking for dialogue with China 's leaders . Jiang saw it as threatening to the political situation and outlawed the group altogether , while using the mass media to denounce it as an evil cult . </P> <P> Conversely , Premier Zhu Rongji 's economic policies held China 's economy strong during the Asian Financial Crisis . Economic growth averaged at 8 % annually , pushed back by the 1998 Yangtze River Floods . After a decade of talks , China was finally admitted into the World Trade Organization . Standards of living improved significantly , although a wide urban - rural wealth gap was opened , as China saw the reappearance of the middle class . Wealth disparity between East and the Western hinterlands continued to widen by the day , prompting government programs to `` develop the West '' , taking on such ambitious projects such as the Qinghai - Tibet Railway . The burden of education was greater than ever . Rampant corruption continued despite Premier Zhu 's anti-corruption campaign that executed many officials . </P> <H2> 2002 -- present ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the People 's Republic of China ( 2002 -- present ) <P> The first major issue faced by China in the 21st century as a new generation of leaders led by Hu Jintao after assuming power was the public health crisis involving SARS , an illness that seemed to have originated out of Guangdong province . China 's position in the war on terror drew the country closer diplomatically to the United States . The economy continues to grow in double - digit numbers as the development of rural areas became the major focus of government policy . In gradual steps to consolidate his power , Hu Jintao removed Shanghai Party Chief Chen Liangyu and other potential political opponents amidst the fight against corruption , and the ongoing struggle against once powerful Shanghai clique . The assertion of the Scientific Perspective to create a Socialist Harmonious Society is the focus of the Hu - Wen administration , as some Jiang - era excesses are slowly reversed . In the years after Hu 's rise to power , respect of basic human rights in China continue to be a source of concern . </P> <P> The political status and future of Taiwan remain uncertain , but steps have been taken to improving relations between the Communist Party and several of Taiwan 's parties that hold a less antagonistic view towards China , notably former rival Kuomintang . </P> <P> The continued economic growth of the country as well as its sporting power status gained China the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics . However , this also put Hu 's administration under intense spotlight . While the 2008 Olympic was commonly understood to be a come - out party for People 's Republic of China , in light of the March 2008 Tibet protests , the government received heavy scrutiny . The Olympic torch was met with protest en route . Within the country these reactions were met with a fervent wave of nationalism with accusations of Western bias against China . </P> <P> In May 2008 , a massive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan province of China , exacting a death toll officially estimated at approximately 70,000 . The government responded more quickly than it did with previous events , and has allowed foreign media access to the regions that were hit the hardest . The adequacy of the government response was generally praised , and the relief efforts extended to every corner of Chinese life . In May and June 2008 , heavy rains in southern China caused severe flooding in the provinces of Anhui , Hunan , Jiangxi , Fujian and Guangdong , with dozens of fatalities and over a million people forced to evacuate . As of 2009 China has increased its internet monitoring capabilities by adding hundreds of new monitoring stations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of China </Li> <Li> History of the Republic of China </Li> <Li> History of Hong Kong </Li> <Li> History of Macau </Li> <Li> Dynasties in Chinese History </Li> <Li> Economic History of China </Li> <Li> Historiography of China </Li> <Li> History of Chinese Art </Li> <Li> History of Education in China </Li> <Li> History of Science and Technology in China </Li> <Li> Legal History of China </Li> <Li> Linguistic History of China </Li> <Li> Military history of China </Li> <Li> Naval History of China </Li> <Li> Timeline of Chinese history </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Stephen Rosskamm Shalom .

Collaborating with lyricist Don Black , it was written for the song cycle show Tell Me on a Sunday in 1978 . It was sung and released by Marti Webb in 1980 , and became a No. 3 hit in the UK charts . The song was also popular in Ireland , and spent six weeks at number one . Later , Tell Me on a Sunday was combined with another Lloyd Webber work , Variations , to form an entire new show , Song and Dance . </P> <P> The song is about a woman being told of her boyfriend 's infidelity . The woman denies this initially , before rebuking her newsbearer ( a girlfriend ) with the revelation that she `` knew before '' and had done for some time . She also spends much of the song criticising her friend for rushing to break the `` bad news '' to her . </P> <P> Despite having been written during the creative process for Tell Me on a Sunday , the song was n't recorded during the album 's principal sessions . Black reminded Lloyd Webber that they had missed a track , then entitled `` You Must Be Mistaken '' . John Mole , the bass guitar player , improvised a part reminiscent of the arrangement style of Phil Spector , inspiring the rest of the orchestration . The track was recorded in one take , apart from a double tracking of the orchestra . </P> <P> A briefer 3 : 02 edit of the song is included on the album , however , a longer 3 : 29 version remixed with greater dynamic range compression was released as the single . </P> <H2> Track listing ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Side A : `` Take That Look Off Your Face '' </Li> <Li> Side B : `` Sheldon Bloom '' </Li> </Ul> <H2> Revisions ( edit ) </H2> <P> The lyrics were substantially rewritten by Richard Maltby , Jr for the original Broadway production of Song and Dance . The British productions of the show have always used the lyrics written by Black . </P> <P> Black himself amended the line , `` He 's doing some deal up in Baltimore now '' after realising that Baltimore is south of New York . In subsequent versions , the song 's protagonist is said to be `` down '' in Baltimore . </P> <P> For the 2003 production of Tell Me on a Sunday , the storyline instead placed the action in England prior to an emigration to New York , requiring some further revision of the lyrics to reference London instead . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <P> </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This 1970s song - related article is a stub .

It is held in trust by The St Andrews Links Trust under an act of Parliament . The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews club house sits adjacent to the first tee , although it is but one of many clubs that have playing privileges on the course , along with the general public . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Governance </Li> <Li> 1.2 Influence on modern golf </Li> <Li> 1.3 Old Course and Bobby Jones </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Features </Li> <Li> 3 The Open Championship </Li> <Li> 4 Scorecard </Li> <Li> 5 Women 's British Open </Li> <Li> 6 Senior Open Championship </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Old Course at St Andrews is considered by many to be the `` home of golf '' because the sport was first played on the Links at St Andrews in the early 15th century . Golf was becoming increasingly popular in Scotland until in 1457 , when James II of Scotland banned golf because he felt that young men were playing too much golf instead of practising their archery . The ban was upheld by the following kings of Scotland until 1502 , when King James IV became a golfer himself and removed the ban . </P> <H3> Governance ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1552 , Archbishop John Hamilton gave the townspeople of St. Andrews the right to play on the links . In 1754 , 22 noblemen , professors , and landowners founded the Society of St Andrews Golfers . This society would eventually become the precursor to the Royal and Ancient which is the governing body for golf everywhere outside of the United States and Mexico . St Andrews Links had a scare when they went bankrupt in 1797 . The Town Council of St. Andrews decided to allow rabbit farming on the golf course to challenge golf for popularity . Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf . The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many years , though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in the 1850s and Old Tom Morris ( 1865 -- 1908 ) , who designed the 1st and 18th holes . Originally , it was played over the same set of fairways out and back to the same holes . As interest in the game increased , groups of golfers would often be playing the same hole , but going in different directions . </P> <H3> Influence on modern golf ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Old Course was pivotal to the development of how the game is played today . For instance , in 1764 , the course had 22 holes . The members would play the same hole going out and in with the exception of the 11th and 22nd holes . The members decided that the first four and last four holes on the course were too short and should be combined into four total holes ( two in and two out ) . St Andrews then had 18 holes and that was how the standard of 18 holes was created . Around 1863 , Old Tom Morris had the 1st green separated from the 17th green , producing the current 18 - hole layout with seven double greens and four single greens . The Old Course is home of The Open Championship , the oldest of golf 's major championships . The Old Course has hosted this major 29 times since 1873 , most recently in 2015 . The 29 Open Championships that the Old Course has hosted is more than any other course , and The Open is currently played there every five years . </P> <H3> Old Course and Bobby Jones ( edit ) </H3> <P> Bobby Jones ( who later founded Augusta National ) first played St Andrews in the 1921 Open Championship . During the third round , he infamously hit his ball into a bunker on the 11th hole . After he took four swings at the ball and still could not get out , after losing his temper , he continued the round , but did not turn in score card , thus disqualifying himself . However , he did continue to play in the fourth round . Six years later , when the Open Championship returned to St Andrews , Jones also returned . Not only did he win , he also became the first amateur to win back - to - back Open Championships . He won wire - to - wire , shooting a 285 ( 7 - under - par ) , which was the lowest score at either a U.S. Open or Open Championship at the time . He ended up winning the tournament by a decisive six strokes . </P> <P> In 1930 , Jones returned to St Andrews for the British Amateur . He won , beating Roger Wethered by a score of 7 and 6 in the final match . He subsequently won the other three majors , making him the only man in the history of the sport to win the Grand Slam . Jones went on to fall in love with the Old Course for the rest of his life . Years later , he said `` If I had to select one course upon which to play the match of my life , I should have selected the Old Course . '' In 1958 the town of St Andrews gave Jones the key to the city ; he was only the second American to receive the honour ( after Benjamin Franklin in 1759 ) . After he received the key , he said `` I could take out of my life everything but my experiences here in St. Andrews and I would still have had a rich and full life . '' </P> <H2> Features ( edit ) </H2> `` I 'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there . St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career . '' -- Jack Nicklaus on finishing his career at St Andrews , 2005 . The Swilcan Bridge is one of the most iconic attractions in golf The 18th hole towards the clubhouse of the R&A in 2006 . A largely unchanged view in 1891 . <P> One of the unique features of the Old Course are the large double greens . Seven greens are shared by two holes each , with hole numbers adding up to 18 ( 2nd paired with 16th , 3rd with 15th , all the way up to 8th and 10th ) . The Swilcan Bridge , spanning the first and 18th holes , has become a famous icon for golf in the world . Everyone who plays the 18th hole walks over this 700 - year - old bridge , and many iconic pictures of the farewells of the most iconic golfers in history have been taken on this bridge . A life - size stone replica of the Bridge is situated at the World Golf Hall of Fame museum in St. Augustine , Florida . Only the 1st , 9th , 17th and 18th holes have their own greens . Another unique feature is that the course can be played in either direction , clockwise or anti-clockwise . Along with that , the Old Course has 112 bunkers which are all individually named and have their own unique story and history behind them . The two most famous are the 10 ft deep `` Hell Bunker '' on the 14th hole , and the `` Road Bunker '' on the 17th hole . Countless professional golfers have seen their dreams of winning the Open Championship squandered by hitting their balls into those bunkers . </P> <P> The Old Course is also home of The Road Hole , the par - 4 17th , one of the world 's most famous golf holes . Among its unique features are : </P> <Ul> <Li> Players using the back tees can not see where their tee shots land . This is not unusual except that they must take aim over a corner of replica railway sheds which lie beyond the out of bounds wall . The original sheds were torn down when the rail line running next to the course closed , and after several Opens were played without the tee shot being blind , replicas of the sheds were created in preparation for the 1984 Open . </Li> <Li> Other than rough , the primary hazard in front of the green is a sand trap known as the `` Road Bunker . '' </Li> <Li> Over the back of the green , hazards include a tarmac roadway , as well as an old stone wall . Both are in play ; a wayward shot can lead a player to take their next stroke off the roadway or to hit the face of the wall and take their chances with the ensuing bounce . </Li> </Ul> <P> The general method of play today is counterclockwise , although clockwise play has been permitted on one day each year in recent years , and for several special one off events since . Originally , the course was reversed every week in order to let the grass recover better . One other unusual thing about the Old Course is that it is closed on Sundays to let the course rest . On some Sundays , the course turns into a park for all the townspeople who come out to stroll , picnic and otherwise enjoy the grounds . As a general rule , Sunday play is allowed on the course on only four occasions : </P> <Ul> <Li> The final day of the Dunhill Links Championship , an annual event on the European Tour . </Li> <Li> The final day of any R&A sanctioned Open Championships -- men and women , and the men over 50 when it is held at the Old Course ; this happens roughly once every five years for the men ; the women 's championship began its turn on the rotation in 2007 , and the over-50 championship began in 2018 . </Li> <Li> The final day of two top amateur events , the St Andrews Links Trophy and the St Rule Trophy . </Li> </Ul> <P> Sunday play may also occur when the Old Course hosts other major events ; for example , when it hosted the Curtis Cup in 2008 . </P> <P> While winning the Open Championship is a crowning achievement for any golfer , a win at St Andrews is considered particularly important due to the course 's long tradition . Past winners at St Andrews include Tiger Woods ( twice ) , Louis Oosthuizen , John Daly , Zach Johnson ( first Monday finish since 1988 ) , Nick Faldo , Seve Ballesteros , Jack Nicklaus ( twice ) , Tony Lema , Kel Nagle , Bobby Locke , Peter Thomson , Sam Snead , Dick Burton , Denny Shute , Bobby Jones , Jock Hutchison , James Braid ( twice ) , John Henry Taylor ( twice ) , Hugh Kirkaldy , Jack Burns , Bob Martin ( twice ) , Jamie Anderson , Tom Kidd , Lorena Ochoa , and most recently Stacy Lewis at the 2013 Women 's British Open . </P> <P> In 2005 the Old Course was ranked as the greatest golf course outside the United States , by Golf Digest . </P> <P> Since 1990 , the Old Course has been unique on the Open roster in holding the Championship every five years . However , this sequence has been broken with the announcement that the 2020 Championship will be at Royal St. George 's . The reason for this is that the 2021 Championship will be the 150th , and is expected to be played on the Old Course although no official announcement has yet been made . </P> <H2> The Open Championship ( edit ) </H2> The `` road bunker '' at the 17th hole .

Taylor </Td> <Td> 79 </Td> <Td> 77 </Td> <Td> 78 </Td> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 309 </Td> <Td> This open marked the first time the `` Great Triumvirate '' finished 1 - 2 - 3 . That was the name given to the three golfers who dominated the game in the late 19th century to the early 20th century . From 1894 to 1914 , J.H. Taylor , Harry Vardon , and James Braid combined to win 16 Open Championships . This was Taylor 's third of five Open Championships .

The winners share was £ 75 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1927 </Td> <Td> Bobby Jones ( a ) </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 72 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 72 </Td> <Td> 285 ( − 3 ) </Td> <Td> This win marked Bobby Jones ' first Open championship win at St Andrews , his second straight Open Championship , fourth professional major , and his 7th career major ( he was a three - time winner of the U.S. Amateur ) . As an amateur , Jones received no prize money . Aubrey Boomer and Fred Robson finished in a tie for second , and the winners and second place share of £ 75 for first place and £ 50 for second place were combined and divided into two , so each player earned 62 pounds and 10 shillings . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1933 </Td> <Td> Denny Shute </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 292 ( + 4 ) </Td> <Td> Shute won the Open title by five strokes in a playoff against Craig Wood .

The Royal Air Force used the fairways of the Old Course as runways . Burton held the Claret Jug the longest ( 7 years ) , until the tournament resumed in 1946 , also at St Andrews . The winners share was £ 100 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1946 </Td> <Td> Sam Snead </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 70 </Td> <Td> 74 </Td> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 290 ( − 2 ) </Td> <Td> Even though Sam Snead won the first Open Championship to be played since 1939 , he still lost money because of the high travel expenses ; his winner 's share was £ 150 . When taking the train into St Andrews , Sam Snead is quoted for looking out of the window and saying `` Say , that looks like an old abandoned golf course '' about the Old Course . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1955 </Td> <Td> Peter Thomson </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 70 </Td> <Td> 72 </Td> <Td> 281 ( − 7 ) </Td> <Td> This was the second of Thomson 's three straight Open titles , and five overall .

He survived a possible disqualification when he marked his ball on the 72nd green , and played his ball without replacing his ball mark . The R&A decided that because he had a three shot lead , and he did n't gain an advantage , that in the spirit of the game , he should not be disqualified . The winner 's share was £ 1,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1960 </Td> <Td> Kel Nagle </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 278 ( − 10 ) </Td> <Td> This was the 100th anniversary of the Open Championship , although due to wars it was n't the 100th Open Championship to be played . Arnold Palmer finished second and is credited with returning the Open to the eyes of Americans . The winner 's share was £ 1,250 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1964 </Td> <Td> Tony Lema </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 70 </Td> <Td> 279 ( − 9 ) </Td> <Td> From 1962 to 1966 , Lema won 12 times on tour , but this was his only major . He beat Jack Nicklaus by five strokes , and his winner 's share was £ 1,500 . Tragically , Lema and his pregnant wife were killed in a plane crash two years later . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1970 </Td> <Td> Jack Nicklaus </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 283 ( − 5 ) </Td> <Td> Doug Sanders missed a tough two and a half - foot ( 0.75 m ) putt on the 72nd hole , bogeyed , and ended up tied with Nicklaus . The playoff the next day came down to 18th hole and Nicklaus birdied to win ; it was his second Open title and eighth overall major ; the winner 's share was £ 5,250 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1978 </Td> <Td> Jack Nicklaus </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 72 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 281 ( − 7 ) </Td> <Td> Nicklaus completed the career Grand Slam ( winning all four majors in your career at least once ) for the third time making it his third Open Championship .

Ballesteros beat Bernhard Langer , Tom Watson , Fred Couples , Lanny Wadkins , Nick Faldo , and Greg Norman to make an epic final round at St Andrews . Ballesteros birdied the 72nd hole to win by two , and his fist pump is an iconic image to this day . His winner 's share was £ 50,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Nick Faldo </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 65 </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 270 ( − 18 ) </Td> <Td> Faldo set the Open championship scoring record shooting 18 under par , winning his second major of the year , his second Open Championship and his fourth overall major . The winner 's share was £ 85,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1995 </Td> <Td> John Daly </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 73 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 282 ( − 6 ) </Td> <Td> This Open was significant because it was the first that Tiger Woods played in , and the last that Arnold Palmer played in , getting to have his farewell at St Andrews . John Daly beat Costantino Rocca in a four - hole playoff to win the Open title and £ 125,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2000 </Td> <Td> Tiger Woods </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 66 </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 269 ( − 19 ) </Td> <Td> Winning the 2000 British Open was Tiger Woods ' second consecutive major championship , completing the career grand slam ; he would win the next two major championships as well for four consecutive major victories - the `` Tiger Slam '' . He did n't hit a single bunker the entire tournament , won by eight strokes , and set the new Open Championship scoring record with 19 under par . The winner 's share was £ 500,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2005 </Td> <Td> Tiger Woods </Td> <Td> 66 </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 70 </Td> <Td> 274 ( − 14 ) </Td> <Td> This was Jack Nicklaus 's last Open Championship and like Arnold Palmer , he finished on the Old Course . This was also Tiger 's 10th major championship and the fourth one he had won by five or more strokes , and the winner 's share was £ 720,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Louis Oosthuizen </Td> <Td> 65 </Td> <Td> 67 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 272 ( − 16 ) </Td> <Td> On the 150th anniversary of the first Open Championship , Oosthuizen played consistently well , winning the Open title by shooting a 16 under par 272 and winning by seven strokes . Rory McIlroy shot a 63 in the opening round and the winner 's share was £ 850,000 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2015 </Td> <Td> Zach Johnson </Td> <Td> 66 </Td> <Td> 71 </Td> <Td> 70 </Td> <Td> 66 </Td> <Td> 273 ( − 15 ) </Td> <Td> In the 144th playing of the Open Championship , Zach Johnson emerged from a three - man playoff to win the tournament . Tom Watson was given a special exemption by the R & A in order that he could finish his Open career at the Old Course . The tournament finished on Monday due to the extremely high winds that arose during Saturday 's round . Johnson defeated Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman in a four - hole playoff . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Note : Multiple winners of The Open Championship have superscript ordinal designating which in their respective careers . </Li> <Li> ( a ) denotes amateur </Li> </Ul> <P> Sources : </P> <H2> Scorecard ( edit ) </H2> Main article : 2015 Open Championship <Table> <Tr> <Th> Hole </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Yards </Th> <Th> Par </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Hole </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Yards </Th> <Th> Par </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Burn </Td> <Td> 376 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> Bobby Jones </Td> <Td> 386 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Dyke </Td> <Td> 453 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> High ( In ) </Td> <Td> 174 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Cartgate ( Out ) </Td> <Td> 397 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> <Td> Heathery ( In ) </Td> <Td> 348 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ginger Beer </Td> <Td> 480 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> Hole O'Cross ( In ) </Td> <Td> 465 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> Hole O'Cross ( Out ) </Td> <Td> 568 </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> <Td> Long </Td> <Td> 618 </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> Heathery ( Out ) </Td> <Td> 412 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> Cartgate ( In ) </Td> <Td> 455 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 7 </Td> <Td> High ( Out ) </Td> <Td> 371 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> <Td> Corner of the Dyke </Td> <Td> 423 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 8 </Td> <Td> Short </Td> <Td> 175 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 17 </Td> <Td> Road </Td> <Td> 495 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> End </Td> <Td> 352 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> Tom Morris </Td> <Td> 357 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Out </Td> <Td> 3,584 </Td> <Td> 36 </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> In </Td> <Td> 3,721 </Td> <Td> 36 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> Source : </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> Total </Td> <Td> 7,305 </Td> <Td> 72 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> Old Course <Tr> <Th> Tee </Th> <Th> Rating / Slope </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> 6 </Th> <Th> 7 </Th> <Th> 8 </Th> <Th> 9 </Th> <Th> Out </Th> <Th> 10 </Th> <Th> 11 </Th> <Th> 12 </Th> <Th> 13 </Th> <Th> 14 </Th> <Th> 15 </Th> <Th> 16 </Th> <Th> 17 </Th> <Th> 18 </Th> <Th> In </Th> <Th> Total </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> White </Th> <Th> 73.1 / 132 </Th> <Th> 376 </Th> <Th> 411 </Th> <Th> 370 </Th> <Th> 419 </Th> <Th> 514 </Th> <Th> 374 </Th> <Th> 359 </Th> <Th> 166 </Th> <Th> 347 </Th> <Th> 3336 </Th> <Th> 340 </Th> <Th> 174 </Th> <Th> 316 </Th> <Th> 418 </Th> <Th> 530 </Th> <Th> 414 </Th> <Th> 381 </Th> <Th> 455 </Th> <Th> 357 </Th> <Th> 3385 </Th> <Th> 6721 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Yellow </Th> <Th> 71.4 / 129 </Th> <Th> 355 </Th> <Th> 395 </Th> <Th> 337 </Th> <Th> 411 </Th> <Th> 514 </Th> <Th> 360 </Th> <Th> 349 </Th> <Th> 154 </Th> <Th> 289 </Th> <Th> 3164 </Th> <Th> 311 </Th> <Th> 164 </Th> <Th> 304 </Th> <Th> 388 </Th> <Th> 523 </Th> <Th> 391 </Th> <Th> 345 </Th> <Th> 436 </Th> <Th> 361 </Th> <Th> 3223 </Th> <Th> 6387 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Par </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 36 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 36 </Th> <Th> 72 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Ladies ' </Th> <Th> 75.6 / 138 </Th> <Th> 339 </Th> <Th> 375 </Th> <Th> 321 </Th> <Th> 401 </Th> <Th> 454 </Th> <Th> 325 </Th> <Th> 335 </Th> <Th> 145 </Th> <Th> 261 </Th> <Th> 2956 </Th> <Th> 296 </Th> <Th> 150 </Th> <Th> 304 </Th> <Th> 377 </Th> <Th> 487 </Th> <Th> 369 </Th> <Th> 325 </Th> <Th> 426 </Th> <Th> 342 </Th> <Th> 3076 </Th> <Th> 6032 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Par </Th> <Th> Ladies ' </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 38 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 5 </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> 38 </Th> <Th> 76 </Th> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Women 's British Open ( edit ) </H2> <P> Winners of the Women 's British Open at the Old Course at St Andrews : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Winner </Th> <Th> Score </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2007 </Td> <Td> Lorena Ochoa </Td> <Td> 287 ( − 5 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2013 </Td> <Td> Stacy Lewis </Td> <Td> 280 ( -- 8 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Senior Open Championship ( edit ) </H2> <P> Winners of the Senior Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Winner </Th> <Th> Score </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Golf in Scotland </Li> <Li> St Andrews Links </Li> <Li> The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` St Andrews Link Trust appointment '' .

It was held at Rosenblatt Stadium from 1950 through 2010 ; starting in 2011 , it has been held at TD Ameritrade Park Omaha . Earlier tournaments were held at Hyames Field in Kalamazoo , Michigan ( 1947 -- 48 ) and Wichita , Kansas ( 1949 ) . The name `` College World Series '' is derived from that of the Major League Baseball World Series championship ; it is currently an MLB trademark licensed to the NCAA . </P> <H3> Contract extension ( edit ) </H3> <P> On June 10 , 2009 , the NCAA and College World Series of Omaha , Inc. , which is the non-profit group that organizes the event , announced a new 25 - year contract extension , keeping the CWS in Omaha through 2035 . A memorandum of understanding had been reached by all parties on April 30 . </P> <P> The currently binding contract began in 2011 , the same year the tournament moved from Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha , a new ballpark across from CenturyLink Center Omaha . </P> <H2> Format History and changes ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dd> See also : NCAA Division I Baseball Championship § Past formats </Dd> </Dl> 2006 College World Series Championship game at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha , Nebraska . <Ul> <Li> 1947 -- Eight teams were divided into two , four - team , single - elimination playoffs . The two winners then met in a best - of - three final in Kalamazoo , Michigan . </Li> <Li> 1948 -- Similar to 1947 , but the two , four - team playoffs were changed to double - elimination tournaments . Again in the finals , the two winners met in a best - of - three format in Kalamazoo . </Li> <Li> 1949 -- The final was expanded to a four - team , double - elimination format and the site changed to Wichita , Kansas . Eight teams began the playoffs with the four finalists decided by a best - of - three district format . </Li> <Li> 1950 -- 1987 -- An eight - team , double - elimination format for the College World Series coincided with the move to Omaha in 1950 . From 1950 to 1953 , a baseball committee chose one team from each of the eight NCAA districts to compete at the CWS , which constituted the entire Division I tournament , as there were no preliminary rounds . ( In 1948 and 1949 , a selection committee in each of the eight districts chose its district representative based on the committee 's own criteria , which might or might not include committee selections , conference champions , and district playoffs . ) Through 1987 the College World Series was a pure double - elimination event . That ended with the 1987 College World Series . In 1954 , the Division I tournament began having preliminary rounds to determine the eight CWS teams . From 1954 to 1975 , the number of teams in the first round of the overall tournament ranged from 21 to 32 . The number of first - round teams was increased to 34 in 1976 , 36 in 1982 , 38 in 1985 , 40 in 1986 , and 48 in 1987 . </Li> <Li> 1988 -- 1998 -- The format was changed beginning with the 1988 College World Series , when the tournament was divided into 2 four - team double - elimination brackets , with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game . The single - game championship was designed for network television , with the final game on CBS on a Saturday afternoon . </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Before expanding to 64 teams in 1999 , the 1998 Division I tournament began with 48 teams , split into 8 six - team regionals . The 8 regional winners advanced to the College World Series . The regionals were a test of endurance , as teams had to win at least four games over four days , sometimes five if a team dropped into the loser 's bracket , placing a premium on pitching . In the last two years of the six - team regional format , the eventual CWS champion -- LSU in 1997 and Southern California in 1998 -- had to battle back from the loser 's bracket in the regional to advance to Omaha . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> 1999 -- 2002 -- With some 293 Division I teams playing , the NCAA expanded the overall tournament to a 64 - team Regional field in 1999 -- with 8 National Seed teams ( the top 8 seeds ) -- divided into 16 four - team regionals ( each region seeded 1 to 4 ) . The winners of the 16 `` Regionals '' advance to a second round , consisting of 8 two - team , best - of - three - format `` Super Regionals '' . ( The National Seed teams that win their regional bracket are placed in different Super Regionals , so that no National Seed teams meet each other in a Super Regional . ) The 8 Super Regional winners advance to the CWS in Omaha . While the CWS format remained the same , the expanded field meant that the eight CWS teams now are determined by the second - round Super Regionals . The 64 - team bracket is set at the beginning of the championship and teams are not reseeded for the CWS . Since the 1999 College World Series , the four - team brackets in the CWS have been determined by the results of super-regional play , much like the NCAA basketball tournament . Prior to 1999 , the four - team brackets were determined by the regional tournaments . </Li> <Li> 2003 -- present -- The championship final became a best - of - three series between the 2 four - team bracket winners , with games scheduled for Saturday , Sunday , and Monday evenings . In the results shown below , Score indicates the score of the championship game ( s ) only . In 2008 , the start of the CWS was moved back one day , and an extra day of rest was added in between bracket play and the championship series . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Division I champions by year ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Champion </Th> <Th> Coach </Th> <Th> Score </Th> <Th> Runner - Up </Th> <Th> Most Outstanding Player </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1947 </Td> <Td> California </Td> <Td> Clint Evans </Td> <Td> 17 -- 8 , 8 -- 7 </Td> <Td> Yale </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1948 </Td> <Td> Southern California </Td> <Td> Sam Barry </Td> <Td> 3 -- 1 , 3 -- 8 , 9 -- 2 </Td> <Td> Yale </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1949 </Td> <Td> Texas </Td> <Td> Bibb Falk </Td> <Td> 10 -- 3 </Td> <Td> Wake Forest </Td> <Td> Tom Hamilton , Texas </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1950 </Td> <Td> Texas </Td> <Td> Bibb Falk </Td> <Td> 3 -- 0 </Td> <Td> Washington State </Td> <Td> Ray VanCleef , Rutgers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1951 </Td> <Td> Oklahoma </Td> <Td> Jack Baer </Td> <Td> 3 -- 2 </Td> <Td> Tennessee </Td> <Td> Sidney Hatfield , Tennessee </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1952 </Td> <Td> Holy Cross </Td> <Td> Jack Barry </Td> <Td> 8 -- 4 </Td> <Td> Missouri </Td> <Td> James O'Neill , Holy Cross </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1953 </Td> <Td> Michigan </Td> <Td> Ray Fisher </Td> <Td> 7 -- 5 </Td> <Td> Texas </Td> <Td> J.L.

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . </P> <P> The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . </P> <P> An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Casting </Li> <Li> 2 Character history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Name </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Death </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Casting ( edit ) </H2> <P> During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . </P> <P> They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . </P> <H2> Character history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . </P> <P> The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . </P> <P> In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . </P> <P> On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom . </P> <P> Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . </P> <P> Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . </P> <P> In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . </P> <P> In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . </P> <P> The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . </P> <P> The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . </P> <P> In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger . </P> <P> In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door . </P> <P> In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date . </P> <P> In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . </P> <H3> Name ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> See also : Last Forever <P> In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . </P> <P> A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood is approximately,at sea level ( 765 mmHg ) in arterial blood is between 35 mmHg and 45 mmHg,"Blood gas tension - wikipedia <H1> Blood gas tension </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> Blood gas tension refers to the partial pressure of gases in blood . There are several significant purposes for measuring gas tension ; the most common gas tensions measured are oxygen tension ( P O ) , the carbon dioxide tension ( P CO ) and carbon monoxide tension ( P CO ) . The subscript x in each symbol represents the source of the gas being measured ; `` a '' meaning arterial , `` A '' being alveolar , `` v '' being venous , `` c '' being capillary .

Born Hermes Katsopolis ( as revealed in the season five episode `` The Legend of Ranger Joe '' ) , he was named after his great - grandfather , who in turn is named after the Greek god of swiftness . However , he did not like his birth name , as other kids teased him for it ; so when he was in kindergarten , he begged his parents to have his name changed to Jesse , thinking that one had to have a `` cool name '' to be in the in - crowd . As an adult , he was more confident with his true name , telling the girls about the Greek god of speed , and how his great - grandfather saved a village from a volcano , but still goes by Jesse . </P> <P> In contrast with Danny , Jesse is portrayed as being irresponsible most of the time , but occasionally serves as a responsible adult when a responsible adult is needed ( such as when he discovers Stephanie 's classmate is a child abuse victim in the season 6 episode `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) . Jesse is revealed as a high school dropout in season six 's `` Educating Jesse '' , though in an earlier plot ( in season four 's `` One Last Kiss '' ) about a high school reunion , he mentions not wearing his cap to his graduation because he did not want to mess up his hair . </P> <P> Jesse 's obsession with his hair becomes a major trait of his throughout the series , as well as his obsession with Elvis Presley . His obsession with the former is fully established in the season two premiere `` Cutting it Close '' , which focuses on Jesse 's tough time coping when Stephanie accidentally cuts off a hunk of his mullet , which leads to him getting into a motorcycle accident that lands him in a full arm cast ; later episodes reveal that he has a special comb called Mr. Goodpart ( which gets damaged in a melee to purchase a Mighty Mutant Super Kids Super Fortress for Michelle in season eight 's `` I 've Got a Secret '' ) and that he gives pep talks to his hair ( as revealed in season seven 's `` Wrong - Way Tanner '' ) . </P> <P> Jesse first moves into the house with virtually no experience in taking care of young children or babies , but starts to learn the ropes along the way . He becomes closer to all of his nieces over the course of the series , especially Michelle , whom he affectionately nicknames `` munchkin '' and `` shorty '' , among others . In the first season , Jesse works for his father Nick 's exterminating business before leaving to pursue work in advertising , frequently working with Joey . He later works with Joey as co-hosts of an afternoon drive time show on local radio station KFLH called The Rush Hour Renegades . Further along in the series , in season seven 's `` Smash Club : The Next Generation '' , Jesse becomes the new owner of The Smash Club . Although he was shown to be a sports fan as well as a good athlete in the earlier seasons , it is revealed in later seasons that Jesse hated all sports ( especially basketball , as revealed in `` Air Jesse '' from season eight ) and was not very athletic . Jesse 's main passion is music , and struggles to `` hit it big '' with his band , Jesse and the Rippers ( in the earlier part of the series ) . However , his increasing responsibilities to his family , radio job , and as owner of a club , lead his band members to kick him out of the band ( in the season eight premiere `` Comet 's Excellent Adventure '' ) ; in `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' , he briefly decides to quit being a musician until he has a nightmare in which he appears on Downbeat ( a Behind the Music - style show - within - a-dream - sequence ) has him dream that his family hates him , Rebecca has divorced him ( and moved on with Joey ) and Jesse himself was a mechanic , as well as overweight and balding ( because of a scalp infection ) , with Kimmy Gibbler ( dressed in the attire of the Married ... with Children character Peggy Bundy ) as a wife . Two episodes later in `` To Joey , With Love , '' he subsequently starts a new band called Hot Daddy and the Monkey Puppets . </P> <P> In Fuller House Jesse , Becky , and Danny all move to Los Angeles . Jesse becomes the music composer for General Hospital while Becky and Danny start a new nationally syndicated talk show called , Wake Up USA . In the season two finale , Jesse and Becky adopt a baby girl whom they name Pamela after his sister . Somewhere along the line Jesse became a stay at home dad . When Becky and Danny get fired from Wake Up USA , they try to get their old jobs back but the station only wanted her back to co-host an all women 's talk show . Jesse , Becky and Pamela are all moving back to San Francisco , and he also bought back the Smash Club ( which is now a laundromat ) along with Joey . </P> <H3> Danny Tanner </H3> <P> Daniel Ernest `` Danny '' Tanner ( portrayed by Bob Saget , John Posey in the unaired pilot ) is left with three young daughters to raise after his wife , Pam , dies in a car accident caused by a drunk driver . At the beginning of the series , he works as a sportscaster for Channel 8 News . In the season two episode `` Tanner vs. Gibbler '' , he is chosen by his station 's general manager Mr. Strowbridge to be the co-host for the station 's new morning talk show , Wake Up , San Francisco , alongside Rebecca Donaldson . In season one 's `` The Big Three - O , '' Danny 's beloved car , `` Bullet , '' is severely damaged after another driver rear - ends the vehicle , leading it roll out of park and become submerged in the San Francisco Bay as Jesse and Joey shop for new seat covers for the car to surprise Danny with as a present for his 30th birthday ; Jesse and Joey end up bidding for a new car that is identical in appearance , unknowingly competing with Danny , who purchases the car ( and later named it `` Walter '' ) after he calls the car dealership that Jesse and Joey are and places a bid over the phone . </P> <P> Danny goes on his first date since his wife 's death in the season one episode `` Sea Cruise , '' as part of a fishing trip that was intended to only include himself , Jesse and Joey ; he is seen going out on dates on select occasions throughout the series . While Rebecca goes on maternity leave in season five just before giving birth to his nephews Nicky and Alex , Danny ends up falling in love with her co-host replacement , Vicky Larson . The two of them begin dating in season five 's `` Easy Rider , '' becoming Danny 's most serious relationship since he became a widower , and the two later become engaged in the season six finale `` The House Meets the Mouse '' . However , their relationship turned into a long - distance situation as Vicky was assigned various reporting jobs away from San Francisco . In season seven 's `` The Perfect Couple , '' Vicky ended up getting her dream job of anchoring the network news in New York City , but a long - distance relationship did not work for either of them , so Danny decides to break up with her ; this leads him to a mass feng shui habit in the following episode , `` Is It True About Stephanie ? , '' to which his family acknowledges was his way of trying to cope with his breakup . Danny eventually meets fellow single parent Claire Mahan in season eight episode `` Making Out Is Hard to Do , '' and go on a date in the episode `` Claire and Present Danger . '' </P> <P> Although he is not established with this trait early on ( season one 's `` The Return of Grandma '' depicts him as begrudgingly trying to clean the messy house with Jesse and Joey after their mothers threaten to move in if they can not keep the place clean ) , much of the humor surrounding Danny 's character comes from his obsession with cleaning and cleanliness . Danny can often be found cleaning for cleaning 's sake , sometimes even cleaning his cleaning products ( in a version of the original season three opening titles , seen during episodes in which Lori Loughlin does not appear as Rebecca Donaldson , Danny is even shown to be cleaning his floor vacuum with a handheld vacuum ) . He says the family motto is `` clean is good , dirt is bad '' . Danny views spring cleaning as his equivalent to Christmas and home movies as his New Year 's Eve ( as revealed in the season two episode `` Goodbye , Mr. Bear '' ) . His quirkiness and generally `` unhip dad '' personality are also targets for humor . He is a skilled pool , dart player and guitarist ( as respectively revealed in season four 's , `` Girls Just Wanna Have Fun , '' and season eight 's , `` To Joey , with Love '' ) . </P> <P> Like most other characters , he generally can not stand Kimmy Gibbler , considering her as `` an annoying , obnoxious nuisance '' ; at times , urging D.J. to make new friends whenever Kimmy does something that irritates him . Danny also has one brother and one sister , and his parents are divorced . Unlike his brother - in - law Jesse ( who is more into rock - and - roll ) , Danny has a taste for 1970s Disco music ; one of his favorite songs is `` Play That Funky Music '' by Wild Cherry . </P> <P> In the first episode of Fuller House , Danny and Becky relocate to Los Angeles for their new talk show , Wake Up USA , and it is revealed that Danny got remarried to a woman named Teri . During the second season Danny goes through a little bit of a mid-life crisis since he just turned 60 . In season three Danny reveals that him and Teri got divorced . Danny and Becky asked for raises on their show but since they asked for too much they are fired and replaced by Mario Lopez . After feeling sorry for themselves they go back to Wake Up San Francisco to ask for their old jobs back but the station only wants Becky back . To cheer him up , the girls somehow tracked down Vicky and surprised him with her . He invites her to the 30th `` Dadiversary '' party the girls threw for him , Jesse and Joey . Since Becky , Jesse and Joey are all moving back to San Francisco , Danny announces he 's moving back too , and back into the house . </P> <H3> Joey Gladstone </H3> <P> Joseph Alvin `` Joey '' Gladstone ( portrayed by Dave Coulier ) is the childhood best friend of Danny Tanner , and adulthood best friend of Jesse Katsopolis . Joey moved in with Danny shortly after the death of Danny 's wife , Pam , to help raise D.J. , Stephanie , and Michelle . Joey works as a stand - up comedian , whose act usually includes vocal imitations of cartoon characters such as Popeye , Bullwinkle J. Moose , Pepé Le Pew and others . Joey initially slept in the alcove of Danny 's living room . However , after complaining of not being able to find privacy , Danny reconstructs his basement garage into a bedroom for him in the season one episode `` Joey 's Place '' ( prior to the reveal , Joey contemplates moving out after the family 's behavior makes him believe that Jesse and Danny can handle taking care of the girls and that he is not needed ) . Joey nearly quits comedy in the season one episode `` But Seriously , Folks , '' after Phyllis Diller ( who was there as an audience member ) hogs his slot at a comedy club , deciding to change his name to Joe and become a serious businessman . He reverses his decision after D.J. decides to quit practicing the guitar , realizing that he is not setting a good example . Although there was some tension between Joey and Jesse when they first move in with the Tanners , they quickly become good friends to the point where Jesse asks Joey to be his best man at his wedding . Even so , Joey 's perceived immaturity does irritate Jesse at times . Joey usually handles the day - to - day raising of the kids by doing chores like making meals , driving the kids to school appointments , and after school activities , taking care of Michelle as a baby , and helping the kids with their homework . Joey also buys D.J. her first car for her 16th birthday in the season six episode `` Grand Gift Auto , '' which ends up getting repossessed after the police discover that the car had been stolen ; Joey nearly moves out again after the family 's attempts to try illustrate that Joey is not capable of committing a crime make him believe that the rest of the family thinks of him as a big joke . It is in this episode that Joey reveals that he had wished to have siblings as he grew up as an only child ( even imaging that he was part of The Brady Bunch ) , and that being part of the Tanner family gave him the extended family he always wanted . In season four 's `` Viva Las Joey , '' Joey is reunited with his estranged father ( at the arrangement of Stephanie and D.J. ) , a former serviceman in the Armed Forces , with whom Joey did not get along with growing up due to his strict parenting style and his disapproval of Joey 's dream of being a comedian ; his father realizes that Joey made the right career decision when he sees his son 's routine when Joey is invited as an opening act for Wayne Newton in Las Vegas . </P> <P> Joey has held various jobs in addition to his work as a stand - up comic . For a while during seasons two and three , Joey and Jesse run an advertising business , J&J Creative Services , in which they partnered to compose jingles for television and radio commercials . In season four 's `` Joey Goes Hollywood , '' Joey wins a role he secretly auditions for in a sitcom co-starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello called Surf 's Up . Joey 's most successful job was portraying `` Ranger Joe , '' on an afternoon children 's variety television show . He was given the job to replace retiring original host `` Ranger Roy '' in season five 's `` The Legend of Ranger Joe , '' only to be fired after triggering Roy 's acute physical paranoia when hugging him as a thank you ; after Danny informs Joey of this while telling him of his firing , Joey ends up saving Roy from a `` hug - o - gram '' that he had sent to gratitude for the job ; he then gets rehired after Roy becomes impressed with Joey 's hosting skills when he takes over for Roy on his last show . Ranger Joe 's sidekick is his wise - cracking woodchuck marionette puppet `` Mr. Woodchuck '' ( first seen in `` The Legend of Ranger Joe '' and last seen in `` Michelle Rides Again '' ) . Joey quits his job in season six 's `` Radio Days , '' after he becomes disgruntled with his boss Mr. Strowbridge 's wife as his co-host . Jesse and Joey subsequently become co-hosts of a successful afternoon show on radio station KFLH called , Rush Hour Renegades . Besides his impressions , much of Joey 's humor comes from his depiction as a man child , particularly the fact that he still watches cartoons as an adult and has an extensive knowledge of animation . </P> <P> Joey has moved to Las Vegas in Fuller House , and is now married with four kids . His wife Ginger is a magician , and their kids , Phyllis , Lewis , Joan , and Jerry are very loud and obnoxious kids . Joey and his kids are moving back to San Francisco since his wife will be working as a magician on a cruise ship for six months . He also bought back the Smash Club with Jesse . </P> <H3> D.J.

Over the course of the show 's run , D.J. attends Frasier Street Elementary , Van Atta Junior High and Bayview High School . In the pilot episode `` Our Very First Show , '' she ends up having to share her bedroom with Stephanie in order to allow Jesse to move into Stephanie 's old bedroom ; due to problems with privacy regarding Stephanie , in the season five episode `` Take My Sister , Please , '' she sells Danny on an idea to switch rooms with Michelle , who in turn would move in with Stephanie ( only after convincing Michelle to move in with Stephanie , after she rejects the offer to move in with her older sister ) . </P> <P> D.J. is typically the daughter who acts the most practical , often giving advice to her younger sisters , Michelle and Stephanie . Although she sometimes bickers with them , she cares for them deeply . As D.J. entered into middle school , she started to deal with more serious issues like puberty and dating . She has her first serious relationship with Steve Hale ( who was first introduced in the season five episode `` Sisters in Crime '' ) , who later becomes a real fixture in her life ( and a regular character beginning in season six ) when their characters return from a summer abroad in Spain . Their relationship lasts until they break up in the season seven episode `` Love on the Rocks , '' when they realize that the passion in their relationship is gone , but they agree to remain friends . D.J. has on - and - off relationships ( during the show 's final season ) with guitarist Viper ( a member of Jesse 's new band Hot Daddy and the Monkey Puppets ) and rich kid Nelson , but both relationships do not last ( the two end up vying for D.J. 's affections in the season eight episode `` D.J. 's Choice , '' only for D.J. to reject them both after their fighting gets to be too much for her to bear ) . In the series finale `` Michelle Rides Again , '' Steve shows up at the Tanner house to take D.J. to her senior prom and they share a kiss . Her best friend throughout the show was next - door neighbor Kimmy Gibbler , who was the complete opposite of D.J. in every way .

On the way to Steve 's wedding in Japan , D.J. who 's preparing to fall asleep , and wearing a sleeping mask reveals to Kimmy that she was going to pick Steve not Matt , and feels like she 's losing her soulmate . Unbeknownst to her Steve was the one who heard her confession not Kimmy . Steve tells Kimmy what she said , and he was going to confront D.J. but he saw Matt proposing to her . The next day before the wedding starts Kimmy tells D.J. that Steve was the one who heard what she said on the plane . At the alter Steve calls off the wedding , and D.J. breaks off her engagement to Matt . Back home the two wait a month before they will start dating again .

He chooses to stay with her but D.J. called the team and said that he will take the job . </P> <H3> Stephanie Tanner </H3> <P> Stephanie Judith Tanner ( portrayed by Jodie Sweetin ) is the witty , sarcastic middle child of Danny and Pam , the younger sister of D.J. , and the older sister of Michelle . Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler . </P> <P> In Fuller House , Stephanie volunteers to give up her life in London to move back into her childhood home to help take care of her sister 's three kids .

Danny is more overprotective of Michelle than the other girls . Michelle was just a baby when Pam died , so she hardly remembers her mom .

Kimmy volunteers to be his and Stephanie 's surrogate . </P> <H2> Recurring characters </H2> <Ul> <Li> Vicky Larson ( played by Gail Edwards ) is Danny 's girlfriend during seasons five and six and was briefly his fiancée from the season six episode `` The House Meets the Mouse '' until halfway through season seven . Vicky is very focused on her career , which proves to be the undoing in her long - distance relationship with Danny . They meet in season five 's `` Nicky and / or Alexander , '' when Vicky fills in for Becky ( who is on maternity leave ) on Wake Up , San Francisco , and start dating two episodes later in `` Easy Rider '' . Later in season five 's `` Play It Again , Jesse , '' Danny insists that she take a news anchor job in Chicago that she was offered once Becky returns , and that starts a long - distance relationship ( that goes from early season six to mid-season seven ) . Danny eventually proposes to her when she comes along on the family 's vacation to Walt Disney World in `` The House Meets the Mouse '' . However , Vicky later gets her dream job -- anchoring the network news in New York City -- in the season seven episode `` The Perfect Couple '' ( the character 's final appearance ) ; as a result , she can not come to live with Danny and his family in San Francisco , nor is Danny able to uproot his family in California . Therefore , to the dismay of themselves and Danny 's family , they have a mutual breakup . Vicky often gives advice , such as helping D.J. with her relationship with Steve , and helping Danny to deal with it and serves as a motherly figure to D.J. , Stephanie , and Michelle .

Nick is the owner of an insect extermination business . He met his wife , Irene , the day that Elvis was drafted into the United States Army . Nick was a firm but caring parent . In the episode , `` D.J. 's Day Off '' it is mentioned that he would punish Jesse severely . This combination is also seen in the episode `` It Is Not My Job '' , when Jesse quits the extermination business Nick responds with : `` If you 're out of the business , you 're out of the family . '' Later on , he explains this by saying that he did not build up the business to sell it to a stranger . His love for his family is also shown by the fact that Irene bringing in Michelle curbed his anger . When Michelle was getting ready to do a television commercial for marshmallows in the season two episode `` El Problema Grande de D.J. '' , he remarked that Michelle looked like a little blonde version of the redhead he likes on Gilligan 's Island , which was revealed to be Tina Louise by Irene . In honor of inheriting Nick 's hair , Jesse names one of his twin sons after him . Nicky and Alex never interact with their grandparents on - screen like the girls have , as Nick and Irene are last seen in season four . Nick re-appears in season three of Fuller House when he comes to take care of Tommy while everyone else goes to Japan for Steve 's wedding . Nick mentions to Tommy about going out to find women , so it is assumed that him and Irene are no longer together or she is no longer living . </Li> <Li> Irene Katsopolis ( played by Yvonne Wilder , and by Rhoda Gemignani in `` The Return of Grandma '' ) is Jesse and Pam 's mother , the wife of Nick Katsopolis , and maternal grandmother to D.J. , Stephanie , and Michelle . She often talked about diapering Jesse 's `` tushy '' , and touched his and other people 's `` tushies , '' which made Jesse mad ; at other times , she would talk about when Jesse was a kid . She often mentioned how she is older than Nick , and her passion for younger men ( which makes Nick feel inferior at times ) . </Li> <Li> Claire Tanner ( portrayed by Alice Hirson , and Doris Roberts ) is Danny 's mother .

He accompanies her when she needs a `` date '' to sneak out and join Danny on a date with Vicky in the season five episode `` Bachelor of the Month '' . He is also the one whose house Michelle runs away to in `` The Devil Made Me Do It '' later that season ( Tahj Mowry 's real - life sisters Tia and Tamera Mowry appear in that episode in a dual role as Teddy 's older sister ) . He moves to Amarillo , Texas in the season six episode `` The Long Goodbye '' ; Teddy returns in the season seven episode `` Be Your Own Best Friend '' , when his father 's job moves him back to San Francisco . He and Michelle even consider trying to be boyfriend and girlfriend in third grade in the season eight episode `` Dateless in San Francisco '' , but find that it is no fun for children their age . </Li> <Li> Denise Frazer ( played by Jurnee Smollett ) is Michelle 's best female friend , introduced in the season six episode `` The Long Goodbye '' .

Danny makes her understand that it is possible to have more than one best friend . Michelle ultimately forms a trio of friends with Teddy and Denise at the end of that episode . In the season seven episode `` Too Little Richard Too Late , '' it is revealed that Denise 's uncle is Little Richard ( who guest starred in the episode ) . Denise does not appear after that episode , having been written out without explanation due to Smollett 's role in the short - lived ABC sitcom On Our Own ( which aired during the 1994 - 95 season , concurring with the run of Full House 's eighth and final season ) . </Li> <Li> Aaron Bailey ( played by Miko Hughes ) is Michelle 's recurring and longest running classmate . Introduced in the season three episode `` Bye , Bye Birdie '' , he is the typical class bully , who tends to be annoying and rude at times . He pinches Michelle in the season four episode `` A Pinch for a Pinch , '' which results in Jesse telling Michelle to fight back by pinching him in retaliation . When the teacher punishes them , Jesse takes Michelle home , pulling her out of preschool . While that behavior does not continue , his obnoxious ways continue throughout the series . In other episodes , he treats Jesse as either an equal or underlying rival . In addition , he also creates trouble for D.J. and Kimmy when they have boys over while Kimmy is babysitting in season four 's `` Girls Just Wanna Have Fun '' .

Stephanie gets involved in a few wild , irresponsible things because of Gia , such as going to a make - out party planned by her in the season eight episode `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' , and ( almost ) smoking in `` Fast Friends '' . Conversely , Stephanie was also a positive influence on Gia . During an unknown time when her parents had been through a divorce , Gia is shown as a cigarette - smoking , rebellious teen with horrible grades . She is two years older than Stephanie , as she was held back in school . Viewers learn ( as of `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) that because of Stephanie , Gia has stopped smoking , became more respectful , improved her grades , and lost her inclination to play pranks on other people . Gia becomes the target of put downs at the hands of Michelle in much the same way as Kimmy is targeted by Stephanie . Over time , Michelle becomes quite creative with her insults . Gia reappears in season 2 of Fuller House when Kimmy gets the idea of getting their band `` Girl Talk '' back together . Things do n't go well when Gia and D.J. have a hard time getting along . In season 3 , it was revealed that Gia has a daughter named Roxanne `` Rocki '' ( portrayed by Landry Bender ) who is in summer school with Jackson . </Li> <Li> Derek S.

Michelle first meets Derek in the episode `` The Play 's the Thing , '' when he lands the role of Yankee Doodle in their school play , America the Beautiful . Though Michelle is initially jealous of Derek for winning the part over her ( due in no small part to the fact that both of her sisters played Yankee Doodle in the same play ) , she helps him recover from a case of stage - fright , and they eventually become friends . Derek is very educated and well - spoken for a boy of his age , though also a bit on the wimpy side . He also shows signs of being a bit obsessive - compulsive .

Not much is revealed about Nelson 's background or family , aside from the fact that he is very rich , and often throws and attends big parties on yachts . Though in `` Taking the Plunge , '' he mentions that his cousin , Regina -- with whom he sets Joey up on a date -- is visiting the United States from England . Toward the latter stages of his `` relationship '' with D.J. , in `` D.J. 's Choice , '' he gets into a `` tug - of - war '' with Viper to be D.J. 's boyfriend , to which she declines both boys .

However , when she tells him the truth , Jesse tells Michelle that it is okay to cry in mourning of Papouli , as the two start sobbing and hugging each other .

The syndicated series features Mathis adjudicating small claims disputes . </P> <P> The series was originally produced by Black Pearl Entertainment . It 's now produced by Telepictures Productions and Syndicated Productions , while distributed by Warner Bros. Television . It is taped at the NBC Tower in Chicago , but includes cases and litigants from other U.S. jurisdictions . </P> <P> Greg Mathis 's `` inspirational and positive messages to young people '' won the court show a PRISM Commendation in May 2002 . The court show also won an NAACP Image Award in 2004 and a Daytime Emmy Award in 2018 . </P> <P> Each Judge Mathis episode runs for one hour and typically consists of 4 cases . The show is broadcast weekdays nationwide in the United States . It is also broadcast in Canada through Omni Television . The show has aired since 1999 and has aired over 2000 episodes . </P> <P> In the 2014 - 15 television season , Judge Mathis began its 16th season , making Mathis the longest serving African American court show arbitrator , after Judge Joe Brown whose program lasted 15 seasons . </P> <P> Judge Mathis is the fourth longest running courtroom series behind Divorce Court , The People 's Court , and Judge Judy . It began its 19th season on Monday , September 4 , 2017 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Show format </Li> <Li> 2 Incorporation of life story into court show </Li> <Li> 3 Judge Gregory Mathis 's adjudicating approach </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Show format ( edit ) </H2> <P> The cases on Judge Mathis are classified as tort law , civil disputes with a maximum $5,000 claim , a typical amount for small claims court . The producers of the show select the cases . To acquire cases , the show solicits real - life litigants with pending disputes or individuals with potential disputes . If litigants agree to be on the show , they are paid a talent fee ranging from $150 to $300 , and they receive travel accommodations . Mathis does have prior knowledge of the cases . In all cases , litigants give their prospective case managers all evidence in advance . Any real legal case pending must be dismissed by both parties . Typically , Mathis 's producers only seek cases that they deem `` juicy '' enough for TV . Occasionally , Mathis leaves the courtroom to deliberate and then returns with his verdict . Upon final judgment , he may briefly explain the legal principle guiding his verdict , especially if his ruling is based on a particular state 's law . Reportedly , Mathis ' rulings conform to the laws of the state where the case was originally filed . </P> <H2> Incorporation of life story into court show ( edit ) </H2> <P> As a child and a teenager , Mathis was frequently in legal trouble . He was a member of a street gang in Detroit , and he was arrested and sentenced to jail for illegally carrying a firearm when he was 17 years old . </P> <P> Mathis has frequently used his courtroom series to highlight his troubled - youth - turned - success - story as a way of motivating and inspiring his audience ( especially youth audience ) that there 's no adversity that they ca n't pick themselves up from . It is from his background where Mathis derives much of his courtroom formula . For example , his show 's opening theme was formerly a brief documentary of his powerful life story . As another example , he takes a liking to litigants who 've seen the error of their ways and have made efforts to improve and better their lives . </P> <H2> Judge gregory Mathis 's adjudicating approach ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Greg Mathis <P> Mathis typically begins proceedings by having litigants expound on their side of the dispute , so as to gain insight into the matter . Cases on Judge Mathis tend to go deeper and to more revealing places than those of most other court shows . He also calls attention to peculiarities or juicy details exposed throughout the course of the proceedings as a means of making the cases more interesting to viewers . Furthermore , Mathis does n't hesitate to tackle any social issues that emerge during the proceedings , tying his social justice perspectives to the cases . </P> <P> While hearing the testimonies , Mathis takes on a relaxed , attentive , understanding and open - minded nature . Rarely missing an opportunity to jest or poke fun , Mathis is given to fun , humor , good - natured ridicule and gibes , often rousing his audience to uproarious amusement . He sometimes cuts the tension -- even tension he himself has fostered -- with wisecracks or taunting remarks . Mathis has bantered directly at audience members on occasion , also resulting in audience amusement . He uses a rather high - pitched voice as part of stultifying litigants and suggesting that they 've not recognized the obvious . </P> <P> Combined with his teasing and comedic tendencies on the bench , Mathis is known for his street smart , urban expressions and stern side as well . In moments in which Mathis has found a litigant guilty of a particularly reprehensible act , he takes on a very resentful nature along with lecturing and shaming behaviors . Sometimes in these moments , Mathis makes a point of solemnizing his courtroom due to prior laughs and lightheartedness , letting litigants and everyone on hand know that things are no longer a laughing matter and that he 's to be taken seriously . </P> <P> The final portion of most of the cases generally see Mathis displaying a harshly corrective side , providing an explanation behind the direction of his verdict in the form of a sharp tirade , unbroken in delivery so as not to allow anyone a word in edgewise before his gavel pound and exit . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Judge Mathis Bio '' .

The book tells a Christmas - themed story , written in rhyme , that explains how Santa Claus knows who is naughty and who is nice . It describes elves visiting children between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve , after which they return to the North Pole until the next holiday season . The Elf on the Shelf comes in a keepsake box that features a hardbound picture book and a small soft toy in the form of a pixie scout elf . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Mensch on a Bench </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Criticism </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> This story describes how Santa 's `` scout elves '' hide in people 's homes to watch over events . Once everyone goes to bed , the scout elf flies back to the North Pole to report to Santa the activities , good and bad , that have taken place throughout the day . Before the family wakes up each morning , the scout elf flies back from the North Pole and hides . By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house , the scout elf plays an ongoing game of hide and seek with the family . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf explains that scout elves get their magic by being named and being loved by a child . In the back of each book , families have an opportunity to write their elf 's name and the date that they adopted it . Once the elf is named , the scout elf receives its special Christmas magic , which allows it to fly to and from the North Pole . </P> <P> The book tells how the magic might disappear if the scout elf is touched , so the rule for The Elf on the Shelf states , `` There 's only one rule that you have to follow , so I will come back and be here tomorrow : Please do not touch me . My magic might go , and Santa wo n't hear all I 've seen or I know . '' Although families are told not to touch their scout elf , they can speak to it and tell it all their Christmas wishes so that it can report back to Santa accurately . </P> <P> The story ends on Christmas Day with the elf leaving to stay with Santa for the rest of the year until the following Christmas season . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Elf on the Shelf was written in 2004 by Carol Aebersold and daughter Chanda Bell over a cup of tea . Bell suggested they write a book about an old tradition of an elf sent from Santa who came to watch over them at Christmas time . Aebersold 's other daughter , Christa Pitts , was recruited by the family to share her expertise in sales and marketing . Together , the trio devoted the next three years promoting their self - published book and attending book signings and trade shows . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf won the Best Toy Award by Learning Express , won Book of the Year Award from Creative Child Awards and National Best Books Award sponsored by USA Book News in 2008 . In 2012 , The Elf on the Shelf made its first appearance in the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade alongside fellow parade newcomers Hello Kitty and Papa Smurf . In 2013 , The Elf on the Shelf hit the # 1 spot on the USA Today Bestsellers List . </P> <P> On 26 November 2011 , the book aired on CBS as a 30 - minute animated TV show , An Elf 's Story : The Elf on the Shelf , directed by Chad Eikhoff . The Washington Post criticized the quality of the animation and dismissed it as `` just a half - hour advertisement for a book and a toy '' , which it felt would not join `` the canon of prime - time animated Christmas specials that actually move the spirit '' . Common Sense Media disagreed , calling the special `` a great addition to families ' holiday TV traditions '' ; however , they also warn parents about the consumer - driven nature of the story , and make note of its lack of educational value . </P> <P> In October 2013 , The Elf on the Shelf : A Birthday Tradition was released . Written and illustrated by the same team that created the first book , it offers instructions for inviting a scout elf to visit for a child 's birthday party and describes how the elf decorates a chair for the child . In April 2014 , two supplemental birthday products were released : The Elf on the Shelf Birthday Countdown Game and The Elf on the Shelf Birthday Chair Decoration Kit . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf was parodied as `` The Gnome in the Home '' in `` The Nightmare After Krustmas , '' a 2016 episode of The Simpsons . </P> <H3> Mensch on a Bench ( edit ) </H3> <P> A Jewish counterpart to Elf On The Shelf was created : `` Mensch on a Bench , '' a stuffed toy that looks a bit like a rabbi or a Hasidic Jew . Jewish father Neal Hoffman , a former Hasbro Toys toy marketing executive , raised more than $20,000 , using the crowdfunding website Kickstarter to fund creation of the toy in the Spring of 2011 . `` Mensch '' , in Yiddish , means a person of integrity or honor . </P> <P> Cody Decker , the starting left fielder for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic , brought the team 's mascot , a five - foot version of `` Mensch on a Bench , '' with him to Asia from the United States for the World Baseball Classic . Decker said he `` tried getting him a first - class ticket . But that did n't fly , so he was put in a duffel bag and checked . '' The mascot proved to be a big hit . He has his own locker , sits on Team Israel 's bench in the dugout during every game , and sat alongside Decker at a press conference in South Korea . Decker said : </P> <P> `` He 's a mascot , he 's a friend , he 's a teammate , he 's a borderline deity to our team ... He brings a lot to the table ... Every team needs their Jobu . He was ours . He had his own locker , and we even gave him offerings : Manischewitz , gelt , and gefilte fish ... He is everywhere and nowhere all at once . His actual location is irrelevant because he exists in higher metaphysical planes . But he 's always near . '' </P> <P> Team Israel Manager Jerry Weinstein said : `` He 's on the team . Everybody brings something to the team , and certainly The Mensch is a unifying factor for the ball club . '' Pitcher Gabe Cramer said : `` The Mensch on a Bench is ... a symbol we can rally around as a team . We are proud to be Jewish , but we know how to make and take a joke , something Jews have a long history of doing . The Mensch is a great way to have fun in the dugout while reminding us of why we 're here and who we 're representing . '' </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Elf has received some criticism from cultural reviewers . The Atlantic columnist Kate Tuttle calls it `` a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a tradition '' whose purpose is `` to spy on kids '' and that one should n't `` bully your child into thinking that good behavior equals gifts . '' Washington Post reviewer Hank Stuever characterized the concept as `` just another nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes '' . Writing for Psychology Today , Dr. David Kyle Johnston calls it a `` dangerous parental crutch '' , with much the same reasoning as what he terms the `` Santa lie '' . Professor Laura Pinto suggests that it conditions kids to accept the surveillance state and that it communicates to children that `` it 's okay for other people to spy on you , and you 're not entitled to privacy . '' She argues that `` if you grow up thinking it 's cool for the elves to watch me and report back to Santa , well , then it 's cool for the NSA to watch me and report back to the government ... The rule of play is that kids get to interact with a doll or video game or what have you , but not so with the Elf on the Shelf : The rule is that you do n't touch the elf . Think about the message that sends . '' </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ ( 1 ) Archived April 15 , 2014 , at the Wayback Machine . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` An Elf 's Story '' .

He is best remembered for his role in Paul Revere 's `` midnight ride '' to warn the townspeople of Concord of the impending British army move to capture guns and gunpowder kept there at the beginning of the American Revolution . He was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 The Ride </Li> <Li> 3 Prescott 's life following `` The Ride '' </Li> <Li> 4 Legacy </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 Sources </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early Life ( edit ) </H2> Samuel Prescott 's uncle Jonathan Prescott <P> Dr. Samuel Prescott was born August 19 , 1751 . He lived in colonial Concord , Massachusetts , among his large extended family . ( His uncle was Jonathan Prescott . ) Much of this history was probably passed on to the family by his grand uncle Samuel Prescott , who knew many of the early Prescotts , and was even old enough to remember the first ancestor of the Concord branch of the family , John Prescott , founder of Lancaster , Massachusetts . Indeed , the Prescotts and their extended family played an important and often heroic role in colonial history . These include settling Concord , fighting in colonial wars , and negotiating for the ransom of Mary Rowlandson . </P> <P> Prescott followed in the footsteps of his older brother Benjamin and apprenticed under his father , Abel Prescott , for about seven years . He appears to have kept an extremely low profile during pre-revolutionary times as well as afterward , as best can be attained . He did open a practice in Concord , just before or after which time he began to court Lydia Mulliken , daughter of a well - respected Lexington clockmaker who had died in 1767 . </P> <P> During the latter part of his apprenticeship or shortly after he began his medical practice , he became an active member in the patriot movement . There is strong circumstantial evidence that he was an express courier for the Sons of Liberty and the Committees of Correspondence , and that he was an important liaison between the Concord Defense Committee and John Hancock and other leaders of the patriots . </P> <H2> The ride ( edit ) </H2> <P> On the evening of April 18 , 1775 , Paul Revere and William Dawes were dispatched by Joseph Warren to warn the countryside that the British were coming . Prescott was in Lexington at the time to visit with his fiancée , Lydia Mulliken . He was also there to report on Concord 's readiness , its status in hiding supplies and munitions from the British , and its success in moving cannon to Groton lest it fall into British hands . The British wanted the military stores at Concord and had hoped to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock in the process . </P> <P> When Prescott left Lexington , it was about 1 a.m. the next morning , April 19 . On his way back to Concord he met Paul Revere and William Dawes , who had just left Lexington shortly before him and were also on their way to Concord -- to warn the town that the Redcoats were on the march . </P> <P> When the three continued on to Hartwell 's tavern in the lower bounds of Lincoln , they were cut off by four British horseman who were part of a larger scouting party sent out the preceding evening . Revere was captured but both Prescott and Dawes succeeded in making a run for it . Prescott did so with a show of artful horsemanship and knowledge of the forest . Finally losing his pursuers , he circled about and headed quickly to Concord , carrying Revere 's warning to his townsmen . </P> <P> Dawes also escaped from his pursuers , but it was after a close chase , a frantic ruse on his part , and a bit of luck . Once he was safe , he considered circling around the patrol and racing on to Concord much as Prescott had , but he heard the Concord town house bell and knew Prescott had made it there , and so he continued on his special mission , for he was only assigned to accompany Revere to Concord . Prescott , meanwhile , continued west to warn Acton , Massachusetts while his brother Abel Prescott , Jr. rode south to warn Sudbury and Framingham . By this time , countless riders were also dispatched from other towns to spread the warning -- while bells and cannon were rung or fired to punctuate the danger at hand . </P> <P> Because of the `` midnight '' rides of Revere , Dawes , Prescott , and many other expresses ( couriers ) , minutemen and militia everywhere were on the ready , many marching to Concord to effectively engage the British Army at the Battles of Lexington and Concord . Prescott was there to witness the Battle of Concord , then tried to beat the British back to Lexington to see Lydia Mulliken and her family and to help with the wounded . He remained at Lexington as a volunteer surgeon for about two weeks , then seems to have disappeared into the war . </P> A National Park Service map showing the route of the initial Patriot messengers including Prescott ( purple trail ) <H2> Prescott 's Life following `` the ride '' ( edit ) </H2> <P> There is evidence that Prescott went on to serve as a surgeon in the Continental Army , a tradition that he joined the crew of a New England privateer , and a report that he was in prison in Halifax , Nova Scotia , where he may have died between November 23 , 1776 and December 26 ( 1777 ? ) . There is also circumstantial evidence that he served in some medical support capacity out of Fort Ticonderoga during the invasion attempts against Canada and until about the time of Benedict Arnold 's failed attempts against Sir Guy Carleton on Lake Champlain . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> Prescott 's ride is re-enacted every Patriots ' Day eve ( observed ) in the Town of Acton . The re-enactment begins in East Acton , continues through Acton Center , and ends at Liberty Tree Farm , where once was the home of a minuteman named Simon Hunt . The distance is approximately five miles ( 8 km ) . </P> <P> There are also re-enactments on Patriots ' Day ( usually the third Monday of April ) of the rides of William Dawes and Paul Revere , to commemorate the famous `` midnight '' ride that began in the evening hours of April 18 and continued on April 19 . </P> <P> Prescott 's ride is re-enacted every year at midnight April 18 -- 19 at Concord 's First Parish Church . The re-enactment is preceded by a Patriots ' Ball . The Minute Men march with fife and drum leading the attendees from the armory to the church . The Captain of the Concord Minute Men reads a message handed him by `` Prescott '' on horseback . </P> <P> A memorial plaque to Prescott is at his former home in Concord , Massachusetts . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Liberty 's Kids </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Selesky , H.E. , & Boatner , M.M.

The first , second and fourth seasons were filmed on northern Vancouver Island , British Columbia , and the third near Nahuel Huapi National Park in Patagonia , Argentina . It follows the self - documented daily struggles of 10 individuals ( 7 paired teams in season 4 ) as they survive in the wilderness for as long as possible using a limited amount of survival equipment . With the exception of medical check - ins , the participants are isolated from each other and all other humans . They may `` tap out '' at any time , or be removed due to failing a medical check - in . The contestant ( or team in Season 4 ) who remains the longest wins a grand prize of $500,000 . </P> <P> The series premiered on June 18 , 2015 . On August 19 , before the finale of season 1 , it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season , which would begin production in the fall of 2015 on Vancouver Island , Canada . Season 2 premiered on April 21 , 2016 . Season 3 was filmed in the second quarter of 2016 in Patagonia , Argentina and premiered on December 8 . One day before the season 3 premiere , History announced that casting had begun for season 4 . </P> <P> In January 2017 , a Danish version of the series premiered with the name Alone in the Wilderness ( Danish : Alene i vildmarken ) on DR3 . It featured ten contestants and was filmed in northern Norway . Participants chose 12 items from a list of 18 . </P> <P> In the fall of 2017 , a Norwegian version aired with 10 contestants spread around a lake with fish . It was near the tree line , so the few , small , mostly birch trees left few land resources . The last contestant tapped out after a little more than a month . </P> <P> The fifth season premiered on June 7 , 2018 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Format and rules <Ul> <Li> 1.1 General rules - all seasons </Li> <Li> 1.2 Season 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Season 5 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Reception </Li> <Li> 3 Episodes </Li> <Li> 4 Series overview <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Season 1 <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.2 Season 2 <Ul> <Li> 4.2. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.2. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.3 Season 3 <Ul> <Li> 4.3. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.3. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.4 Season 4 <Ul> <Li> 4.4. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.4. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.5 Season 5 <Ul> <Li> 4.5. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.5. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Format and rules ( edit ) </H2> <H3> General rules - all seasons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Contestants are dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island ( seasons 1 - 2 , 4 ) , Patagonia ( season 3 ) and Northern Mongolia ( season 5 ) , far enough apart to ensure that they will not come in contact with one another . The process begins in mid to late autumn ; this adds time pressure to the survival experience as the approaching winter causes temperatures to drop and food to become scarce . Although terrains may differ in each contestant 's location , the drop - off zones are assessed in advance to ensure a similar distribution of local resources is available to each contestant . </P> <P> Contestants each select 10 items of survival gear from a pre-approved list of 40 , and are issued a kit of standard equipment , clothing and first aid / emergency supplies . They are also given a set of cameras to document their daily experiences and emotions . Attempting to live in the wild for as long as possible , the contestants must find food , build shelters , and endure extreme isolation and psychological distress . </P> <P> Contestants who wish to withdraw from the competition for any reason ( referred to as `` tapping out '' ) may signal a rescue crew using a provided satellite telephone . In addition , medical professionals conduct periodic health checks on the contestants and may , at their discretion , disqualify and evacuate anyone they feel is unable to continue participating safely . The last remaining contestant wins a $500,000 cash prize . Contestants are warned that the show might last for up to a year . </P> <H3> Season 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 4 was also filmed in Northern Vancouver Island but included a team dynamic . Fourteen contestants , consisting of seven family - member pairs , were individually dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island . The two members of each team chose 10 items of survival gear to be equally divided between them . The team chose one member to be taken to a campsite ; the other began approximately 10 mi ( 16.09 km ) away and was required to hike to the site , using only a compass and bearing to find the way . Either member may tap out at any time , but doing so removed both of them from the competition ; in addition , if either member of a team was medically evacuated , both were disqualified . The last remaining team won the $500,000 prize . </P> <H3> Season 5 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 5 contestants were selected from non-winning contestants from Seasons 1 through 4 . The rules were otherwise similar to Seasons 1 through 3 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series received positive reviews in its first season and outstanding reviews for its third season , and earned a respectable 2.5 million total viewers , placing it in the top three new nonfictional cable series of 2015 . </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of Alone episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""2""> Season </Th> <Th_colspan=""2""> Episodes </Th> <Th_colspan=""2""> Originally aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> First aired </Th> <Th> Last aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 11 </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> June 18 , 2015 ( 2015 - 06 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> August 27 , 2015 ( 2015 - 08 - 27 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 13 </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> April 21 , 2016 ( 2016 - 04 - 21 ) </Td> <Td> July 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 07 - 14 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> December 8 , 2016 ( 2016 - 12 - 08 ) </Td> <Td> February 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 02 - 09 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 11 </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> June 15 , 2017 ( 2017 - 06 - 15 ) </Td> <Td> August 17 , 2017 ( 2017 - 08 - 17 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> 5 </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> June 14 , 2018 ( 2018 - 06 - 14 ) </Td> <Td> August 16 , 2018 ( 2018 - 08 - 16 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Series overview ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first season premiered on June 18 , 2015 . It was won by Alan Kay , who lost over 60 pounds during the course of the season . His staple foods were limpets and seaweed . He also consumed mussels , crab , fish and slugs . Lucas Miller enjoyed his time on the show and was selected based on his work as a wilderness therapist . His most difficult experience with the show was making honest confessions to the camera . Sam Larson described his time on the show as `` playing in the woods '' . He set a goal for himself to last 50 days . After he reached his goal , a large storm hit the island , which Larson described as being larger than any he had seen and prompting his decision to leave the island . Larson said that the loneliness and solitude took the most time to adjust to , and that his preparation for the show mostly consisted of mental preparation . </P> Location ( edit ) Quatsino Location of Quatsino in British Columbia <P> The season was shot in Quatsino Territory , located near Port Hardy , British Columbia . </P> <P> Quatsino is a small hamlet of 91 people located on Quatsino Sound in Northern Vancouver Island , Canada , only accessible by boat or float plane .

The winner , Zachary Fowler , had lost 70 lbs ( a third of his starting body weight ) before the end of his stay . The person who stayed the second - longest , Carleigh Fairchild , was pulled out because , at 101 lbs , she had lost nearly 30 % of her starting body weight and had a BMI of 16.8 . Participants were automatically `` pulled '' at a BMI of 17 or less . The fourth longest stayer , Dave Nessia , was pulled out when , due to inadequate caloric intake , his systolic pressure barely exceeded his diastolic pressure ( 80 / 60 mmHg ) , putting him in danger of death due to inadequate perfusion of the internal organs . </P> Location ( edit ) Location of Lakes Soberania , Montes and Escondido in Patagonia , Argentina <P> The third season was set in Patagonia , Argentina , in South America . The contestants were spread across multiple lakes in the foothills of the Andes mountain range . Unlike in seasons 1 and 2 , which were located on the Pacific Ocean , season 3 's food resources were mostly limited to brook and rainbow trout , forage , small birds , and the possibility of wild boar . Contestants also were at a disadvantage because they had no access to the flotsam and jetsam that washes up on the Pacific Coast . They also had no salt source . </P> <P> The weather in Patagonia is comparable to that of Vancouver Island , with rainfall averaging 78 inches a year . However , unlike Vancouver Island , snowfall is extremely common in the winter . </P> <P> Predators in Patagonia include wild boar and puma . </P> Contestants ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Age </Th> <Th> Gender </Th> <Th> Hometown </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Status </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Zachary Fowler </Td> <Td> 36 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Appleton , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Winner - 87 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Carleigh Fairchild </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Edna Bay , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 86 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Megan Hanacek </Td> <Td> 41 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Port McNeill , British Columbia </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 78 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dave Nessia </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Salt Lake City , Utah </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 73 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Callie North </Td> <Td> 27 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Lopez Island , Washington </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 72 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Greg Ovens </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Canal Flats , British Columbia </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 51 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Wowak </Td> <Td> 34 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Mahanoy City , Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 51 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Britt Ahart </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Mantua , Ohio </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 35 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Zachary Gault </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Caledon , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 8 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jim Shields </Td> <Td> 37 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Langhorne , Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 3 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Officially titled `` Alone : Lost & Found '' , the fourth season premiered on June 8 , 2017 . </P> Location ( edit ) Quatsino Location of Quatsino in British Columbia <P> The fourth season was again set on Vancouver Island , in Quatsino Territory , located near Port Hardy , British Columbia . </P> Contestants ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Team </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Age </Th> <Th> Gender </Th> <Th> Hometown </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Status </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Baird ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Jim Baird * </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Toronto , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 10 Winners - 75 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ted Baird </Td> <Td> 32 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Toronto , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brockdorff ( father / son ) </Td> <Td> Pete Brockdorff † </Td> <Td> 61 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Poolesville , Maryland </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 9 Tap out - 74 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sam Brockdorff * </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Poolesville , Maryland </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Whipple ( husband / wife ) </Td> <Td> Brooke Whipple † </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Fox , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 9 Tap out - 49 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dave Whipple * </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wilkes ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Chris Wilkes † </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Hattiesburg , Mississippi </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 8 Tap out - 14 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brody Wilkes * </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Kentwood , Louisiana </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bosdell ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Shannon Bosdell † </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Wrangell , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 5 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jesse Bosdell * </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Skowhegan , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ribar ( father / son ) </Td> <Td> Alex Ribar * </Td> <Td> 48 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Montville , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 2 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Logan Ribar † </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Liberty , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Richardson ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Brad Richardson * </Td> <Td> 23 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox Lake , Illinois </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 1 day ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Josh Richardson † </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox Lake , Illinois </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> * hiking team member ( other team member sets up camp ) </P> <P> † team member who tapped out </P> <H3> Season 5 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Officially titled `` Alone : Redemption '' , Season 5 premiered on June 14 , 2018 .

The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy were decommissioned , and the U.S. Armed Forces took control of their military bases until the new government could be formed and positioned to reestablish authority . Allied forces planned to demilitarize Japan , and new government adopted the Constitution of Japan with a no - armed - force clause in 1947 . </P> <P> After the Korean War began in 1950 , Douglas MacArthur , the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan and the Japanese government established the paramilitary `` National Police Reserve '' , which was later developed into the Japan Ground Self - Defense Force ( JGSDF ) . </P> <P> In 1951 , the Treaty of San Francisco was signed by the allied countries and Japan , which restored its formal sovereignty . At the same time , the U.S. and Japan signed the Japan - America Security Alliance . By this treaty , USFJ is responsible for the defense of Japan . As part of this agreement , the Japanese government requested that the U.S. military bases remain in Japan , and agreed to provide funds and various interests specified in the Status of Forces Agreement . At the expiration of the treaty , the United States and Japan signed the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan . The status of the United States Forces Japan was defined in the U.S. -- Japan Status of Forces Agreement . This treaty is still in effect , and it forms the basis of Japan 's foreign policy . </P> <P> In the Vietnam War , the US military bases in Japan , especially those in Okinawa Prefecture , were used as important strategic and logistic bases . In 1970 , the Koza riot occurred against the US military presence in Okinawa . The USAF strategic bombers were deployed in the bases in Okinawa , which was still administered by the U.S. government . Before the 1972 reversion of the island to Japanese administration , it has been speculated but never confirmed that up to 1,200 nuclear weapons may have been stored at Kadena Air Base , Okinawa in the 1960s . </P> <P> As of 2013 , there are approximately 50,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan , along with approximately 40,000 dependents of military personnel and another 5,500 American civilians employed there by the United States Department of Defense . The United States Seventh Fleet is based in Yokosuka , Kanagawa Prefecture . The 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force ( III MEF ) is based in Okinawa. 130 USAF fighters are stationed in the Misawa Air Base and Kadena Air Base . </P> <P> The Japanese government paid ¥ 217 billion ( US $2.0 billion ) in 2007 as annual host - nation support called Omoiyari Yosan ( 思いやり 予算 , sympathy budget or compassion budget ) . As of the 2011 budget , such payment was no longer to be referred to as Omoiyari Yosan or sympathy budget . Japan compensates 75 percent of U.S. basing costs -- $4.4 billion . </P> <P> The U.S. government employs over 8,000 Master Labor Contract ( MLC ) / Indirect Hire Agreement ( IHA ) workers on Okinawa ( per the Labor Management Organization ) not including Okinawan contract workers . </P> <P> Immediately after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami , 9,720 dependents of United States military and government civilian employees in Japan evacuated the country , mainly to the United States . </P> <P> The relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Henoko had been resolved in December 2013 with the signing of the landfill agreement by the governor of Okinawa . Under the terms of the U.S. - Japan agreement 5,000 U.S. Marines should have been relocated to Guam and 4,000 U.S. Marines to other Pacific locations such as Hawaii or Australia , while some 10,000 Marines were to remain on Okinawa . No timetable for the Marines redeployment had been announced , but The Washington Post reported that U.S. Marines would leave Okinawa as soon as suitable facilities on Guam and elsewhere were ready . The relocation move was expected to cost 8.6 billion US Dollars and includes a $3.1 bn cash commitment from Japan for the move to Guam as well as for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands . Certain parcels of land on Okinawa which have been leased for use by the American military were supposed to be turned back to Japanese control via a long - term phased return process according to the agreement . These returns have been ongoing since 1972 . However , as of July 2016 , the situation has not been settled . </P> Further information : Relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma <P> In May 2014 , in a strategic shift by the United States to Asia and the Pacific , it was revealed the US was deploying two unarmed Global Hawk long - distance surveillance drones to Japan for surveillance missions over China and North Korea . </P> <H2> U.S. presence debate ( edit ) </H2> Do they need bases in Henoko or Futenma ? Are they unnecessary ? Even aside from this discussion , security is changing. -- Former Japan Minister of Defense Fumio Kyuma <H3> U.S. presence on Okinawa ( edit ) </H3> See also : Okinawa Prefecture § U.S. military controversy <P> Okinawa makes up only 0.6 percent of the nation 's land area ; yet , approximately 62 % of U.S. bases in Japan ( exclusive use only ) are in Okinawa . </P> <H3> Survey among Japanese and Okinawans ( edit ) </H3> <P> While , in 2002 , 73.4 % of Japanese citizens appreciate the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence of the USFJ , part of the population demands a reduction in the number of U.S. military bases in Okinawa . </P> <P> In May 2010 , a survey of the Okinawan people conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun and the Ryūkyū Shimpō , found that 71 % of Okinawans surveyed thought that the presence of Marines on Okinawa was not necessary ( 15 % said it was necessary . ) . Asked what they thought about 62 % of United States Forces Japan bases ( exclusive use ) being concentrated in Okinawa , 50 % said that the number should be reduced , 41 % said that the bases should be removed . Asked about the US - Japan security treaty , 55 % said it should be changed to a peace treaty , 14 % said it should be abolished and 7 % said it should be maintained . </P> <P> Many of the bases , such as Yokota Air Base , Naval Air Facility Atsugi and Kadena Air Base , are located in the vicinity of residential districts , and local citizens have complained about excessive aircraft noise . The 2014 poll by Ryūkyū Shimpō found that 80 % of surveyed Okinawans want the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma moved out of the prefecture . </P> <P> On 25 June 2018 residents of the island of Okinawa have rallied against the construction of a new airfield intended for the US military base in the United States . The activists , armed with placards and banners , went to sea on seventy boats and ships . The posters read : `` Do not build a base '' and `` Stop throwing gravel '' . Protesters urged the Japanese authorities to stop the expansion of the US military presence on the island . Some of the boats went to the guarded construction site , where they came across the Coast Guard patrol vessels . Some activists were arrested for invading a prohibited zone . </P> <H3> Status of Forces Agreement ( edit ) </H3> <P> There is also debate over the Status of Forces Agreement due to the fact that it covers a variety of administrative technicalities blending the systems which control how certain situations are handled between the U.S. 's and Japan 's legal framework . </P> <H3> U.S. Service member behavior ( edit ) </H3> <P> Between 1972 and 2009 , U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses , including 25 murders , 385 burglaries , 25 arsons , 127 rapes , 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts . Yet , per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data , U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans . According to the U.S. - Japan Status of Forces Agreement , when U.S. personnel crimes are committed both off - duty and off - base , they should always be prosecuted under the Japanese law . </P> <P> On 12 February 2008 , the National Police Agency ( of Japan ) or NPA , released its annual criminal statistics that included activity within the Okinawan prefecture . These findings held American troops were only convicted of 53 crimes per 10,000 U.S. male servicemen , while Okinawan males were convicted of 366 crimes per 10,000 . The crime rate found a U.S. serviceman in Okinawa to be 86 % less likely to convicted of a crime by the Japanese government than an Okinawan male . </P> <H3> Crime issues ( edit ) </H3> See also : Yumiko - chan incident , 1995 Okinawa rape incident , and Michael Brown Okinawa assault incident GIs in Special Comfort Facility Association during occupation of Japan . <P> At the beginning of the occupation of Japan , in 1945 , many U.S. soldiers participated in the Special Comfort Facility Association . The Japanese government recruited 55,000 women to work providing sexual services to US military personnel . The Association was closed by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers . </P> <P> In more recent history , `` crimes ranging from rape to assault and hit - and - run accidents by U.S. military personnel , dependents and civilians have long sparked protests in the prefecture , '' stated The Japan Times . `` A series of horrific crimes by present and former U.S. military personnel stationed on Okinawa has triggered dramatic moves to try to reduce the American presence on the island and in Japan as a whole , '' commented The Daily Beast in 2009 . </P> <P> In 1995 , the abduction and rape of a 12 - year - old Okinawan schoolgirl by two U.S. marines and one U.S. sailor led to demands for the removal of all U.S. military bases in Japan . Other controversial incidents include helicopter crashes , the Girard incident , the Michael Brown Okinawa assault incident , the death of Kinjo family and the death of Yuki Uema . In February 2008 , a 38 - year - old U.S. Marine based on Okinawa was arrested in connection with the reported rape of a 14 - year - old Okinawan girl . This triggered waves of protest against American military presence in Okinawa and led to tight restrictions on off - base activities . Although the accuser withdrew her charges the U.S. military court - martialed the suspect and sentenced him to 4 years in prison under the stricter rules of the military justice system . </P> <P> U.S. Forces Japan designated 22 February as a Day of Reflection for all U.S. military facilities in Japan , and established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Task Force in an effort to prevent similar incidents . In November 2009 , Staff Sgt . Clyde `` Drew '' Gunn , a U.S. Army soldier stationed at Torii Station was involved in a hit - and - run accident of a pedestrian in Yomitan Village on Okinawa . Later , in April 2010 , the soldier was charged with failing to render aid and vehicular manslaughter . Staff Sgt . Gunn , of Ocean Springs , Mississippi , was eventually sentenced to 2 years and 8 months in jail on 15 October 2010 . </P> <P> In 2013 , two U.S. military personnel , Seaman Christopher Browning , of Athens , Texas , and Petty Officer 3rd Class Skyler Dozierwalker , of Muskogee , Oklahoma , were found guilty by the Naha District Court of raping and robbing a woman in her 20s in a parking lot in October . Both admitted committing the crime . The case outraged many Okinawans , a number of whom have long complained of military - related crime on their island , which hosts thousands of U.S. troops . It also sparked tougher restrictions for all 50,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan , including a curfew and drinking restrictions . </P> <P> On 13 May 2013 , in a very controversial statement , Toru Hashimoto , co-leader of the Japan Restoration Association said to a senior American military official at the Marine Corps base in Okinawa `` We ca n't control the sexual energy of these brave marines . '' and told United States soldiers should make more use of the local adult entertainment industry to reduce sexual crimes against local women . Hashimoto also told the necessity of former Japanese Army comfort women and of prostitutes for the US military in other countries such as Korea . </P> <P> In June 2016 , after a civilian worker at the base was charged with murdering a Japanese woman , tens of thousands of people protested in Okinawa . Organizers estimated turnout at 65,000 people , which would be the largest anti-base protests in Okinawa since 1995 . </P> <P> In November 2017 , an intoxicated US service member was arrested following a vehicle crash on the Japanese island of Okinawa that killed the other driver . </P> <H3> Osprey deployment in Okinawa ( edit ) </H3> <P> In October 2012 , twelve MV - 22 Ospreys were transferred to the US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to replace aging Vietnam - era Boeing Vertol CH - 46 Sea Knight helicopters in Okinawa . In October 2013 , an additional 12 Ospreys arrived , again to replace CH - 46 Sea Knights , increasing the number of Ospreys to 24 . Japanese Defence Minister Satoshi Morimoto explained the Osprey aircraft is safe adding that two recent accidents were ' caused by human factors ' . Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda also stated that the Japanese government was convinced of the MV - 22 's safety . Various incidents involving V - 22 Ospreys have occurred in Okinawa . On 5 April , 2018 , it was announced that the US Air Force is to officially deploy CV - 22 Osprey aircraft at its Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo in a few months . The deployment would be the first of Ospreys in Japan other than in Okinawa , where the US Marines have already deployed their version of the aircraft , known as the MV - 22s . </P> <P> On 25 April , 2018 two US Air Force Osprey MV - 22 , deployed at US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on the Okinawa island , made an emergency landing at the Amami Airport on the nearby island in Kagoshima Prefecture . US Ospreys have experienced numerous mishaps in recent years , prompting Japanese officials to call for revision of certain provisions of the US - Japan Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) , which outlines the rights and privileges of foreign military personnel present in the country .

Established pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution in 1789 , it has ultimate ( and largely discretionary ) appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases involving issues of federal law plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases . In the legal system of the United States , the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the United States Constitution , but it may act only within the context of a case , in which it has jurisdiction . The Court may decide cases having political overtones but does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions , and its enforcement arm is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government . </P> <P> According to federal statute , the Court normally consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate . Once appointed , justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign , retire , or are removed after impeachment ( though no justice has ever been removed ) . In modern discourse , the justices are often categorized as having conservative , moderate , or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation . Each justice has one vote , and it is worth noting that while a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously , decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote , thereby exposing the justices ' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories . The Court meets in the Supreme Court Building in Washington , D.C. </P> <P> The Supreme Court is sometimes colloquially referred to as SCOTUS ( Supreme Court of the United States ) similar to and in line with other acronyms such as POTUS ( President of the United States ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Earliest beginnings to Marshall </Li> <Li> 1.2 From Taney to Taft </Li> <Li> 1.3 The New Deal era </Li> <Li> 1.4 Warren and Burger </Li> <Li> 1.5 Rehnquist and Roberts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Composition <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Size of the Court </Li> <Li> 2.2 Appointment and confirmation <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Recess appointments </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.3 Tenure </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Membership <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Current justices </Li> <Li> 3.2 Court demographics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Retired justices </Li> <Li> 3.4 Seniority and seating </Li> <Li> 3.5 Salary </Li> <Li> 3.6 Judicial leanings </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Facilities </Li> <Li> 5 Jurisdiction <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Justices as Circuit Justices </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Process <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Case selection </Li> <Li> 6.2 Oral argument </Li> <Li> 6.3 Supreme Court bar </Li> <Li> 6.4 Decision </Li> <Li> 6.5 Published opinions <Ul> <Li> 6.5. 1 Citations to published opinions </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Institutional powers and constraints </Li> <Li> 8 Law clerks <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Politicization of the Court </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Criticism <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Judicial activism </Li> <Li> 9.2 Failing to protect individual rights </Li> <Li> 9.3 Supreme Court has too much power </Li> <Li> 9.4 Courts are poor check on executive power </Li> <Li> 9.5 Federal versus state power </Li> <Li> 9.6 Secretive proceedings </Li> <Li> 9.7 Judicial interference in political disputes </Li> <Li> 9.8 Not choosing enough cases to review </Li> <Li> 9.9 Lifetime tenure </Li> <Li> 9.10 Accepting gifts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Court of the United States <P> The ratification of the United States Constitution established the Supreme Court in 1789 . Its powers are detailed in Article Three of the Constitution . The Supreme Court was the only court specifically established by the Constitution while all other federal courts were created by Congress . Congress is also responsible for conferring the title of `` justice '' to its members , who are known to scold lawyers for inaccurately referring to them as `` judge '' , even though it is the term used in the Constitution . </P> <P> The Court first convened on February 2 , 1790 with six judges where only five of its six initial positions were filled . According to historian Fergus Bordewich , in its first session : `` ( T ) he Supreme Court convened for the first time at the Royal Exchange Building on Broad Street , a few steps from Federal Hall . Symbolically , the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic , this birth of a new national institution whose future power , admittedly , still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans . Impressively bewigged and swathed in their robes of office , Chief Justice John Jay and three associate justices -- William Cushing of Massachusetts , James Wilson of Pennsylvania , and John Blair of Virginia -- sat augustly before a throng of spectators and waited for something to happen . Nothing did . They had no cases to consider . After a week of inactivity , they adjourned until September , and everyone went home . '' </P> <P> The sixth member , James Iredell , was not confirmed until May 12 , 1790 . Because the full Court had only six members , every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two - thirds ( voting four to two ) . However , Congress has always allowed less than the Court 's full membership to make decisions , starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789 . </P> <H3> Earliest beginnings to Marshall ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Jay Court , Rutledge Court , Ellsworth Court , and Marshall Court <P> Under Chief Justices Jay , Rutledge , and Ellsworth ( 1789 -- 1801 ) , the Court heard few cases ; its first decision was West v. Barnes ( 1791 ) , a case involving a procedural issue . The Court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige , a situation not helped by the highest - profile case of the era , Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) , which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment . </P> Chief Justice Marshall <P> The Court 's power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court ( 1801 -- 35 ) . Under Marshall , the Court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress , including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution ( Marbury v. Madison ) and made several important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and the states ( prominently , Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee , McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden ) . </P> <P> The Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim , a remnant of British tradition , and instead issuing a single majority opinion . Also during Marshall 's tenure , although beyond the Court 's control , the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 -- 05 helped cement the principle of judicial independence . </P> <H3> From Taney to Taft ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Taney Court , Chase Court , Waite Court , Fuller Court , White Court , and Taft Court <P> The Taney Court ( 1836 -- 64 ) made several important rulings , such as Sheldon v. Sill , which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear , it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects . Nevertheless , it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford , which helped precipitate the Civil War . In the Reconstruction era , the Chase , Waite , and Fuller Courts ( 1864 -- 1910 ) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution and developed the doctrine of substantive due process ( Lochner v. New York ; Adair v. United States ) . </P> <P> Under the White and Taft Courts ( 1910 -- 30 ) , the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states ( Gitlow v. New York ) , grappled with the new antitrust statutes ( Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States ) , upheld the constitutionality of military conscription ( Selective Draft Law Cases ) and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee ( Adkins v. Children 's Hospital ) . </P> <H3> The New Deal era ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Hughes Court , Stone Court , and Vinson Court <P> During the Hughes , Stone , and Vinson Courts ( 1930 -- 53 ) , the Court gained its own accommodation in 1935 and changed its interpretation of the Constitution , giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal ( most prominently West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , Wickard v. Filburn , United States v. Darby and United States v. Butler ) . During World War II , the Court continued to favor government power , upholding the internment of Japanese citizens ( Korematsu v. United States ) and the mandatory pledge of allegiance ( Minersville School District v. Gobitis ) . Nevertheless , Gobitis was soon repudiated ( West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette ) , and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro-government trend . </P> <H3> Warren and Burger ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Warren Court and Burger Court <P> The Warren Court ( 1953 -- 69 ) dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties . It held that segregation in public schools violates equal protection ( Brown v. Board of Education , Bolling v. Sharpe and Green v. County School Bd . ) and that traditional legislative district boundaries violated the right to vote ( Reynolds v. Sims ) . It created a general right to privacy ( Griswold v. Connecticut ) , limited the role of religion in public school ( most prominently Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. Schempp ) , incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the States -- prominently Mapp v. Ohio ( the exclusionary rule ) and Gideon v. Wainwright ( right to appointed counsel ) , -- and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police ( Miranda v. Arizona ) ; At the same time , however , the Court limited defamation suits by public figures ( New York Times v. Sullivan ) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories . </P> <P> The Burger Court ( 1969 -- 86 ) marked a conservative shift . It also expanded Griswold 's right to privacy to strike down abortion laws ( Roe v. Wade ) , but divided deeply on affirmative action ( Regents of the University of California v. Bakke ) and campaign finance regulation ( Buckley v. Valeo ) , and dithered on the death penalty , ruling first that most applications were defective ( Furman v. Georgia ) , then that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional ( Gregg v. Georgia ) . </P> <H3> Rehnquist and Roberts ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Rehnquist Court and Roberts Court <P> The Rehnquist Court ( 1986 -- 2005 ) was noted for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism , emphasizing the limits of the Constitution 's affirmative grants of power ( United States v. Lopez ) and the force of its restrictions on those powers ( Seminole Tribe v. Florida , City of Boerne v. Flores ) . It struck down single - sex state schools as a violation of equal protection ( United States v. Virginia ) , laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process ( Lawrence v. Texas ) , and the line item veto ( Clinton v. New York ) , but upheld school vouchers ( Zelman v. Simmons - Harris ) and reaffirmed Roe 's restrictions on abortion laws ( Planned Parenthood v. Casey ) . The Court 's decision in Bush v. Gore , which ended the electoral recount during the presidential election of 2000 , was especially controversial . </P> <P> The Roberts Court ( 2005 -- present ) is regarded by some as more conservative than the Rehnquist Court . Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption ( Wyeth v. Levine ) , civil procedure ( Twombly - Iqbal ) , abortion ( Gonzales v. Carhart ) , climate change ( Massachusetts v. EPA ) , same - sex marriage ( United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges ) and the Bill of Rights , notably in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ( First Amendment ) , Heller - McDonald ( Second Amendment ) and Baze v. Rees ( Eighth Amendment ) . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Size of the Court ( edit ) </H3> <P> Article III of the United States Constitution does not specify the number of justices . The Judiciary Act of 1789 called for the appointment of six `` judges '' . Although an 1801 act would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy , an 1802 act promptly negated the 1801 act , legally restoring the court 's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred . As the nation 's boundaries grew , Congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits : seven in 1807 , nine in 1837 , and ten in 1863 . </P> <P> In 1866 , at the behest of Chief Justice Chase , Congress passed an act providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced , which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition . Consequently , one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 . In 1869 , however , the Circuit Judges Act returned the number of justices to nine , where it has since remained . </P> <P> President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937 . His proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement , up to a maximum bench of 15 justices . The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges , but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to `` pack '' the Court with justices who would support Roosevelt 's New Deal . The plan , usually called the `` court - packing plan '' , failed in Congress . Nevertheless , the Court 's balance began to shift within months when Justice van Devanter retired and was replaced by Senator Hugo Black . By the end of 1941 , Roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice . </P> <H3> Appointment and confirmation ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States The Roberts Court ( April 2017 -- present ) . Front row ( left to right ) : Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Anthony Kennedy , John Roberts ( Chief Justice ) , Clarence Thomas , and Stephen Breyer . Back row ( left to right ) : Elena Kagan , Samuel A. Alito , Sonia Sotomayor , and Neil Gorsuch . <P> The U.S. Constitution states that the President `` shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court . '' Most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views , although a justice 's decisions may end up being contrary to a president 's expectations . Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice , a president may nominate anyone to serve , subject to Senate confirmation . </P> <P> In modern times , the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups , which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group 's views . The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive , negative or neutral report . The committee 's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent . The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925 , who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street , and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955 . Once the committee reports out the nomination , the full Senate considers it . Rejections are relatively uncommon ; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees , most recently Robert Bork , nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 . </P> <P> Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination , prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate . President Lyndon Johnson 's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee . It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas 's ethics . President Donald Trump 's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia was the second . Unlike the Fortas filibuster , however , only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination , citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy , and the Republican majority 's prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama 's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy . This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations . </P> <P> Not every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate . A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs , typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee ; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006 . The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination , which expires at the end of the session . For example , President Dwight Eisenhower 's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November , 1954 was not acted on by the Senate ; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955 , and Harlan was confirmed two months later . Most recently , as previously noted , the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland ; the nomination expired in January 2017 , and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump 's appointment of Neil Gorsuch . </P> <P> Once the Senate confirms a nomination , the president must prepare and sign a commission , to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed , before the new justice can take office . The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date , not the confirmation or swearing - in date . </P> <P> Before 1981 , the approval process of justices was usually rapid . From the Truman through Nixon administrations , justices were typically approved within one month . From the Reagan administration to the present , however , the process has taken much longer . Some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past . According to the Congressional Research Service , the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days ( 2.2 months ) , while the median is 71 days ( or 2.3 months ) . </P> Recess appointments ( edit ) <P> When the Senate is in recess , a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies . Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session ( less than two years ) . The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving ; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments , only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed . </P> <P> No president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the Court , and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts . In 1960 , after Eisenhower had made three such appointments , the Senate passed a `` sense of the Senate '' resolution that recess appointments to the Court should only be made in `` unusual circumstances . '' Such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress 's views in the hope of guiding executive action . </P> <P> The 2014 Supreme Court ruling in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning limited the ability of the President to make recess appointments ( including appointments to the Supreme Court ) , ruling that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session ( or in recess ) . Justice Breyer writing for the Court , stated , `` We hold that , for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause , the Senate is in session when it says it is , provided that , under its own rules , it retains the capacity to transact Senate business . '' This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of pro-forma sessions . </P> <H3> Tenure ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Constitution provides that justices `` shall hold their offices during good behavior '' ( unless appointed during a Senate recess ) . The term `` good behavior '' is understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives , unless they are impeached and convicted by Congress , resign , or retire . Only one justice has been impeached by the House of Representatives ( Samuel Chase , March 1804 ) , but he was acquitted in the Senate ( March 1805 ) . Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently ( for example , William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice , in 1953 and again in 1970 ; and Abe Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969 ) , but they did not reach a vote in the House . No mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury , but unable ( or unwilling ) to resign . </P> <P> Because justices have indefinite tenure , timing of vacancies can be unpredictable . Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession , as in the early 1970s when Lewis Franklin Powell , Jr. and William Rehnquist were nominated to replace Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II , who retired within a week of each other . Sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations , such as the eleven years between Stephen Breyer 's nomination in 1994 to succeed Harry Blackmun and the nomination of John Roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of Sandra Day O'Connor ( though Roberts ' nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of Chief Justice after Rehnquist died ) . </P> <P> Despite the variability , all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice . William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office , though his successor ( John Tyler ) made an appointment during that presidential term . Likewise , Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office , but his successor ( Millard Fillmore ) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term . Andrew Johnson , who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln , was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the Court . Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice . Somewhat similarly , presidents James Monroe , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice , but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office . No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment . </P> <P> Three presidents have appointed justices who together served more than a century . Andrew Jackson , Abraham Lincoln , and Franklin D. Roosevelt . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States <H3> Current justices ( edit ) </H3> <P> The court is currently filled with nine justices . The most recent justice to join to the court was Neil Gorsuch , who was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31 , 2017 , and confirmed on April 7 , 2017 , by the Senate . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Date of birth </Th> <Th> Appointed by </Th> <Th> Senate confirmation vote </Th> <Th> Age at appointment </Th> <Th> Current age </Th> <Th> First day / Length of service </Th> <Th> Previous positions </Th> <Th> Succeeded </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <P> Roberts , John John Roberts ( Chief Justice ) </P> </Td> <Td> 000000001955 - 01 - 27 - 0000 January 27 , 1955 Buffalo , New York </Td> <Td> Bush , George W.

Among the nine justices , there is one African - American ( Justice Thomas ) and one Hispanic ( Justice Sotomayor ) . Two of the justices were born to at least one immigrant parent : Justice Alito 's parents were born in Italy , and Justice Ginsburg 's father was born in Russia . At least five justices are Roman Catholics and three are Jewish ; it is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian . The average age is 67 years and 4 months . Every current justice has an Ivy League background . Four justices are from the state of New York , two from California , one from New Jersey , one from Georgia , and one from Colorado . In the 19th century , every justice was a man of European descent ( usually Northern European ) , and almost always Protestant . Concerns about diversity focused on geography , to represent all regions of the country , rather than religious , ethnic , or gender diversity . </P> <P> Most justices have been Protestants , including 36 Episcopalians , 19 Presbyterians , 10 Unitarians , 5 Methodists , and 3 Baptists . The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836 , and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice , Louis Brandeis . Several Catholic and Jewish justices have since been appointed , and in recent years the situation has reversed . The Court currently has at least five Catholic justices . </P> <P> Racial , ethnic , and gender diversity began to increase in the late 20th century . Thurgood Marshall became the first African American justice in 1967 . Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice in 1981 . Marshall was succeeded by African - American Clarence Thomas in 1991 . O'Connor was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 . After O'Connor's retirement Ginsburg was joined in 2009 by Sonia Sotomayor , the first Hispanic and Latina justice ; and in 2010 by Elena Kagan , for a total of four female justices in the Court 's history . </P> <P> There have been six foreign - born justices in the Court 's history : James Wilson ( 1789 -- 1798 ) , born in Caskardy , Scotland ; James Iredell ( 1790 -- 1799 ) , born in Lewes , England ; William Paterson ( 1793 -- 1806 ) , born in County Antrim , Ireland ; David Brewer ( 1889 -- 1910 ) , born in Smyrna , Turkey ; George Sutherland ( 1922 -- 1939 ) , born in Buckinghamshire , England ; and Felix Frankfurter ( 1939 -- 1962 ) , born in Vienna , Austria . </P> <H3> Retired justices ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States : John Paul Stevens , Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter . As retired justices , they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court , but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts , usually the United States Courts of Appeals . Such assignments are formally made by the Chief Justice , on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice . In recent years , Justice O'Connor has sat with several Courts of Appeals around the country , and Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit , the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court . </P> <P> The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status , and eligibility of a supreme court justice to assume retired status ( rather than simply resign from the bench ) is governed by the same age and service criteria . </P> <P> In recent times , justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal , institutional , ideological , partisan and sometimes even political factors playing a role . The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down . The desire to maximize the Court 's strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time , when the Court is in recess , and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health . Finally , especially in recent decades , many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office , to ensure that a like - minded successor would be appointed . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Date of birth </Th> <Th> Appointed by </Th> <Th> Retired under </Th> <Th> Confirmation vote </Th> <Th> Age at appointment </Th> <Th> Current age </Th> <Th> First day </Th> <Th> Date of retirement </Th> <Th> Length of service </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <P> John Paul Stevens </P> </Td> <Td> 000000001920 - 04 - 20 - 0000 April 20 , 1920 Chicago , Illinois </Td> <Td> Gerald Ford </Td> <Td> Barack Obama </Td> <Td> 98 -- 0 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> <Td> 7001970000000000000 ♠ 97 </Td> <Td> December 19 , 1975 </Td> <Td> June 29 , 2010 </Td> <Td> 34 years , 6 months and 10 days </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <P> Sandra Day O'Connor </P> </Td> <Td> 000000001930 - 03 - 26 - 0000 March 26 , 1930 El Paso , Texas </Td> <Td> Ronald Reagan </Td> <Td> George W.

The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service . </P> The interior of the United States Supreme Court <P> During Court sessions , the justices sit according to seniority , with the Chief Justice in the center , and the Associate Justices on alternating sides , with the most senior Associate Justice on the Chief Justice 's immediate right , and the most junior Associate Justice seated on the left farthest away from the Chief Justice . Therefore , the current court sits as follows from left to right , from the perspective of those facing the Court : Kagan , Alito , Ginsburg , Kennedy ( most senior Associate Justice ) , Roberts ( Chief Justice ) , Thomas , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Gorsuch . In the official yearly Court photograph , justices are arranged similarly , with the five most senior members sitting in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions ( The most recent photograph includes Ginsburg , Kennedy , Roberts , Thomas , Breyer ) , and the four most junior justices standing behind them , again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions ( Kagan , Alito , Sotomayor , Gorsuch ) . </P> <P> In the justices ' private conferences , current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority to begin with the chief justice first and end with the most junior associate justice . The most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone , such as answering the door of their conference room , serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk . Justice Joseph Story served the longest as junior justice , from February 3 , 1812 , to September 1 , 1823 , for a total of 4,228 days . Justice Stephen Breyer follows very closely behind serving from August 3 , 1994 , to January 31 , 2006 , for a total of 4,199 days . Justice Elena Kagan comes in at a distant third serving from August 6 , 2010 , to April 10 , 2017 , for a total of 2439 days . </P> <H3> Salary ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Federal judge salaries in the United States <P> As of 2017 , associate justices are paid $251,800 and the chief justice $263,300 . Article III , Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices . Once a justice meets age and service requirements , the justice may retire . Judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees , but a justice 's pension , as with other federal courts judges , can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement . </P> <H3> Judicial leanings ( edit ) </H3> See also : Ideological leanings of U.S. Supreme Court justices <P> Although justices are nominated by the president in power , justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties , as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches . Jurists are , however , informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives , moderates , or liberals . Such leanings , however , generally refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one . The nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval or disapproval of the nominated justice . </P> <P> Following the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch in 2017 , the Court consists of five justices appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic presidents . It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas and Alito ( appointed by Republican presidents ) comprise the Court 's conservative wing . Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor and Kagan ( appointed by Democratic presidents ) comprise the Court 's liberal wing . Justice Kennedy ( appointed by President Reagan ) is generally considered `` a conservative who has occasionally voted with liberals '' , and up until Justice Scalia 's death , he was often the swing vote that determined the outcome of cases divided between the conservative and liberal wings . Gorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th circuit . </P> <P> Tom Goldstein argued in an article in SCOTUSblog in 2010 , that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is `` in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions . '' He pointed out that in the 2009 term , almost half the cases were decided unanimously , and only about 20 % were decided by a 5 - to - 4 vote . Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal / conservative divide ( fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included ) . He also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the Court . Goldstein further argued that the large number of pro-criminal - defendant summary dismissals ( usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument ) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological . Likewise , Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress , show inadequate deference to the political process , and be disrespectful of precedent , also lacked merit : Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent ( even if long standing ) that he views as having been wrongly decided , and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation . </P> <P> According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog , in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011 , an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues ( 22 % ) were decided by a 5 -- 4 vote , with an average of 70 % of those split opinions decided by a Court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines ( about 15 % of all opinions issued ) . Over that period , the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62 % of the time that the Court has divided along ideological lines , which represents about 44 % of all the 5 -- 4 decisions . </P> <P> In the October 2010 term , the Court decided 86 cases , including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals ( where the Court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case ) . Four were decided with unsigned opinions , two cases affirmed by an equally divided Court , and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted . Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General . Of the 80 cases , 38 ( about 48 % , the highest percentage since the October 2005 term ) were decided unanimously ( 9 -- 0 or 8 -- 0 ) , and 16 decisions were made by a 5 -- 4 vote ( about 20 % , compared to 18 % in the October 2009 term , and 29 % in the October 2008 term ) . However , in fourteen of the sixteen 5 -- 4 decisions , the Court divided along the traditional ideological lines ( with Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan on the liberal side , and Roberts , Scalia , Thomas , and Alito on the conservative , and Kennedy providing the `` swing vote '' ) . This represents 87 % of those 16 cases , the highest rate in the past 10 years . The conservative bloc , joined by Kennedy , formed the majority in 63 % of the 5 -- 4 decisions , the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts court . </P> <P> In the October 2011 term , the Court decided 75 cases . Of these , 33 ( 44 % ) were decided unanimously , and 15 ( 20 % , the same percentage as in the previous term ) were decided by a vote of 5 -- 4 . Of the latter 15 , the Court divided along the perceived ideological lines 10 times with Justice Kennedy joining the conservative justices ( Roberts , Scalia , Thomas and Alito ) five times and with the liberal justices ( Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor and Kagan ) five times . </P> <P> In the October 2012 term , the Court decided 78 cases . Five of them were decided in unsigned opinions . 38 out of the 78 decisions ( representing 49 % of the decisions ) were unanimous in judgement , with 24 decisions being completely unanimous ( a single opinion with every justice that participated joining it ) . This was the largest percentage of unanimous decisions that the Court had in ten years , since the October 2002 term ( when 51 % of the decisions handed down were unanimous ) . The Court split 5 -- 4 in 23 cases ( 29 % of the total ) ; of these , 16 broke down along the traditionally perceived ideological lines , with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia , Thomas , and Alito on one side , Justices Ginsburg , Breyer , Sotomayor and Kagan on the other , and Justice Kennedy holding the balance . Of these 16 cases , Justice Kennedy sided with the conservatives on 10 cases , and with the liberals on 6 . Three cases were decided by an interesting alignment of justices , with Chief Justice Roberts joined by Justices Kennedy , Thomas , Breyer and Alito in the majority , with Justices Scalia , Ginsburg , Sotomayor , and Kagan in the minority . The greatest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Kagan , who agreed on 72 of the 75 ( 96 % ) cases , in which both voted ; the lowest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Alito , who agreed only on 45 out of 77 ( 54 % ) cases , in which they both participated . Justice Kennedy was in the majority of 5 -- 4 decisions on 20 out of 24 ( 83 % ) cases , and in 71 of 78 ( 91 % ) cases during the term , in line with his position as the `` swing vote '' of the Court . </P> <H2> Facilities ( edit ) </H2> The present U.S. Supreme Court building as viewed from the front From the 1860s until the 1930s , the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol . Main article : United States Supreme Court Building <P> The Supreme Court first met on February 1 , 1790 , at the Merchants ' Exchange Building in New York City . When Philadelphia became the capital , the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800 . After the government moved to Washington , D.C. , the Court occupied various spaces in the United States Capitol building until 1935 , when it moved into its own purpose - built home . The four - story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress , and is clad in marble . The building includes the courtroom , justices ' chambers , an extensive law library , various meeting spaces , and auxiliary services including a gymnasium . The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol , but maintains its own police force separate from the Capitol Police . </P> <P> Located across First Street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue , the building is open to the public from 9 am to 4 : 30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays . Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied . There is a cafeteria , a gift shop , exhibits , and a half - hour informational film . When the Court is not in session , lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9 : 30 am to 3 : 30 pm and reservations are not necessary . When the Court is in session the public may attend oral arguments , which are held twice each morning ( and sometimes afternoons ) on Mondays , Tuesdays , and Wednesdays in two - week intervals from October through late April , with breaks during December and February . Visitors are seated on a first - come first - served basis . One estimate is there are about 250 seats available . The number of open seats varies from case to case ; for important cases , some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night . From mid-May until the end of June , the court releases orders and opinions beginning at 10 am , and these 15 to 30 - minute sessions are open to the public on a similar basis . Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions . </P> <H2> Jurisdiction ( edit ) </H2> Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from Marbury v. Madison , in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review Main article : Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States <P> Congress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court 's appellate jurisdiction . The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states , but may decline to hear such cases . It also possesses original , but not exclusive , jurisdiction to hear `` all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors , other public ministers , consuls , or vice consuls of foreign states are parties ; all controversies between the United States and a State ; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens . '' </P> <P> In 1906 , the Court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in United States v. Shipp . The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the Court 's history . The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga , Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal . Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob -- aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded -- and hung from a bridge , after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson 's body reading : `` To Justice Harlan . Come get your nigger now . '' The local sheriff , John Shipp , cited the Supreme Court 's intervention as the rationale for the lynching . The Court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices , who found nine individuals guilty of contempt , sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail . </P> <P> In all other cases , however , the Court has only appellate jurisdiction , including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts . It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely ; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal . In practice , the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states . </P> <P> The Court 's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal ( through certiorari , certiorari before judgment , and certified questions ) , the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ( through certiorari ) , the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ( through certiorari ) , the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands ( through certiorari ) , the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ( through certiorari ) , and `` final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had '' ( through certiorari ) . In the last case , an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state 's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal . For example , a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if ( a ) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant certiorari , e.g. Florida Star v. B.J.F. , or ( b ) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court 's decision without discussing the merits of the case , since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions . The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts , rather than just federal courts , was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the Court 's history , by its rulings in Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee ( 1816 ) and Cohens v. Virginia ( 1821 ) . The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions , although there are several devices that permit so - called `` collateral review '' of state cases . It has to be noted that this `` collateral review '' often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system . </P> <P> Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain `` cases '' or `` controversies '' , the Supreme Court can not decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions , as the supreme courts of some states may do . For example , in DeFunis v. Odegaard , 416 U.S. 312 ( 1974 ) , the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit , and a decision from the Court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered . However , the Court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot . If an issue is `` capable of repetition yet evading review '' , the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result . In Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) , and other abortion cases , the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court . Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct , in which the Court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff 's need for relief . </P> <H3> Justices as circuit justices ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals , each of which is assigned a `` circuit justice '' from the Supreme Court . Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic , its meaning has changed through time . </P> <P> Under the Judiciary Act of 1789 , each justice was required to `` ride circuit '' , or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges . This practice encountered opposition from many justices , who cited the difficulty of travel . Moreover , there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the Court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit . Circuit riding was abolished in 1891 . </P> <P> Today , the circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that , under the Court 's rules , may be addressed by a single justice . These include applications for emergency stays ( including stays of execution in death - penalty cases ) and injunctions pursuant to the All Writs Act arising from cases within that circuit , as well as routine requests such as requests for extensions of time . In the past , circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases , writs of habeas corpus , and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal . Ordinarily , a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it `` granted '' or `` denied '' or entering a standard form of order . However , the justice may elect to write an opinion -- referred to as an in - chambers opinion -- in such matters if he or she wishes . </P> <P> A circuit justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that circuit , but over the past hundred years , this has rarely occurred . A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit . </P> <P> The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit , the Fourth Circuit ( which includes Maryland and Virginia , the states surrounding the District of Columbia ) , and since it was established , the Federal Circuit . Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits . </P> <P> As of June 27 , 2017 , the allotment of the justices among the circuits is : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Circuit </Th> <Th> Justice </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> District of Columbia Circuit </Td> <Td> Chief Justice Roberts </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> First Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Breyer </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Second Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Ginsburg </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Third Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Alito </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fourth Circuit </Td> <Td> Chief Justice Roberts </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fifth Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Alito </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sixth Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Kagan </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Seventh Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Kagan </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eighth Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Gorsuch </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ninth Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Kennedy </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Tenth Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Sotomayor </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eleventh Circuit </Td> <Td> Justice Thomas </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Federal Circuit </Td> <Td> Chief Justice Roberts </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Four of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges : Chief Justice Roberts ( D.C. Circuit ) , Justice Breyer ( First Circuit ) , Justice Alito ( Third Circuit ) , and Justice Kennedy ( Ninth Circuit ) . </P> <H2> Process ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States <P> A term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October , and continues until June or early July of the following year . Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as `` sittings '' and `` recesses . '' Justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings ; they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses . </P> <H3> Case selection ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari , commonly referred to as `` cert '' . The Court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals `` by writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case . '' Court may only review `` final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had '' if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law . The party that appealed to the Court is the petitioner and the non-mover is the respondent . All case names before the Court are styled petitioner v. respondent , regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court . For example , criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual , as in State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda . If the defendant is convicted , and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court , when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes Miranda v. Arizona . </P> <P> There are situations where the Court has original jurisdiction , such as when two states have a dispute against each other , or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state . In such instances , a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly . Examples of such cases include United States v. Texas , a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas , and Virginia v. Tennessee , a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court , and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval . Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v. Brailsford , parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact . Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v. Delaware , and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in Kansas v. Colorado . </P> <P> A cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a conference . A conference is a private meeting of the nine Justices by themselves ; the public and the Justices ' clerks are excluded . The rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of certiorari . If it is granted , the case proceeds to the briefing stage ; otherwise , the case ends . Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the respondent , the respondent may , but is not required to , file a response to the cert petition . </P> <P> The court grants a petition for cert only for `` compelling reasons '' , spelled out in the court 's Rule 10 . Such reasons include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution </Li> <Li> Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings </Li> <Li> Resolving an important question of federal law , or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the Court . </Li> </Ul> <P> When a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals , lawyers call this situation a `` circuit split . '' If the court votes to deny a cert petition , as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it , it does so typically without comment . A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case , and the decision of the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case . </P> <P> To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the Court each year ( of the more than 7,000 petitions the Court receives each year , it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer ) , the Court employs an internal case management tool known as the `` cert pool . '' Currently , all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool . </P> <H3> Oral argument ( edit ) </H3> <P> When the Court grants a cert petition , the case is set for oral argument . Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case , as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition . With the consent of the parties or approval of the Court , amici curiae , or `` friends of the court '' , may also file briefs . The Court holds two - week oral argument sessions each month from October through April . Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument ( the Court may choose to give more time , though this is rare ) , and during that time , the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions . The petitioner gives the first presentation , and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent 's arguments after the respondent has concluded . Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees . The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case . </P> <H3> Supreme Court Bar ( edit ) </H3> <P> In order to plead before the court , an attorney must first be admitted to the court 's bar . Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year . The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members . In reality , pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys . The rest join for a one - time fee of $200 , earning the court about $750,000 annually . Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups . The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court , wherein the Chief Justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys . Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume . They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument . Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library . </P> <H3> Decision ( edit ) </H3> <P> At the conclusion of oral argument , the case is submitted for decision . Cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices . It is the Court 's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular Term by the end of that Term . Within that Term , however , the Court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument . At the conclusion of oral argument , the Justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied , and the most senior Justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the Court 's opinion to a Justice on his or her side . Drafts of the Court 's opinion , as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions , circulate among the Justices until the Court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case . Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the United States Supreme Court Building , the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the Running of the Interns . </P> <P> It is possible that , through recusals or vacancies , the Court divides evenly on a case . If that occurs , then the decision of the court below is affirmed , but does not establish binding precedent . In effect , it results in a return to the status quo ante . For a case to be heard , there must be a quorum of at least six justices . If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case can not be heard and determined in the next term , then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly divided . For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court , the Chief Justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there . This has only occurred once in U.S. history , in the case of United States v. Alcoa ( 1945 ) . </P> <H3> Published opinions ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Court 's opinions are published in three stages . First , a slip opinion is made available on the Court 's web site and through other outlets . Next , several opinions and lists of the court 's orders are bound together in paperback form , called a preliminary print of United States Reports , the official series of books in which the final version of the Court 's opinions appears . About a year after the preliminary prints are issued , a final bound volume of U.S. Reports is issued . The individual volumes of U.S. Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports -- or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations -- to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily . </P> <P> As of the beginning of October Term 2016 , there are : </P> <Ul> <Li> 564 final bound volumes of U.S. Reports , covering cases through the end of October Term 2010 , which ended on September 28 , 2011 . </Li> <Li> 16 volumes ' worth of opinions available in slip opinion form ( volumes 565 -- 580 ) </Li> </Ul> <P> As of March 2012 , the U.S. Reports have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions , covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012 . This figure does not reflect the number of cases the Court has taken up , as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion ( see , for example , Parents v. Seattle , where Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education was also decided in the same opinion ; by a similar logic , Miranda v. Arizona actually decided not only Miranda but also three other cases : Vignera v. New York , Westover v. United States , and California v. Stewart ) . A more unusual example is The Telephone Cases , which comprise a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the U.S. Reports . </P> <P> Opinions are also collected and published in two unofficial , parallel reporters : Supreme Court Reporter , published by West ( now a part of Thomson Reuters ) , and United States Supreme Court Reports , Lawyers ' Edition ( simply known as Lawyers ' Edition ) , published by LexisNexis . In court documents , legal periodicals and other legal media , case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters ; for example , citation to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission is presented as Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n , 585 U.S. 50 , 130 S. Ct. 876 , 175 L. Ed . 2d 753 ( 2010 ) , with `` S. Ct . '' representing the Supreme Court Reporter , and `` L. Ed . '' representing the Lawyers ' Edition . </P> Citations to published opinions ( edit ) Main article : Case citation § Supreme Court of the United States <P> Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases , in the form `` vol U.S. page , pin ( year ) '' , where vol is the volume number , page is the page number on which the opinion begins , and year is the year in which the case was decided . Optionally , pin is used to `` pinpoint '' to a specific page number within the opinion . For instance , the citation for Roe v. Wade is 410 U.S. 113 ( 1973 ) , which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of U.S. Reports . For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print , the volume and page numbers may be replaced with `` ___ '' . </P> <H2> Institutional powers and constraints ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The power of judicial review , in fact , is nowhere mentioned in it . Over the ensuing years , the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way . Nevertheless , the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well - established precedent . Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review ; in Federalist No. 78 , Alexander Hamilton wrote : `` A Constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by the judges , as a fundamental law . It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning , as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body . If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two , that which has the superior obligation and validity ought , of course , to be preferred ; or , in other words , the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute . '' </P> <P> The Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , consummating the American system of checks and balances . In explaining the power of judicial review , Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts , part of the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . His contention was not that the Court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements , but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary , as well as the other branches of government , to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution . </P> <P> Since the founding of the republic , there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism , self - government , self - determination and freedom of conscience . At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being `` the most separated and least checked of all branches of government . '' Indeed , federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure `` during good behavior '' , and their pay may `` not be diminished '' while they hold their position ( Section 1 of Article Three ) . Though subject to the process of impeachment , only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office . At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch , with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government . The Supreme Court , it is noted , can not directly enforce its rulings ; instead , it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments . One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832 , when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court 's decision in Worcester v. Georgia . President Andrew Jackson , who sided with the Georgia courts , is supposed to have remarked , `` John Marshall has made his decision ; now let him enforce it ! '' ; however , this alleged quotation has been disputed . Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v. Board of Education . More recently , many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court 's order in United States v. Nixon ( 1974 ) to surrender the Watergate tapes . Nixon , however , ultimately complied with the Supreme Court 's ruling . </P> <P> Supreme Court decisions can be ( and have been ) purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment , which has happened on five occasions : </P> <Ul> <Li> Chisholm v. Georgia ( 1793 ) -- overturned by the Eleventh Amendment ( 1795 ) </Li> <Li> Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1857 ) -- overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment ( 1865 ) and the Fourteenth Amendment ( 1868 ) </Li> <Li> Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan & Trust Co. ( 1895 ) -- overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment ( 1913 ) </Li> <Li> Minor v. Happersett ( 1875 ) -- overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment ( 1920 ) </Li> <Li> Oregon v. Mitchell ( 1970 ) -- overturned by the Twenty - sixth Amendment ( 1971 ) </Li> </Ul> <P> When the Court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution , simple legislative action can reverse the decisions ( for example , in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter act , superseding the limitations given in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. in 2007 ) . Also , the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration : lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations , as do law enforcement officials . </P> <P> In addition , the other two branches can restrain the Court through other mechanisms . Congress can increase the number of justices , giving the President power to influence future decisions by appointments ( as in Roosevelt 's Court Packing Plan discussed above ) . Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases : this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three , where the appellate jurisdiction is granted `` with such Exceptions , and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make . '' The Court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction case ex parte McCardle ( 1869 ) , though it rejected Congress ' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in United States v. Klein ( 1871 ) . </P> <P> On the other hand , through its power of judicial review , the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government ; for example , in United States v. Curtiss - Wright Export Corp. ( 1936 ) , Dames & Moore v. Regan ( 1981 ) , and notably in Goldwater v. Carter ( 1979 ) , ( where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress or the Senate ) . The Court 's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority , as in Humphrey 's Executor v. United States ( 1935 ) , the Steel Seizure Case ( 1952 ) , and United States v. Nixon ( 1974 ) . </P> <H2> Law clerks ( edit ) </H2> See also : Law clerk and List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States <P> Each Supreme Court justice hires several law Clerks to review petitions for writ of certiorari , research them , prepare bench memorandums , and draft opinions . Associate justices are allowed four clerks . The chief justice is allowed five clerks , but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year , and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four . Generally , law clerks serve a term of one to two years . </P> <P> The first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in 1882 . Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. and Louis Brandeis were the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks , rather than hiring a `` stenographer - secretary '' . Most law clerks are recent law school graduates . </P> <P> The first female clerk was Lucile Lomen , hired in 1944 by Justice William O. Douglas . The first African - American , William T. Coleman , Jr. , was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter . A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools , especially Harvard , Yale , the University of Chicago , Columbia , and Stanford . From 1882 to 1940 , 62 % of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School . Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board . By the mid-1970s , clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice . </P> <P> Seven Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices : Byron White for Frederick M. Vinson , John Paul Stevens for Wiley Rutledge , William H. Rehnquist for Robert H. Jackson , Stephen Breyer for Arthur Goldberg , John G. Roberts , Jr. for William H. Rehnquist , Elena Kagan for Thurgood Marshall and Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and Anthony Kennedy . Gorsuch is the first justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he or she clerked . </P> <P> Several current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals : John G. Roberts , Jr. for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , Justice Samuel Alito for Judge Leonard I. Garth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , Elena Kagan for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , and Neil Gorsuch for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . </P> <H3> Politicization of the Court ( edit ) </H3> <P> Clerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft . `` Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s '' , according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School . `` As law has moved closer to mere politics , political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts '' , former federal court of appeals judge J. Michael Luttig said . David J. Garrow , professor of history at the University of Cambridge , stated that the Court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government . `` We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives '' , Professor Garrow said . `` Each side is putting forward only ideological purists . '' </P> <P> According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study , this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is `` a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law . '' A poll conducted in June 2012 by The New York Times and CBS News showed just 44 % of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing . Three - quarters said justices ' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views . </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> The court has been the object of criticisms on a range of issues . Among them : </P> <H3> Judicial activism ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism , rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint . Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology . An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York , which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers , including Robert Bork , Justice Antonin Scalia , and Chief Justice John Roberts , and which was reversed in the 1930s . An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) , which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the `` right to privacy '' inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment , a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous . Legal scholars , justices , and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision . The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater . More recently , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti ( 1978 ) that the First Amendment applies to corporations . Lincoln warned , referring to the Dred Scott decision , that if government policy became `` irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court ... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers . '' Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words : `` You do what you think is right and let the law catch up . '' During different historical periods , the Court has leaned in different directions . Critics from both sides complain that activist - judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead . Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano , Phyllis Schlafly , Mark R. Levin , Mark I. Sutherland , and James MacGregor Burns . Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism , including Franklin D. Roosevelt , Richard Nixon , and Ronald Reagan . Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote : `` What judges have wrought is a coup d'état , -- slow - moving and genteel , but a coup d'état nonetheless . '' Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism , `` their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like . '' One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects `` certainly a legislative body . '' </P> <H3> Failing to protect individual rights ( edit ) </H3> <P> Court decisions have been criticized for failing to protect individual rights : the Dred Scott ( 1857 ) decision upheld slavery ; Plessy v Ferguson ( 1896 ) upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal ; Kelo v. City of New London ( 2005 ) was criticized by prominent politicians , including New Jersey governor Jon Corzine , as undermining property rights . Some critics suggest the 2009 bench with a conservative majority has `` become increasingly hostile to voters '' by siding with Indiana 's voter identification laws which tend to `` disenfranchise large numbers of people without driver 's licenses , especially poor and minority voters '' , according to one report . Senator Al Franken criticized the Court for `` eroding individual rights . '' However , others argue that the Court is too protective of some individual rights , particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention . For example , Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule , and Justice Scalia criticized the Court 's decision in Boumediene v. Bush for being too protective of the rights of Guantanamo detainees , on the grounds that habeas corpus was `` limited '' to sovereign territory . </P> <H3> Supreme Court has too much power ( edit ) </H3> <P> This criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism . George Will wrote that the Court has an `` increasingly central role in American governance . '' It was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker Chrysler Corporation in 2009 . A reporter wrote that `` Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's intervention in the Chrysler bankruptcy '' left open the `` possibility of further judicial review '' but argued overall that the intervention was a proper use of Supreme Court power to check the executive branch . Warren E. Burger , before becoming Chief Justice , argued that since the Supreme Court has such `` unreviewable power '' it is likely to `` self - indulge itself '' and unlikely to `` engage in dispassionate analysis '' . Larry Sabato wrote `` excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts , especially the Supreme Court . '' </P> <H3> Courts are poor check on executive power ( edit ) </H3> <P> British constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts ( and specifically the Supreme Court ) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches ; he argues that because the courts must wait , sometimes for years , for cases to navigate their way through the system , their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened . In contrast , the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany for example , can directly declare a law unconstitutional upon request . </P> <H3> Federal versus state power ( edit ) </H3> <P> There has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power . While Framers such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton argued in The Federalist Papers that their then - proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments , others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers ' wishes . The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants `` powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . '' The Supreme Court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority . One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce , but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce ; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce . For example , the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act , thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin , Texas , despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines ; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005 . Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress 's power over interstate commerce was `` complete in itself , may be exercised to its utmost extent , and acknowledges no limitations , other than are prescribed in the Constitution . '' Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is `` quite broad . '' Modern day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today . Advocates of states ' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the Court , saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority . Justice Brandeis , in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference , suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy . One critic wrote `` the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state , not federal , law . '' However , others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends `` protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level . '' </P> <H3> Secretive proceedings ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view . According to a review of Jeffrey Toobin 's expose The Nine : Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court ; `` Its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover , like a closed `` cartel '' , only revealing itself through `` public events and printed releases , with nothing about its inner workings '' . The reviewer writes : `` few ( reporters ) dig deeply into court affairs . It all works very neatly ; the only ones hurt are the American people , who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives . '' Larry Sabato complains about the Court 's `` insularity . '' A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted in 2010 found that 61 % of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would `` be good for democracy '' , and 50 % of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised . In recent years , many justices have appeared on television , written books and made public statements to journalists . In a 2009 interview on C - SPAN , journalists Joan Biskupic ( of USA Today ) and Lyle Denniston ( of SCOTUSblog ) argued that the Court is a `` very open '' institution with only the justices ' private conferences inaccessible to others . In October 2010 , the Court began the practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the Friday after they occur . </P> <H3> Judicial interference in political disputes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Some Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the Court into the political arena , and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government . The Bush v. Gore decision , in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose George W. Bush over Al Gore , has been criticized extensively , particularly by liberals . Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting : in Baker v. Carr , the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions ; Justice Frankfurter in a `` scathing dissent '' argued against the court wading into so - called political questions . </P> <H3> Not choosing enough cases to review ( edit ) </H3> <P> Senator Arlen Specter said the Court should `` decide more cases '' . On the other hand , although Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the Court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the Supreme Court , he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case , nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards . He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s , at least in part , to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts . </P> <H3> Lifetime tenure ( edit ) </H3> <P> Critic Larry Sabato wrote : `` The insularity of lifetime tenure , combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench , produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day . '' Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity . James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has `` produced a critical time lag , with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times . '' Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices , as proposed by Levinson and Sabato as well as a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein , among others . However , others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits , such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure . Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78 wrote `` nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office . '' </P> <H3> Accepting gifts ( edit ) </H3> <P> The 21st century has seen increased scrutiny of justices accepting expensive gifts and travel . All of the members of the Roberts Court have accepted travel or gifts . In 2012 , Justice Sonia Sotomayor received $1.9 million in advances from her publisher Knopf Doubleday . Justice Scalia and others took dozens of expensive trips to exotic locations paid for by private donors . Private events sponsored by partisan groups that are attended by both the justices and those who have an interest in their decisions have raised concerns about access and inappropriate communications . Stephen Spaulding , the legal director at Common Cause , said : `` There are fair questions raised by some of these trips about their commitment to being impartial .

The previous motto , in Latin , was Ex Unitate Vires , translated as `` From unity , strength '' . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Blazon </Li> <Li> 3 The oval shape of foundation </Li> <Li> 4 The oval shape of ascendance </Li> <Li> 5 1910 arms <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Evolution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The design process was initiated when , in 1999 , the Department of Arts , Culture , Science and Technology requested ideas for the new coat - of - arms from the public . A brief was then prepared based on the ideas received , along with input from the Cabinet . The Government Communication and Information System then approached Design South Africa to brief ten of the top designers . Three designers were chosen to present their concepts to the Cabinet . Iaan Bekker 's design was chosen . </P> <P> The new arms were introduced on Freedom Day , 27 April 2000 . The change reflected the government 's aim to highlight the democratic change in South Africa and a new sense of patriotism . </P> <P> The coat of arms is a series of elements organised in distinct symmetric egg - like or oval shapes placed on top of one another . The completed structure of the coat of arms combines the lower and higher oval shape in a symbol of infinity . The path that connects the lower edge of the scroll , through the lines of the tusks , with the horizon above and the sun rising at the top , forms the shape of the cosmic egg from which the secretary bird rises . In the symbolic sense , this is the implied rebirth of the spirit of the great and heroic nation of South Africa . </P> <P> The coat of arms is also a central part of the Seal of the Republic , traditionally considered to be the highest emblem of the State . Absolute authority is given to every document with an impression of the Seal of the Republic on it , as this means that it has been approved by the President of South Africa . Since 1997 , however , the use of the Seal of the Republic has not actually been required by the Constitution , but it continues to be used . </P> <H2> Blazon ( edit ) </H2> <P> The official blazon of the arms is : </P> <P> Or , representations of two San human figures of red ochre , statant respectant , the hands of the innermost arms clasped , with upper arm , inner wrist , waist and knee bands Argent , and a narrow border of red ochre ; the shield ensigned of a spear and knobkierie in saltire , Sable . Thereabove a demi - secretary bird displayed Or , charged on the breast with a stylised representation of a protea flower with outer petals Vert , inner petals Or and seeded of nine triangles conjoined in three rows , the upper triangle Gules , the second row Vert , Or inverted and Vert , and the third row Vert , Or inverted , Sable , Or inverted and Vert . Above the head of the secretary bird an arc of seven rays facetted Or and Orange , the two outer rays conjoined to the elevated wings . </P> <P> Upon a riband Vert , the motto ! KE E : / XARRA / / KE in letters Argent . Issuant from the ends of the riband two pairs of elephant tusks curving inwards , the tips conjoined to the wings of the secretary bird , Or , therewithin and flanking the shields , two ears of wheat Brunatré . </P> <H2> The oval shape of foundation ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first element is the motto , in a green semicircle . Completing the semicircle are two symmetrically placed pairs of elephant tusks pointing upwards . Within the oval shape formed by the tusks are two symmetrical ears of wheat , that in turn frame a centrally placed gold shield . </P> <P> The shape of the shield makes reference to the drum , and contains two human figures from Khoisan rock art . The figures are depicted facing one another in greeting and in unity . </P> <P> Above the shield are a spear and a knobkierie , crossed in a single unit . These elements are arranged harmoniously to give focus to the shield and complete the lower oval shape of foundation . </P> <Ul> <Li> The motto </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The motto is : ! ke e : / xarra / / ke , written in the Khoisan language of the / Xam people , literally meaning `` diverse people unite '' . It addresses each individual effort to harness the unity between thought and action . On a collective scale it calls for the nation to unite in a common sense of belonging and national pride - unity in diversity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The ears of wheat </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> An emblem of fertility , it also symbolises the idea of germination , growth and the feasible development of any potential . It relates to the nourishment of the people and signifies : the agricultural aspects of the Earth . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Elephant tusks </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> Elephants symbolise wisdom , strength , moderation and eternity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The shield </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> It has a dual function as a vehicle for the display of identity and of spiritual defence . It contains the primary symbol of our nation . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The human figures </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The figures are depicted in an attitude of greeting , symbolising unity . This also represents the beginning of the individual 's transformation into the greater sense of : belonging to the nation and by extension , collective humanity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The spear and knobkierie </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> A dual symbol of defence and authority , they in turn represent the powerful legs of the secretary bird . The spear and knobkierie are lying down , symbolising peace . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> The oval shape of ascendance ( edit ) </H2> <P> Immediately above the oval shape of foundation , is the visual centre of the coat of arms , a protea . The petals of the protea are rendered in a triangular pattern reminiscent of the crafts of Africa . </P> <P> The secretary bird is placed above the protea and the flower forms the chest of the bird . The secretary bird stands with its wings uplifted in a regal and uprising gesture . The distinctive head feathers of the secretary bird crown a strong and vigilant head . The rising sun above the horizon is placed between the wings of the secretary bird and completes the oval shape of ascendance . </P> <P> The combination of the upper and lower oval shapes intersect to form an unbroken infinite course , and the great harmony between the basic elements result in a dynamic , elegant and thoroughly distinctive design . Yet it clearly retains the stability , gravity and immediacy that a coat of arms demands . </P> <Ul> <Li> The King protea </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The protea is an emblem of the beauty of our land and the flowering of our potential as a nation in pursuit of the African Renaissance . The protea symbolises the holistic : integration of forces that grow from the Earth and are nurtured from above . The most popular colours of Africa have been assigned to the protea -- green , gold , red and black . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The secretary bird </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The secretary bird is characterised in flight , the natural consequence of growth and speed . It is the equivalent of the lion on Earth . A powerful bird whose legs - depicted as the : spear and knobkierie - serve it well in its hunt for snakes , symbolising protection of the nation against its enemies . It is a messenger of the heavens and conducts its grace upon the Earth . In this sense it is a symbol of divine majesty . Its uplifted wings are an emblem of the ascendance of our nation , while simultaneously offering us its protection . It is : depicted in gold , which clearly symbolises its association with the sun and the highest power . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The rising sun </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> An emblem of brightness , splendour and the supreme principle of the nature of energy . It symbolises the promise of rebirth , the active faculties of reflection , knowledge , good judgement and willpower . It is the symbol of the source of life , of light and the ultimate wholeness of humanity . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> 1910 arms ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first coat of arms was granted by King George V by Royal Warrant on 17 September 1910 . This was a few months after the formation of the Union of South Africa . </P> <P> It was a combination of symbols representing the four provinces ( formerly colonies ) that made up the Union . </P> <Ul> <Li> The first quarter is the figure of Hope , representing the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope . </Li> <Li> The two wildebeests of the second quarter represent the Colony of Natal . </Li> <Li> The orange tree in the third quarter was used as the symbol of the Orange Free State Republic . </Li> <Li> The wagon in the fourth quarter represented the Transvaal . </Li> <Li> The supporters are taken from the arms of the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony . </Li> <Li> The lion holds four rods , bound together , symbolising the unification of the four former colonies . </Li> </Ul> <P> The motto , Ex Unitate Vires was officially translated as `` Union is Strength '' until 1961 , and thereafter as `` Unity is Strength '' . </P> <H3> Evolution ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Coat of arms of South Africa ( 1910 -- 2000 ) <P> Three official renditions of the arms were used . The original rendition ( 1910 ) was the only version used until 1930 , and it continued to be used as the rank badge of warrant officers in the South African Defence Force and South African National Defence Force until 2002 . The second version , painted in 1930 and known as the `` ordinary coat of arms '' , and the third version , painted in 1932 and known as the `` embellished coat of arms '' , were both used until 2000 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1910 </Td> <Td> 1930 </Td> <Td> 1932 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> South Africa portal </Li> <Li> Heraldry portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> South African heraldry </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Orange Free State </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Cape Colony </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of Natal </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Transvaal </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Orange River Colony </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Brownell , F.G.

when does model code of conduct come into force,immediately on announcement of the election schedule by the commission,"Election Commission of India 's Model code of Conduct - wikipedia <H1> Election Commission of India 's Model code of Conduct </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article needs more links to other articles to help integrate it into the encyclopedia . Please help improve this article by adding links that are relevant to the context within the existing text . ( April 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Election Commission of India 's Model Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India for conduct of political parties and candidates during elections mainly with respect to speeches , polling day , polling booths , election manifestos , processions and general conduct . These set of norms has been evolved with the consensus of political parties who have consented to abide by the principles embodied in the said code in its letter and spirit. The Model Code of Conduct comes into force immediately on announcement of the election schedule by the commission for the need of ensuring free and fair elections . Much of it is designed to avert communal clashes and corrupt practices . For example , politicians should not make hate speeches , putting one community against another or make promises about new projects that may sway a voter . </P> <P> For the 2014 general election the code came into force on 5 March 2014 when the Commission announced the dates and remains in force till the end of the electoral process . </P> <P> `` The Model Code of Conduct is crucial to make sure a level playing field among various contenders in the poll fray , '' said the Chief Election Commissioner V.S. Sampath at the press conference . </P> <H2> Main points ( edit ) </H2> <P> The main points of the code are : </P> <Ol> <Li> Government bodies are not to participate in any new recruitment process during the electoral process . </Li> <Li> The contesting candidates and the campaigners must respect the home life of their rivals and should not disturb them by holding road shows or demonstrations in front of their houses . The code tells the candidates to keep it . </Li> <Li> The election campaign rallies and road shows must not hinder the road traffic . </Li> <Li> Candidates are asked to refrain from distributing liquor to voters . It is a widely known fact in India that during election campaigning , liquor may be distributed to the voters . </Li> <Li> The election code in force hinders the government or running party leaders from launching new welfare programmes like construction of roads , provision of drinking water facilities etc. or any ribbon - cutting ceremonies . </Li> <Li> The code instructs that public spaces like meeting grounds , helipads , government guest houses and bungalows should be equally shared among the contesting candidates . These public spaces should not be monopolised by a few candidates . </Li> <Li> Any candidate or political party shall not use any place of worship for election propaganda . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/MCC-ENGLISH_28022014.pdf </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/541909/20140305/lok-sabha-election-2014-model-code-conduct.htm </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Election_Commission_of_India%27s_Model_Code_of_Conduct&oldid=829357661 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Elections in India </Li> <Li> Election Commission of India </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles with too few wikilinks from April 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles with too few wikilinks </Li> <Li> Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from April 2014 </Li> <Li> All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> हिन्दी </Li> <Li> मराठी </Li> <Li> ਪੰਜਾਬੀ </Li> </Ul> Edit links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 8 March 2018 , at 03 : 31 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul>"

The game will be televised in Canada nationally on TSN . </P> <P> The game is scheduled to be played at The Brick Field at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton , Alberta on Sunday , November 25 , 2018 . </P> <H2> Host city ( edit ) </H2> <P> On March 24 , 2017 , it was reported by several news outlets that the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos were bidding to host the 2018 Grey Cup game . In previous years , the games would be awarded based on regional preference or ownership changes ( such as Toronto hosting the 104th Grey Cup four years after hosting their previous one ) . However , beginning with the 2018 game , the league will have a bidding process based on the merits of the application to determine a host . Calgary last hosted the Grey Cup in 2009 while Edmonton last hosted in 2010 . Both cities have previously hosted the Grey Cup game four times . </P> <P> Despite having a new stadium , and not having hosted the Grey Cup game since 1996 , it was reported that the Hamilton Tiger - Cats would not submit a bid for the 106th Grey Cup due to ongoing lawsuits filed against the construction firms that completed the stadium more than a year behind schedule . Tiger - Cats CEO , Scott Mitchell , relayed that the organization was focused on the lawsuits first and foremost , and once those are completed they will focus on hosting a Grey Cup in the near future . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Scott , Morley ; Mertz , Emily ( June 5 , 2017 ) . `` Edmonton officially named 2018 Grey Cup host city '' .

It generally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the U.S. states of Colorado , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Arkansas . The river 's source basin lies in the western United States in Colorado , specifically the Arkansas River Valley , where the headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges . It then flows east into the Midwest via Kansas , and finally into the South through Oklahoma and Arkansas . </P> <P> At 1,469 miles ( 2,364 km ) , it is the sixth - longest river in the United States , the second - longest tributary in the Mississippi -- Missouri system , and the 45th longest river in the world . Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County , Colorado , near Leadville . In 1859 , placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich , but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted . The Arkansas River 's mouth is at Napoleon , Arkansas , and its drainage basin covers nearly 170,000 sq mi ( 440,300 km2 ) . In terms of volume , the river is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio Rivers , with a mean discharge of roughly 41,000 cubic feet per second ( 1,200 m / s ) . </P> <P> The Arkansas from its headwaters to the 100th meridian west formed part of the U.S. - Mexico border from the Adams -- Onís Treaty ( in force 1821 ) until the Texas Annexation or Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Pronunciations </Li> <Li> 2 Hydrography </Li> <Li> 3 Allocation problems </Li> <Li> 4 Riverway commerce </Li> <Li> 5 The river in history <Ul> <Li> 5.1 American Civil War </Li> <Li> 5.2 Post Civil War </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Angling </Li> <Li> 7 Image gallery </Li> <Li> 8 Notes </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Pronunciations ( edit ) </H2> <P> Name pronunciation varies by region . Many people in western states , including Kansas and Colorado , pronounce it / ɑːr ˈkænzəs / ar - KAN - zəs , People in Oklahoma and Arkansas typically pronounce it / ˈɑːrkənsɔː / AR - kən - saw , which is how the state is always pronounced according to a state law passed in 1881 . </P> <H2> Hydrography ( edit ) </H2> The headwaters of the Arkansas near Leadville , Colorado <P> The Arkansas has three distinct sections in its long path through central North America . At its headwaters , the Arkansas runs as a steep fast - flowing mountain river through the Rockies in its narrow valley , dropping 4,600 feet ( 1.4 km ) in 120 miles ( 193 km ) . This section supports extensive whitewater rafting , including The Numbers ( near Granite , Colorado ) , Brown 's Canyon , and the Royal Gorge . </P> <P> At Cañon City , Colorado , the Arkansas River valley widens and flattens markedly . Just west of Pueblo , Colorado , the river enters the Great Plains . Through the rest of Colorado , Kansas , and much of Oklahoma , it is a typical Great Plains riverway , with wide , shallow banks subject to seasonal flooding and periods of dwindling flow . Tributaries include the Cimarron River and the Salt Fork Arkansas River . </P> <P> In eastern Oklahoma the river begins to widen further into a more contained consistent channel . To maintain more reliable flow rates , a series of large reservoir lakes have been built on the Arkansas and its intersecting tributaries including the Canadian , Verdigris , Neosho ( Grand ) , Illinois , and Poteau rivers . These locks and dams allow the river to be navigable by barges and large river craft downriver of Muskogee , Oklahoma , where the McClellan - Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System joins in with the Verdigris River . </P> <P> Into western Arkansas , the river path works between the encroaching Boston and Ouachita Mountains , including many isolated , flat - topped mesas , buttes , or monadnocks such as Mount Nebo , Petit Jean Mountain , and Mount Magazine , the highest point in the state . The river valley then expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock , Arkansas . It continues eastward across the plains and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River . </P> <P> Water flow in the Arkansas River ( as measured in central Kansas ) has dropped from approximately 248 cubic feet per second ( 7 m3 / s ) average from 1944 - 1963 to 53 cubic feet per second ( 1.5 m3 / s ) average from 1984 -- 2003 , largely because of the pumping of groundwater for irrigation in eastern Colorado and western Kansas . </P> <P> Important cities along the Arkansas River include Pueblo , Colorado , Garden City , Kansas , Dodge City , Kansas , Wichita , Kansas , Tulsa , Oklahoma , Fort Smith , Arkansas , and Little Rock , Arkansas . </P> <P> The I - 40 bridge disaster of May 2002 took place on I - 40 's crossing of Kerr Reservoir on the Arkansas River near Webbers Falls , Oklahoma . </P> <H2> Allocation problems ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since 1902 , Kansas has claimed Colorado takes too much of the river 's water , resulting in a number of lawsuits before the U.S. Supreme Court that continue to this day , generally under the name of Kansas v. Colorado . The problems over the possession and use of Arkansas River water by Colorado and Kansas led to the creation of an interstate compact or agreement between the two states . While Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact in 1949 , the compact did not stop further disputes by the two states over water rights to the river . </P> <P> The Kansas - Oklahoma Arkansas River Basin Compact was created in 1965 to promote mutual consideration and equity over water use in the basin shared by those states . It led to the Kansas - Oklahoma Arkansas River Commission , which was charged with administering the compact and reducing pollution . The compact was approved and implemented by both states in 1970 , and has been in force since then . </P> <H2> Riverway Commerce ( edit ) </H2> Inland waterway system with McClellan - Kerr Navigational Channel shown in red <P> The McClellan - Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System begins at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River , enters the Arkansas River near Muskogee , and runs via an extensive lock and dam system to the Mississippi River . Through Oklahoma and Arkansas , dams which artificially deepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and recreational use give the river the appearance of a series of reservoirs . </P> <P> The McClellan - Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System diverts from the Arkansas River 2.5 mi ( 4.0 km ) upstream of the Wilbur D. Mills Dam to avoid the long winding route which the lower Arkansas River follows . This circuitous portion of the Arkansas River between the Wilbur D. Mills Dam and the Mississippi River was historically bypassed by river vessels ; early steamboats instead following a network of rivers -- known as the Arkansas Post Canal -- which flowed north of the lower Arkansas River and followed a shorter and more direct route to the Mississippi River . When the McClellan -- Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System was constructed between 1963 and 1970 , the Arkansas Post Canal was significantly improved , while the lower Arkansas River continued to be bypassed by commercial vessels . </P> <H2> The River in History ( edit ) </H2> Devil 's Punch Bowl falls , Grand Canyon of the Arkansas River in Colorado , from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views <P> Many nations of Native Americans lived near , or along , the 1,450 - mile ( 2334 - km ) stretch of the Arkansas River for thousands of years . The first Europeans to see the river were members of the Spanish Coronado expedition on June 29 , 1541 . Also in the 1540s , Hernando de Soto discovered the junction of the Arkansas with the Mississippi . The Spanish originally called the river Napeste . `` The name `` Arkansas '' was first applied by Father Jacques Marquette , who called the river Akansa in his journal of 1673 . The Joliet - Marquette expedition travelled the Mississippi River from Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin towards the Gulf of Mexico , but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River . By that time , they had encountered Native Americans carrying European trinkets , and feared confrontation with Spanish conquistadors . </P> <P> Jean - Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe , a French trader , explorer and nobleman had led an expedition into what is now Oklahoma in 1718 - 19 . His original objective was to establish a trading post near the present city of Texarkana , Arkansas , but he then extended his trip overland as far north as the Arkansas River ( which he designated as the Alcansas ) . The explorer wrote he and 9 other men , including three Caddo guides and 22 horses loaded with trade goods had come to a native settlement overlooking the river , where there were about 6,000 natives , who gave the strangers a warm welcome . La Harpe 's party were honored with the calumet ceremony and spent ten days at this location . In 1988 , evidence of a native village was discovered along the Arkansas River 13 miles ( 21 km ) south of present - day Tulsa , Oklahoma . By then , the site was known as the Lasley Vore Site . </P> <P> French traders and trappers who had opened up trade with Indian tribes in Canada and the areas around the Great Lakes began exploring the Mississippi and some of its northern tributaries . They soon learned that the birch - bark canoes , which had served them so well on the northern waterways , were too light for use on the southern rivers , such as the Arkansas . They turned to making and using dugout canoes , which they called pirogues , made by hollowing out the trunks of cottonwood trees . Cottonwoods are plentiful along the streams of the southwest and grow to large sizes . The wood is soft and easily worked with the crude tools carried by both the French and Indians . The pirogues The pirogues were sturdier and could be more for navigating the sandbars and snags of the Southern waterways . </P> <P> In 1819 , the Adams - Onís Treaty set the Arkansas as part of the frontier between the United States and Spanish Mexico . This continued until the United States annexed Texas after the Mexican - American War , in 1846 . The treaty was made shortly after `` Old Settler '' Cherokees moved to near what became known as Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River . That area , then part of Arkansas Territory would become Indian Territory and later Oklahoma , was traditional territory of the Osage , leading to conflict and a treaty in 1828 but still unresolved by the time thousands of additional Cherokee refugees moved to the area during the Trail of Tears . </P> <P> By the time Fort Smith was established in 1817 , larger capacity watercraft became available to transport goods up and down the Arkansas . These included flatboats ( bateaus ) and keelboats . Along with the pirogues , they transported piles of deer , bear , otter , beaver and buffalo skins up and down the river . Agricultural products such as corn , rice , dried peaches , beans , peanuts , snake root , sarsaparilla , ginseng had grown in economic importance . </P> <P> On March 31 , 1820 , the Comet became the first steamboat to successfully navigate part of the Arkansas River , reaching a place called Arkansas Post , ( ( efn Arkansas Post is said to have been the first European settlement in the Mississippi Valley , about 60 miles ( 97 km ) above the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi Rivers . In mid-April , 1822 , the Robert Thompson , towing a keelboat , was the first steamboat to navigate the Arkansas as far as Fort Smith . For five years , Fort Smith was known as the head of navigation for steamboats on the river . It lost the title to Fort Gibson in April , 1832 , when three steamboats , Velocipede , Scioto and Catawba , all arrived at Fort Gibson later that month. ( ( efn Fort Gibson had been built in 1824 on the bank of the Verdigris River in what had been called the `` Three Forks '' area of Indian Territory . </P> <P> Later , the Santa Fe Trail followed the Arkansas through much of Kansas , picking it up near Great Bend and continuing through to La Junta , Colorado , unless users elected to take the challenging Cimarron Cutoff in Cimarron , Kansas . </P> <H3> American Civil War ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Ambush of the steamboat J.R. Williams <P> During the American Civil War , each side tried to prevent the other from using the Arkansas and its tributaries as a route for moving reinforcements . Initially , the Union Army abandoned its forts in the Indian Territory , including Fort Gibson and Fort Smith , in order to maximize its strength for campaigns elsewhere , while the Confederate Army sent troops from Texas to support its Native American allies . Union Troops returned later in the war , after defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Fort Smith , and began recovering the position it had previously abandoned , most notably Fort Gibson , reopening the Arkansas River as a supply route . In September 1864 , a body of Confederate irregulars led by General Stand Watie successfully ambushed a Union supply ship bound for Fort Gibson . The vessel was destroyed , and a part of its cargo was looted by the Confederates . </P> <H3> Post Civil War ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1880s , Charles `` Buffalo '' Jones , one of the cofounders of Garden City , Kansas , organized four irrigation companies to take water one hundred miles from the Arkansas River to cultivate 75,000 acres ( 300 km ) of land . By 1890 , water from the Arkansas was being used to irrigate more than 20 × 10 acres ( 8.1 × 10 ha ) of farmland in Kansas . By 1910 , irrigation projects in Colorado had caused the river to stop flowing in July and August . </P> <P> Flooding in 1927 severely damaged or destroyed nearly every levee downstream of Fort Smith , and led to the development of the Arkansas River Flood Control Association . It also led to the Federal Government assigning responsibility of flood control and navigation on the Arkansas to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACOE ) . </P> Fly fishermen on the Arkansas River near Salida , Colorado <H2> Angling ( edit ) </H2> <P> The headwaters of the Arkansas River in central Colorado have been known for exceptional trout fishing , particularly fly fishing , since the 19th century , when greenback cutthroat trout dominated the river . Today , brown trout dominate the river , which also contains rainbow trout . Trout Unlimited considers the Arkansas one of the top 100 trout streams in America , a reputation the river has had since the 1950s . From Leadville to Pueblo , the Arkansas River is serviced by numerous fly shops and guides operating in Buena Vista , Salida , Cañon City and Pueblo . The Colorado Division of Wildlife provides regular online fishing reports for the river . </P> <P> A fish kill occurred on December 29 , 2010 , in which an estimated 100,000 freshwater drum lined the Arkansas River bank . An investigation , conducted by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission , found the dead fish `` ... cover 17 miles of river from the Ozark Lock and Dam downstream to River Mile 240 , directly south of Hartman , Arkansas . '' Tests later indicated the likely cause of the kill was gas bubble trauma caused by opening the spillways on the Ozark Dam . </P> <H2> Image gallery ( edit ) </H2> The Arkansas River passing through Little Rock , Arkansas , as viewed from the north bank in North Little Rock The Yancopin Bridge is the last crossing of the Arkansas River before it flows into the Mississippi River <Ul> <Li> <P> Arkansas River in downtown Pueblo , Colorado </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Downtown Wichita , Kansas , skyline at night from The Keeper of the Plains at the Arkansas River </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Arkansas River , looking across to North Little Rock </P> </Li> <Li> <P> John Martin Dam and Reservoir on the Arkansas River in Bent County , Colorado </P> </Li> <Li> <P> The Arkansas River in Tulsa , Oklahoma </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Royal Gorge </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Arkansas River in Salida , Colorado </P> </Li> <Li> <P> The Arkansas River in Natural Steps , Arkansas </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Arkansas River between Van Buren and Fort Smith , Arkansas </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ A team led by Dr. George H.

There , she will await her reign once her grandmother , Queen Clarisse , steps down as Queen . During Mia 's twenty first birthday party , she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband . She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas . During the course of the night , Mia 's tiara falls off and is caught by a Member of Parliament , Viscount Mabrey , who secretly plans to steal Mia 's crown . While the Parliament is in - session the next morning , Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in . Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew , Lord Devereaux , is another heir to the Genovian throne . Despite Queen Clarisse 's objection , the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month . Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace , while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is actually Nicholas . Mia 's best friend , Lilly Moscovitz , surprises her by visiting . Together , they pick through potential husbands . Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby , Duke of Kenilworth , and days later , they are engaged . Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement . </P> <P> For a ceremony , Mia is to ride sidesaddle , but is inexperienced . Queen Clarisse provides an ancestral wooden leg decoy to make it look like she 's riding sidesaddle . Mabrey spooks Mia 's horse with a rubber snake , and Joe rushes to aid Mia , but accidentally tears off the wooden leg . Humiliated , Mia flees to the stables , where Nicholas fails to comfort her . At a garden party , Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia 's relationship with Andrew ; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she does n't love Andrew . Frustrated , she argues , but instead gets bombarded by a kiss . At first , she kisses him back but then backs away . Nicholas pursues her even more , which causes both of them to fall into a fountain . Queen Clarisse finally tells Mia that her behavior with Nicholas needs to stop . </P> <P> During the Genovian Independence Day parade , Mia sees some boys harassing a little girl , and abruptly halts the parade to comfort the girl . Learning that the children are orphans , Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with her in the parade . Everyone is impressed by her act of generosity , while Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver . Mia later decides to convert one of the royal palaces into a temporary children 's center . That night , Mia has her bachelorette party , where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a duet with Princess Asana , one of Mia 's good friends . In the meantime , Mabrey realizes Nicholas has fallen for Mia , but Nicholas says that Mia will never love him . Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practicing her archery as part of her coronation rites . He helps her succeed in getting the arrow to hit the bullseye , something she had been struggling with . Nicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving , but asks to see her just one more time before he goes . She declines , saying she is under close guard . </P> <P> That night , Nicholas appears outside Mia 's window and asks her to come out . Lilly encourages her to go , and Mia sneaks out . They ride out to a lake where they share secrets , dance , and eventually fall asleep . They awaken to find a man in a boat videotaping them . Mia thinks Nicholas set her up , while he insists he had no idea . By the time Mia returns to the palace , the scandalous footage is already being broadcast . Andrew is disappointed and kisses Mia to see if there is a romantic spark between them . They realize that they do not love each other , but do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia . The wedding is to take place the following day , and Mia 's mother , Helen comes with her new husband , Patrick and their newborn son , Trevor . Nicholas decides against attending , but his surly housekeeper , Gretchen informs him that Mabrey engineered their televised scandal . </P> <P> Before the wedding , Joe informs Mia that Nicholas is innocent . Queen Clarisse encourages Mia to follow her heart , something she has never done and has now cost her Joe , the only man she truly loved . Mia reenters the church , and after pointing out how her grandmother has ruled Genovia while unmarried for a number of years , she tells the members of parliament in the audience to consider the significant women in their lives and questions if they would have them do what they 're trying to force her to do ( marry someone she does not love ) . Mabrey cites the law again and once again suggests that his nephew be named King , but just then , Nicholas not only refuses the crown , but also disowns Mabrey as his uncle . Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be abolished , and the Parliament unanimously gives its assent . Encouraged by Mia to have her own happy ending , Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly married . </P> <P> About a week later , Mia is preparing for her coronation when Nicholas shows up . He professes his love for Mia on bended knee , and they share a romantic kiss . The next day , Mia is crowned `` Her Majesty Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi , Queen of Genovia '' , with all in attendance in the royal palace . </P> <P> An epilogue shows that Genovian Parliament now allows female members , one of whom is Charlotte . And Queen Mia officially opens the children 's home . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Anne Hathaway as Princess / Queen Amelia `` Mia '' Thermopolis Renaldi </Li> <Li> Julie Andrews as Queen Clarisse Renaldi </Li> <Li> Héctor Elizondo as Joe </Li> <Li> John Rhys - Davies as Viscount Mabrey </Li> <Li> Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz </Li> <Li> Chris Pine as Nicholas Devereaux </Li> <Li> Callum Blue as Andrew Jacoby </Li> <Li> Raven - Symoné as Princess Asana </Li> <Li> Kathleen Marshall as Charlotte Kutaway </Li> <Li> Jonny Blu as himself </Li> <Li> Tom Poston as Lord Palimore </Li> <Li> Joel McCrary as Prime Minister Motaz </Li> <Li> Kim Thomson as Reporter Elsie Kentworthy </Li> <Li> Larry Miller as Paolo Puttanesca </Li> <Li> Caroline Goodall as Helen Thermopolis O'Connell </Li> <Li> Meredith Patterson as Lady Elissa </Li> <Li> Spencer Breslin as Prince Jacques </Li> <Li> Tracy Reiner as Lady Anthony </Li> <Li> Paul Vogt as Lord Crawley </Li> <Li> Paul Williams as Lord Harmony </Li> <Li> Peter Allen Vogt as Mr. Crawley </Li> <Li> Anna Netrebko as herself </Li> <Li> Abigail Breslin as Carolina , the orphan child </Li> <Li> Hannah Schneider as Dancing Princess Hannah </Li> <Li> Charlee Corra Disney as Princess Charlee </Li> <Li> Aimee Adams Hall as Princess Aimee </Li> <Li> Nadege August as Princess Nadege </Li> <Li> Claudia Katz Minnick as Freda Kout </Li> <Li> Stan Lee as Three Stooges wedding guest </Li> </Ul> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film opened in 3,472 theaters in North America and grossed $22,956,453 in its opening weekend .

In an interview with Variety Latino , He said on the possibility , `` I know Anne would like to do it . I know Julie would like to do it . I would like to do it . So we 're on board , it 's a question of when and a question of getting a good story . I 'm ready ! It 's time to go back to Genovia !

the p-wave phase of an electrocardiogram (ecg) represents,atrial depolarization,"P wave ( electrocardiography ) - wikipedia <H1> P wave ( electrocardiography ) </H1> Normal P wave , shown in darker red <P> The P wave in the ECG represents atrial depolarization , which results in atrial contraction , or atrial systole . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Physiology </Li> <Li> 2 Pathology </Li> <Li> 3 Atrial repolarization </Li> <Li> 4 Related pages </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Physiology ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article needs additional citations for verification .

( February 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The P wave is a summation wave generated by the depolarization front as it transits the atria . Normally the right atrium depolarizes slightly earlier than left atrium since the depolarization wave originates in the sinoatrial node , in the high right atrium and then travels to and through the left atrium . The depolarization front is carried through the atria along semi-specialized conduction pathways including Bachmann 's bundle resulting in uniform shaped waves . Depolarization originating elsewhere in the atria ( atrial ectopics ) result in P waves with a different morphology from normal . </P> <H2> Pathology ( edit ) </H2> Characteristic peaked P wave of cor pulmonale <P> Peaked P waves ( > 0.25 mV ) suggest right atrial enlargement , cor pulmonale , ( P pulmonale rhythm ) , but have a low predictive value ( ~ 20 % ) . </P> <P> AP wave with increased amplitude can indicate hypokalemia . It can also indicate right atrial enlargement . </P> <P> AP wave with decreased amplitude can indicate hyperkalemia . </P> <P> Bifid P waves ( known as P mitrale ) indicate left - atrial abnormality - e.g. dilatation or hypertrophy . </P> <P> If at least three different shaped P waves can be seen in a given ECG lead tracing , this implies that even if one of them arises from the SA node , at least two others are arising elsewhere . This is taken as evidence of multiple ( i.e. at least two ) ectopic foci , and is called multifocal ( or more correctly , multiform ) atrial rhythm if the rate is ≤ 100 ) or multifocal atrial tachycardia if the rate is over 100 . This appears particularly commonly in exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease . </P> <P> If the baseline has a totally irregular form , this suggests fibrillatory waves of atrial fibrillation or possibly artefact ; a saw tooth shaped baseline suggests the flutter waves of atrial flutter . With either of these rhythms , if the ventricular rate is fast , the fibrillatory or flutter waves can easily be misinterpreted as P waves . </P> <P> Absence of the P wave with a flat baseline may indicate : </P> <Ul> <Li> Fine atrial fibrillation </Li> <Li> Sinoatrial arrest ( with a secondary escape rhythm ) </Li> </Ul> <P> If P waves are not clearly delineated in the surface ECG , a Lewis lead may be used to better visualize P waves . </P> <H2> Atrial Repolarization ( edit ) </H2> <P> This occurs a mean of 320 ms after the end of the P wave , with a duration of 2 - 3 times that of the P wave and a polarity always opposite to that of the P wave . It is represented on the surface ECG by a so - called Ta wave . The clinical relevance of this is that , although a normal phenomenon , the nadir of the Ta wave can occur just after the QRS complex and cause ST depression similar to ( and easily mistaken with ) that occurring with disease states such as cardiac ischaemia . </P> <H2> Related pages ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Electrocardiography </Li> <Li> PR interval </Li> <Li> QRS complex </Li> <Li> QT interval </Li> <Li> ST segment </Li> <Li> T wave </Li> <Li> U wave </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Longmore , Murray ( 2004 ) .

Roddenberry , Maurice Hurley , Rick Berman , Michael Piller , and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at different times throughout its production . </P> <P> The show was very popular , reaching almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season , and the season seven finale in 1994 was watched by over 30 million viewers . The show spawned two reasonably popular spin - offs set in the same sci - fi universe time and place , and 4 theater films with the cast of the show . In the early 2000s the show Enterprise , although more oriented towards re-booting the series was also in the same fictional universe , but an earlier time . </P> <P> The series involves a starship named Enterprise and is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy , the Alpha Quadrant . The first episode takes place in the year 2364 , 99 years after the start of the five - year mission described in the original series , which began in 2265 . </P> <P> It features a new cast and a new starship Enterprise , the fifth to bear the name within the franchise 's storyline . An introductory statement , delivered by Patrick Stewart and featured at the beginning of each episode 's title sequence , stated the starship 's purpose in language similar to the opening statement of The Original Series , but was updated to reflect an ongoing mission , and to be gender - neutral : </P> <P> Space : the final frontier . These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission : to explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life and new civilizations , to boldly go where no one has gone before . </P> <P> TNG premiered the week of September 28 , 1987 , drawing 27 million viewers , with the two - hour pilot `` Encounter at Farpoint '' . In total , 176 episodes were made ( including several two - parters ) , ending with the two - hour finale `` All Good Things ... '' the week of May 23 , 1994 . </P> <P> The series ( 1987 -- 94 ) was broadcast in first - run syndication with dates and times varying among individual television stations . Further Star Trek spin - offs followed The Next Generation : Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ( 1993 -- 99 ) , Star Trek : Voyager ( 1995 -- 2001 ) , Star Trek : Enterprise ( 2001 -- 2005 ) , and Star Trek : Discovery ( 2017 -- present ) . The series formed the basis for the seventh through the tenth of the Star Trek films , and is also the setting of numerous novels , comic books , and video games . </P> <P> In its seventh season , Star Trek : The Next Generation became the first and only syndicated television series to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series .

( See Starship Enterprise for other ships with the name and / or registry ) . The series is set about 70 years after the final mission of the original Enterprise crew under the command of James T. Kirk . The Federation has undergone significant internal changes in its quest to explore and seek out new life , adding new degrees of complexity and controversy to its methods , especially those focused on the Prime Directive . The Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets have ceased wartime hostilities and become galactic allies , while more sinister foes such as the Romulans and the Borg take precedence on the series . </P> <P> The Enterprise is commanded by Captain Jean - Luc Picard and is staffed by first officer Commander William Riker , second officer / operations manager Data , security chief Tasha Yar , ship 's counselor Deanna Troi , chief medical officer Dr. Beverly Crusher and her son Wesley Crusher , conn officer Lieutenant Geordi La Forge , and junior officer Lieutenant Worf . The death of Lieutenant Yar in the twenty - third episode of the first season ( 1987 - 1988 ) of the series prompts an internal shuffle of personnel , making Worf official chief of security . In season two , La Forge is promoted to chief engineer and Katherine Pulaski briefly takes over for Beverly Crusher . </P> <P> The series begins with the crew of the Enterprise - D put on trial by an omnipotent being known as Q , who became a recurring character . The god - like entity threatens the extinction of mankind for being a race of savages , forcing them to solve a mystery at nearby Farpoint Station to prove their worthiness to be spared . After successfully solving the mystery and avoiding disaster , the crew officially departs on its mission to explore strange new worlds . </P> <P> Subsequent stories focus on the discovery of new life and sociological and political relationships with alien cultures , as well as exploring the human condition . Several new species are introduced as recurring antagonists , including the Ferengi , the Cardassians , and the Borg . Throughout their adventures , Picard and his crew are often forced to face and live with the consequences of difficult choices . </P> <P> The series ended in its seventh season with a two - part episode `` All Good Things ... '' , which brought the events of the series full circle to the original confrontation with Q. An interstellar anomaly that threatens all life in the universe forces Picard to leap from his present , past , and future to combat the threat . Picard was successfully able to show to Q that humanity could think outside of the confines of perception and theorize on new possibilities while still being prepared to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater good . The series ended with the crew of the Enterprise portrayed as feeling more like a family and paved the way for four consecutive motion pictures that continued the theme and mission of the series . </P> <Table> Episodes by Season ( 1 -

( L to R : LeVar Burton , Michael Dorn , Marina Sirtis , Brent Spiner , and Wil Wheaton ) in 2012 <H3> Background ( edit ) </H3> <P> By 1986 , 20 years after Star Trek 's debut on NBC , the franchise 's longevity amazed Paramount Pictures executives . Chairman Frank Mancuso Sr. and others described it as the studio 's `` crown jewel '' , a `` priceless asset '' that `` must not be squandered '' . The series was the most popular syndicated television program 17 years after cancellation , and the Harve Bennett - produced Star Trek films did well at the box office . William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy 's salary demands for Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home ( 1986 ) caused the studio to plan for a new Star Trek television series , as it had thought to do in 1977 with Star Trek : Phase II before making the films . Paramount executives worried that a new show could hurt the demand for the films , but decided that it would increase their appeal on videocassette and cable , and that a show with unknown actors would be more profitable than paying the films ' actors ' large salaries . Roddenberry initially declined to be involved , but came on board as creator after being unhappy with early conceptual work . Star Trek : The Next Generation was announced on October 10 , 1986 , and its cast in May 1987 . </P> <P> Paramount executive Rick Berman was assigned to the show at Roddenberry 's request . Roddenberry hired a number of Star Trek veterans , including Bob Justman , D.C. Fontana , Eddie Milkis , and David Gerrold . Early proposals for the series included one in which some of the original series cast might appear as `` elder statesmen '' , and Roddenberry speculated as late as October 1986 that the new series might not even use a spaceship , as `` people might travel by some ( other ) means '' 100 years after the USS Enterprise ( NCC - 1701 ) . A more lasting change was his new belief that workplace interpersonal conflict would no longer exist in the future ; thus , the new series did not have parallels to the frequent `` crusty banter '' between Kirk , Spock , and Leonard McCoy . According to series actor Patrick Stewart , Berman was more receptive than Roddenberry to the show addressing political issues . </P> <P> The series ' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by Alexander Courage with Jerry Goldsmith 's theme for Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) . Some early episodes ' plots derived from outlines created for Star Trek : Phase II . Additionally , some sets used in the Original Series - era films were redressed for The Next Generation , and in turn used for subsequent Original Series films . Part of the transporter room set in TNG was used in the original Star Trek 's transporter set . Many production details , such as LCARS computer interfaces and starship design , were carried through in the production of subsequent spin - offs . </P> <P> A major focus of the show is the faster - than - light starship visiting exoplanets , which , although some had speculated to exist , were still in the realm of science fiction when show started in the 1987 . However , by the early 1990s more claims were coming out including for PSR B1257 + 12 , and a year after the show ended there was a more definitive detection of planets around 51 Pegasi . Another example is the ubiquitous use of hand - held tablet computers , at the time a fictional technology props for the actors but became a more practical and common computing device by the 2010s </P> <H3> Syndication and profitability ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite Star Trek 's proven success , NBC and ABC only offered to consider pilot scripts for the new series , and CBS offered to air a miniseries that could become a series if it did well . That the Big Three television networks treated Paramount 's most appealing and valuable property as they would any other series offended the studio . Fox wanted the show to help launch the new network , but wanted it by March 1987 , and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season . The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect Star Trek with full control . </P> <P> Paramount increased and accelerated the show 's profitability by choosing to instead broadcast it in first - run syndication on independent stations ( whose numbers had more than tripled since 1980 ) and Big Three network affiliates . The studio offered the show to local stations for free as barter syndication . The stations sold five minutes of commercial time to local advertisers and Paramount sold the remaining seven minutes to national advertisers . Stations had to commit to purchasing reruns in the future , and only those that aired the new show could purchase the popular reruns of the original series . </P> <P> The studio 's strategy succeeded . Most of the 150 stations airing reruns of the original Star Trek wanted to prevent a competitor from airing the new show ; ultimately , 210 stations covering 90 % of the United States became part of Paramount 's informal nationwide network for TNG . In early October 1987 , more than 50 network affiliates pre-empted their own shows for the series pilot , `` Encounter at Farpoint '' . One station predicted that `` ' Star Trek ' promises to be one of the most successful programs of the season , network or syndicated . '' TNG helped stations like WZZM in Grand Rapids , Michigan , who made a decision show The Next Generation . </P> <P> The new show indeed performed well ; the pilot 's ratings were higher than those of many network programs , and ratings remained comparable to network shows by the end of the first season , despite the handicap of each station airing the show on a different day and time , often outside prime time . By the end of the first season , Paramount reportedly received $1 million for advertising per episode , more than the roughly $800,000 fee that networks typically paid for a one - hour show ; by 1992 , when the budget for each episode had risen to almost $2 million , the studio earned $90 million from advertising annually from first - run episodes , with each 30 - second commercial selling for $115,000 to $150,000 . The show had a 40 % return on investment for Paramount , with $30 to $60 million in annual upfront net profit for first - run episodes and another $70 million for stripping rights for each of the about 100 episodes then available , so did not need overseas sales to be successful . </P> <H3> Season one ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( season 1 ) Gates and Denise were in Season 1 as Doctor Crusher and Tasha Yar , respectively , but were removed for Season 2 . <P> The Next Generation was shot on 35mm film , and the budget for each episode was $1.3 million , among the largest for a one - hour television drama . While the staff enjoyed the creative freedom gained by independence from a broadcast network 's Standards and Practices department , the first season was marked by a `` revolving door '' of writers , with Gerrold , Fontana , and others quitting after disputes with Roddenberry . Roddenberry `` virtually rewrote '' the first 15 episodes because of his `` dogmatic '' intention to depict human interaction `` without drawing on the baser motives of greed , lust , and power '' . Writers found the show 's `` bible '' constricting and ridiculous and could n't deal with Roddenberry 's ego and treatment of them . It stated , for example , that `` regular characters all share a feeling of being part of a band of brothers and sisters . As in the original ' Star Trek , ' we invite the audience to share the same feeling of affection for our characters . '' </P> <P> Mark Bourne of The DVD Journal wrote of season one : `` A typical episode relied on trite plot points , clumsy allegories , dry and stilted dialogue , or characterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural . '' Other targets of criticism included poor special effects and plots being resolved by the deus ex machina of Wesley Crusher saving the ship . However , Patrick Stewart 's acting skills won praise , and critics noted that characters were given greater potential for development than those of the original series . Both actors and producers were unsure whether Trekkies loyal to the original show would accept the new one , but one critic stated as early as October 1987 that The Next Generation , not the movies or the original show , `` is the real ' Star Trek ' now '' . </P> <P> While the events of most episodes of season one were self - contained , many developments important to the show as a whole occurred during the season . The recurring nemesis Q was introduced in the pilot , the alien Ferengi had their sentinel showing in `` The Last Outpost '' , the holodeck was introduced , and the romantic backstory between William Riker and Deanna Troi was investigated . `` The Naked Now '' , one of the few episodes that depicted Roddenberry 's fascination ( as seen in the show 's bible ) with sex in the future , became a cast favorite . </P> <P> Later episodes in the season set the stage for serial plots . The episode `` Datalore '' introduced Data 's evil twin brother Lore , who made several more appearances in episodes in subsequent seasons . `` Coming of Age '' dealt with Wesley Crusher 's efforts to get into Starfleet Academy while also hinting at the threat to Starfleet later faced in `` Conspiracy '' . `` Heart of Glory '' explored Worf 's character , Klingon culture , and the uneasy truce between the Federation and the Klingon Empire , three themes that played major roles in later episodes . Tasha Yar left the show in `` Skin of Evil '' , becoming the first regular Star Trek character to die permanently ( although the character was seen again in two later episodes ) in either series or film . The season finale , `` The Neutral Zone '' , established the presence of two of TNG ' most enduring villains : the Romulans , making their first appearance since the Original Series , and , through foreshadowing , the Borg . </P> <P> The premiere became the first television episode to be nominated for a Hugo Award since 1972 . Six of the season 's episodes were each nominated for an Emmy Award. `` 11001001 '' won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series , `` The Big Goodbye '' won for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series , and `` Conspiracy '' won for Outstanding Achievement in Makeup for a Series . `` The Big Goodbye '' also won a Peabody Award , the first syndicated program and only Star Trek episode to do so . </P> <P> The top episodes for Nielsen ratings were `` Encounter at Farpoint '' with 15.7 , and the next highest was `` Justice '' with 12.7 . </P> <P> Debuted 1987 - 1988 </P> <H3> Season two ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( season 2 ) <P> The series underwent significant changes during its second season . Beverly Crusher was replaced as Chief Medical Officer by Katherine Pulaski , played by Diana Muldaur , who had been a guest star in `` Return to Tomorrow '' and `` Is There in Truth No Beauty ? '' , two episodes from the original Star Trek series . The ship 's recreational area , Ten - Forward , and its mysterious bartender / advisor , Guinan , played by Whoopi Goldberg , appeared for the first time . Another change was in the opening theme , wherein at the end is a short fanfare . Owing to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike , the number of episodes produced was cut from 26 to 22 , and the start of the season was delayed . Because of the strike , the opening episode , `` The Child '' , was based on a script originally written for Star Trek : Phase II , while the season finale , `` Shades of Gray '' , was a clip show . </P> <P> Nevertheless , season two as a whole was widely regarded as significantly better than season one . Benefiting from Paramount 's commitment to a multiyear run and free from network interference due to syndication , Roddenberry found writers who could work within his guidelines and create drama from the cast 's interaction with the rest of the universe . The plots became more sophisticated and began to mix drama with comic relief . Its focus on character development received special praise . Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley has stated that his primary goal for the season was to plan and execute season - long story arcs and character arcs . Hurley wrote the acclaimed episode `` Q Who '' , which featured the first on - screen appearance of the Borg , TNG 's most popular villain . Season two focused on developing the character Data , and two highly regarded episodes from the season , `` Elementary , Dear Data '' and `` The Measure of a Man '' , featured him prominently . Miles O'Brien also became a more prominent character during the second season , while Geordi La Forge took the position of Chief Engineer . Klingon issues continued to be explored in well - regarded episodes such as `` A Matter of Honor '' and `` The Emissary '' , which introduced Worf 's former lover K'Ehleyr . Five second - season episodes were nominated for six Emmy Awards , and `` Q Who '' won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series . </P> <P> Debuted 1988 - 1989 </P> <H3> Season three ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( season 3 ) <P> Before the production of the third season in the summer of 1989 , some personnel changes were made . Head writer Maurice Hurley was let go and Michael Piller took over for the rest of the series . Creator and executive producer Gene Roddenberry took less of an active role due to his declining health . Roddenberry gave Piller and Berman the executive producer jobs , and they remained in that position for the rest of the series ' run , with Berman overseeing the production as a whole and Piller being in charge of the creative direction of the show and the writing room . Doctor Crusher returned from her off - screen tenure at Starfleet Medical to replace Doctor Pulaski , who had remained a guest star throughout the second season . An additional change was the inclusion of the fanfare that was added to the opening credits of the second season , to the end of the closing credits . Ronald D. Moore joined the show after submitting a spec script that became `` The Bonding '' . He became the franchise 's `` Klingon guru '' , meaning that he wrote most TNG episodes dealing with the Klingon Empire ( though he wrote some Romulan stories , as well , such as `` The Defector '' ) . Writer / producer Ira Steven Behr also joined the show in its third season . Though his tenure with TNG lasted only one year , he later went on to be a writer and showrunner of spin - off series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Six third - season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys . `` Yesterday 's Enterprise '' won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and `` Sins of the Father '' won for Best Art Direction for a Series . After a chiropractor warned that the cast members risked permanent skeletal injury , new two - piece wool uniforms replaced the first two seasons ' extremely tight spandex uniforms . The season finale , the critically acclaimed episode `` The Best of Both Worlds '' , was the first season - ending cliffhanger , a tradition that continued throughout the remainder of the series . </P> <P> Debuted 1989 - 1990 </P> <H3> Season four ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( season 4 ) <P> Brannon Braga and Jeri Taylor joined the show in its fourth season . The fourth season surpassed the Original Series in series length with the production of `` The Best of Both Worlds , Part II '' . A new alien race , the Cardassians , made their first appearance in `` The Wounded '' . They later were featured in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . The season finale , `` Redemption '' , was the 100th episode , and the cast and crew ( including creator Gene Roddenberry ) celebrated the historic milestone on the bridge set .

Between 1994 and 2002 the main Cast of the show went on to star in Generations , First Contact , Insurrection , and Nemesis . Meanwhile , on TV , DS9 continued with some of the prior TNG cast including Worf and O'Brien , and later in Fall of 1994 Frakes ( TNG 's Riker ) guest starred on Deep Space Nine 's `` Defiant '' ( S3E9 ) . In January 1995 the new Star Trek TV series Voyager show launched . and the aforementioned Generations movie had hit theaters in November 1994 . Even with the loss of the franchise 's guide and visionary , Roddenberry , Star Trek : The Next Generation had launched a golden era of new Trek media which would last well into the 21st century . In the finale of Enterprise , over ten years later Frakes and Sirtis reprising their roles as Riker and Deanna appear on television one last time . In the 2010s a project would be undertaken to convert all of TNG to 1080p High - Definition , and by 2015 it was all released on Blue - Ray , TV , and HD internet steaming services . </P> <P> Debuted 1993 - 1994 </P> <H3> Legacy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although the cast members were contracted for eight seasons , Paramount ended The Next Generation after seven , which disappointed and puzzled some of the actors , and was an unusual decision for a successful television show . Paramount then made films using the cast , which it believed would be less successful if the show were still on television . Season eight also would likely have reduced the show 's profitability due to higher cast salaries and a lower price per episode when sold for stripping . The show 's strong ratings continued to the end ; the series finale was ranked number two among all shows that week , between hits Home Improvement and Seinfeld . </P> <P> Star Trek : The Next Generation finale in Season Seven was watched by over 30 million viewers when it concluded in early 1994 . TNG would provide the high - water mark in terms of viewership , with a peak of 11.5 million during its 5th Season prior to the launch of DS9 , and between 1988 and 1992 it picked up half a million to a million additional viewers per year . </P> <P> Adjusted Nielson Ratings for Star Trek TV </P> <Ul> <Li> Fall 1987 - Spring 1988 : 8.55 Million TNG S1 </Li> <Li> Fall 1988 - Spring 1989 : 9.14 Million TNG S2 </Li> <Li> Fall 1989 - Spring 1990 : 9.77 Million TNG S3 </Li> <Li> Fall 1990 - Spring 1991 : 10.58 Million TNG S4 </Li> <Li> Fall 1991 - Spring 1992 : 11.50 Million TNG S5 </Li> <Li> Fall 1992 - Spring 1993 : 10.83 Million TNG S6 ( DS9 S1 Debuted in Spring 1993 ) </Li> <Li> Fall 1993 - Spring 1994 : 9.78 Million TNG S7 + DS9 S2 </Li> <Li> Fall 1994 - Spring 1995 : 7.05 Million DS9 S3 + VOY S1 </Li> <Li> Fall 1995 - Spring 1996 : 6.42 Million DS9 S4 + VOY S2 </Li> <Li> Fall 1996 - Spring 1997 : 5.03 Million DS9 S5 + VOY S3 </Li> <Li> Fall 1997 - Spring 1998 : 4.53 Million DS9 S6+ VOY S4 </Li> <Li> Fall 1998 - Spring 1999 : 4.00 Million DS9 S7 + VOY S5 ( Voyager also had two more seasons ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> High - definition project ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the 2010s , Star Trek : The Next Generation was re-produced in high - definition ( 1080p ) with a format of 4 : 3 ( 1.33 : 1 ) . Many thought would not be possible , but CBS managed to do it and major work was done at CBS Digital . TNG was shot on 35 mm film , which meant the film could be re-scanned to a higher resolution , however , many of the special effects had to be re-produced . Also a 7.1 DTS - HD Master Audio sound option was created . </P> <P> Season 1 achieved 95,000 units in its launch week in 2012 . ( further information Blu - Ray releases ) In addition to the Blu - Ray packages , the HD was sold to many online streaming TV providers such as Netflix . The Netflix version included some additional special effect changes . The Blu - ray sets include many special features and videos , such as a 1988 episode of Reading Rainbow where Levar Burton ( on TNG he is cast as Chief Engineer Geordi ) documents the making of a Star Trek : The Next Generation episode . </P> <P> In June 2016 a 41 - disc set was released with over 8000 minutes of TNG - content , including the entire show in 1080p ( 4 : 3 ) . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Star Trek : The Next Generation cast members Patrick Stewart plays Captain Picard Jonathan Frakes plays First Officer Will Riker Whoopi Goldberg portrays Guinan <Ul> <Li> Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean - Luc Picard is the commanding officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise . Stewart also played the character in the pilot episode of Deep Space Nine and all four TNG theater films </Li> <Li> Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker is the ship 's first officer . The Riker character was influenced by concepts for first officer Willard Decker in the Star Trek : Phase II television series . Decker 's romantic history with helmsman Ilia was mirrored in The Next Generation in the relationship between Riker and Deanna Troi . Riker also appears in an episode each of Star Trek : Voyager and Star Trek : Enterprise . In addition to William Riker , Frakes played William 's transporter - created double , Thomas , in one episode each of The Next Generation and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . </Li> <Li> LeVar Burton as Geordi La Forge was initially the ship 's helmsman , but the character became chief engineer beginning in the second season . Burton also played the character in an episode of Voyager . </Li> <Li> Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar is the chief of security and tactical officer . Crosby left the series at the end of the first season , and the Yar character was killed . Yar returns in alternate timelines in the award - winning episode `` Yesterday 's Enterprise '' and the series finale , `` All Good Things ... '' . Crosby also played Commander Sela , Yar 's half - Romulan daughter . </Li> <Li> Michael Dorn as Worf is a Klingon . Worf initially appears as a junior officer fulfilling several roles on the bridge . When Denise Crosby left at the end of the first season , the Worf character succeeded Lieutenant Yar as the ship 's chief of security and tactical officer . Dorn reprised the role as a regular in seasons four through seven of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and also played another Klingon , also named Worf , in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country ; with 282 on screen appearances , Dorn has the most appearances of any actor in the Star Trek franchise . </Li> <Li> Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher is the Enterprise 's chief medical officer . As a fully certified bridge officer , Dr. Crusher had the ability to command the Enterprise , if circumstances required her to do so . She also , on occasional , commanded night - watch shifts on the ship 's main bridge to stay on top of starship operations . McFadden was fired after the first season , but was rehired for the third season and remained for the remainder of the series . </Li> <Li> Diana Muldaur as Doctor Katherine Pulaski was created to replace Dr. Crusher for the show 's second season . Muldaur , who previously appeared in two episodes of the original Star Trek , never received billing in the opening credits ; instead , she was listed as a special guest star during the first act . </Li> <Li> Marina Sirtis as Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi is the half - human , half - Betazoid ship 's counselor . Starting in the season - seven7 episode `` Thine Own Self '' , Counselor Troi , having taken and completed the bridge - officer 's test , is later promoted to the rank of commander , which allowed her to take command of the ship , and also perform bridge duties other than those of a ship 's counselor . The character 's relationship with first officer Riker was a carry - over from character ideas developed for Phase II . Troi also appeared in later episodes of Voyager and in the finale of Enterprise . </Li> <Li> Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data is an android who serves as second officer and operations officer . Data 's `` outsider 's '' perspective on humanity served a similar narrative purpose as Spock 's in the original Star Trek . Spiner also played his `` brother '' , Lore , and his creator , Noonien Soong . In Enterprise , Spiner played Noonien 's ancestor , Arik , and contributed a brief voiceover ( heard over the Enterprise - D 's intercom ) in the Enterprise finale . </Li> <Li> Wil Wheaton as Beverly Crusher 's son Wesley becomes an acting ensign , and later receives a field commission to ensign , before attending Starfleet Academy . After being a regular for the first four seasons , Wheaton appeared sporadically as Wesley Crusher for the remainder of the series . </Li> </Ul> <P> In addition to the series regulars , other recurring characters include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Majel Barrett as Lwaxana Troi is Deanna Troi 's mother and Betazoid ambassador for the United Federation of Planets . She reprised her role in three episodes of Deep Space Nine . Barrett , married to Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry , previously appeared in the original Star Trek . She also voiced the computer in The Next Generation and other spinoffs . </Li> <Li> Brian Bonsall as Alexander Rozhenko is Worf 's son . Jon Paul Steuer played Alexander in the character 's first appearance , and James Sloyan played an older , time - traveling version of Alexander in another episode . Marc Worden played the character for his appearances in Deep Space Nine . </Li> <Li> Rosalind Chao as Keiko O'Brien is Miles O'Brien's wife and a botanist . She also made recurring appearances in Deep Space Nine . </Li> <Li> John de Lancie as Q is an omnipotent antagonist from the Q Continuum . de Lancie continued playing the Q character in both Deep Space Nine and Voyager . </Li> <Li> Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan is the El - Aurian bartender in the ship 's Ten Forward Lounge . </Li> <Li> Michelle Forbes as Ensign Ro Laren is a Bajoran helmsman , who is later promoted to the rank of lieutenant in season seven . That same season , however , she resigns from Starfleet to become a member of a group of renegade federation colonists known as `` the Maquis '' . Forbes ' character was considered for use in Deep Space Nine , although producers eventually developed a new character , Kira Nerys . </Li> <Li> Colm Meaney as Miles O'Brien is an unnamed helmsman in the show 's pilot , and appears several times in other positions during the first season . The character was eventually given a rank of Chief Petty Officer , and developed into the transporter chief . Meaney portrayed O'Brien for seven seasons as a series regular on Deep Space Nine . </Li> <Li> Robert O'Reilly as Gowron is leader of the Klingon High Council . O'Reilly also appeared as Gowron in Deep Space Nine . O'Reilly appeared in an episode of Enterprise as a different character . </Li> <Li> Dwight Schultz as Lieutenant Reginald Barclay is a technician and engineer who also plays a prominent role in the later seasons of Voyager . </Li> <Li> Patti Yasutake as Ensign Alyssa Ogawa is a nurse in Dr. Crusher 's sickbay . </Li> </Ul> <P> There were certain big changes for regular characters , the major one was that Tasha Yar is only in season one , and Wesley left for Starfleet Academy in Season 4 . In Season 2 the doctor is Pulaski not Crusher , but Crusher does come back and remains the ship 's doctor thereafter ( In All Good Things it is revealed she eventually marries Picard and has her own starship command , thus becoming the new Captain Picard , as he retired to tend a vineyard ) . In many cases the characters , or at least the actors , come back to act in some role on the show . There are many reoccurring characters , some of them have actually more appearances in episodes than Tasha .

These could be grouped in different ways , and one way was by the aliens they were interacting with , for example TNG introduced the Borg and the Cardassians . The Klingons and Romulans had been introduced in the original series ( 1966 -- 69 ) ; however , the Klingons were somewhat re-booted with `` turtle - head '' look , although a retcon was given for this in an Enterprise episode . Another way to group them is by a certain character such as Q or Ro Laren or by a technology like the holo - deck , and there were many other alien encounters ( usually funny foreheads , face - paint , or no - body ) . Often the plot for alien encounters involved some eccentric alien nature that caused tensions , revealed at the end </P> <Dl> <Dt> Alien sagas </Dt> </Dl> <P> The Borg : </P> <Ul> <Li> Q Who ( May 8 , 1989 ) - introduces Borg also a Q - show </Li> <Li> The Best of Both Worlds , Part I & Part II ( June 18 , 1990 & September 24 , 1990 ) - Major Borg diptych <Ul> <Li> Family ( October 1 , 1990 ) - Aftermath of BoBW </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> I , Borg ( May 10 , 1992 ) - Introduces Hue </Li> <Li> Descent , Part I & Part II ( June 21 , 1993 & September 20 , 1993 ) - Another Borg diptych </Li> </Ul> <P> Certain episodes go deeper into the Klingon alien saga , which are famous for having an actual Klingon language made for them in the trekiverse . The Klingon stories usually involve Worf , but not all Worf - centric shows are focused on Klingons .

Law . Benefiting in part from many stations ' decision to air each new episode twice in a week , it consistently ranked in the top ten among hour - long dramas , and networks could not prevent affiliates from preempting their shows with The Next Generation or other dramas that imitated its syndication strategy. Star Trek : The Next Generation received 18 Emmy Awards and , in its seventh season , became the first and only syndicated television show to be nominated for the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series . It was nominated for three Hugo Awards and won two . The first - season episode `` The Big Goodbye '' also won the Peabody Award for excellence in television programming . </P> <P> In 1997 , the episode `` The Best of Both Worlds , Part I '' was ranked No. 70 on TV Guide 's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time .

The buyer of the piece was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , owner of the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle . The piece is on display within the Science Fiction Museum . </P> <P> In 2012 , Entertainment Weekly listed the show at No. 7 in the `` 25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years '' , saying , `` The original Star Trek was cult TV before cult TV was even a thing , but its younger , sleeker offspring brought , yes , a new generation into the Trekker fold , and reignited the promise of sci - fi on television . '' Although TNG did develop a cult following , it was noted for its prime - time general audience viewership also . </P> <P> The flute from `` Inner Light '' was valued at only a few hundred to perhaps 1000 USD when it went to auction , but was sold for over 40,000 ; in this case the auctioneers admitted they had underestimated the appeal of the prop . </P> <P> In the days leading up to the auction , Denise Okuda , former Trek scenic artist and video supervisor , as well as co-writer of the auction catalog , said : `` That 's the item people say they really have to have , because it 's so iconic to a much - beloved episode .

For example , in Star Trek : Armada voice actors from The Next Generation contributed to their characters in the game including Patrick Stewart reprised the roles of Jean - Luc Picard and Locutus , Michael Dorn voiced Worf , Denise Crosby reprised Sela , and J.G. Hertzler voiced Chancellor Martok . Several other voice actors who had been previously unaffiliated with Star Trek also voiced characters in the game , among them was Richard Penn . </P> <P> Star Trek : Armada II was set in the Star Trek : The Next Generation era of the Star Trek universe . </P> <P> Star Trek : Hidden Evil , which came out in 1999 not only included voice acting by Brent Spiner as Data and Patrick Stewart as Picard , but the story was a follow - on from the ninth Star Trek movie , Star Trek : Insurrection . </P> <H2> Films ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Star Trek ( film series ) Levar Burton stars as Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge in all four TNG movies between 1994 and 2002 Michael Dorn also had a scene as Worf in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country . The Worf character would also continue for another 4 seasons on the DS9 spin - off TV show and was in all four TNG films <P> Four films feature the characters of the series : Star Trek Generations ( 1994 ) , Star Trek : First Contact ( 1996 ) , Star Trek : Insurrection ( 1998 ) , and Star Trek : Nemesis ( 2002 ) . </P> <P> Worf played by Dorn also appeared in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country . </P> <P> ` ` I think it was kind of an honor they had my character be sort of the link between the two series . It was wonderful to be working with the other cast ( from the original Star Trek series ) . It was kind of a fantasy because who would have thought when I was watching the original show that I ` d be working in the movie ?

The entire series was gradually released on VHS over the next few years during the remainder of the show 's run and after the show had ended . </P> <P> The VHS for TNG were available on mail - order usually two episodes per VHS cassette . </P> <H3> LaserDisc ( edit ) </H3> <P> Paramount published all episodes on the LaserDisc format from October 1991 using an extended release schedule that concluded in May 1999 . Each disc featured two episodes with Closed Captions , Digital Audio , and CX encoding . Also published were four themed `` collections '' , or boxed sets , of related episodes . These included The Borg Collective , The Q Continuum , Worf : Return to Grace , and The Captains Collection . </P> <P> There was a production error with episode 166 , `` Sub Rosa '' , where a faulty master tape was used that was missing 41⁄2 minutes of footage . Though a new master copy of the episode was obtained , no corrected pressing of this disc was issued . </P> <P> Star Trek : The Next Generation was also released on LaserDisc in the non-US markets Japan and Europe . In Japan , all episodes were released in a series of 14 boxed sets ( two boxed sets per season ) , and as with the US releases were in the NTSC format and ordered by production code . The European laserdiscs were released in the PAL format and included the ten two - part telemovies as well as a disc featuring the episodes Yesterday 's Enterprise and Cause And Effect . The pilot episode , Encounter At Farpoint , was also included in a boxed set called Star Trek : The Pilots featuring the pilot episodes from Star Trek : The Original Series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , and Star Trek : Voyager . </P> <H3> DVD ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first season of the series was released on DVD in March 2002 . Throughout the year the next six seasons were released at various times on DVD , with the seventh season being released in December 2002 . To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series , CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment released Star Trek : The Next Generation -- The Complete Series on October 2 , 2007 . The DVD box set contains 49 discs . Between March 2006 and September 2008 , `` Fan Collective '' editions were released containing select episodes of The Next Generation ( and The Original Series , Deep Space Nine , and Voyager ) based on various themes . The individual episodes were chosen by fans voting on StarTrek.com . In total , six `` Fan Collectives '' were produced , along with a boxed set containing the first five collectives . In April 2013 all seven seasons of Star Trek : The Next Generation were re-released in new packaging featuring a silhouette of a different cast member on each box . However , the discs contained the identical content that was previously released in 2002 . </P> <H3> Blu - Ray ( edit ) </H3> <P> The original show was shot on high - quality 35 mm film , but had to be downscaled before editing and postprocessing to standard ' 80s and ' 90s TV resolution ( video quality ) for broadcast . The show 's final visual effects ( e.g. all exterior shots of the starship Enterprise , phaser fire or beaming fade - ins and - outs ) were also composed only in standard resolution video . All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version . To include such footage on Blu - ray , using only upscaling , would have resulted in a larger but blurred image , so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high definition . They also opted to adhere to the show 's original 4 : 3 aspect ratio . </P> <P> A news release on the official website announced on September 28 , 2011 , in celebration of the series ' twenty - fifth anniversary , that Star Trek : The Next Generation would be completely re-mastered in 1080p and 4k high definition from the original 35 mm film negatives ( consisting of almost 25,000 reels of original film stock ) . All the visual effects for each episode would be digitally recomposed from original large - format negatives and newly created CGI shots . The release would be accompanied by 7.1 DTS Master Audio . </P> <P> An initial disc featuring the episodes `` Encounter at Farpoint '' , `` Sins of the Father '' , and `` The Inner Light '' was released on January 31 , 2012 under the label `` The Next Level '' . The six - disc first season set was released on July 24 , 2012 . The remaining seasons were released periodically thereafter , culminating in the release of the seventh season on December 2 , 2014 . </P> <P> The entire re-mastered series is available on Blu - ray as individual seasons , and as a 41 - disc box set titled The Full Journey . Eventually , all remastered episodes will also be available for television syndication and digital distribution . Mike Okuda believes this is the largest film restoration project ever attempted . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Season </Th> <Th> Release date </Th> <Th> Special features </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Season One </Td> <Td> July 24 , 2012 </Td> <Td> Documentaries `` Energized !

The extended version includes an extra 13 minutes of footage as well as recreated special effects . It was released as part of the Season 2 collection set . </P> <H2> Spin - offs and the franchise ( edit ) </H2> Re-creation of the TNG starship bridge for Star Trek : The Exhibition <P> Star Trek : The Next Generation spawned a lot of media set in its science - fiction vision , which was primarily the 2370s but set in the same universe as first Star Trek TV shows of the 1960s . This included the aforementioned films , computer games , board games , theme parks etc . In the 2010s there was still discussion about a Captain Worf spin - off , the Bridge officer that debuted on TNG and was also featured in the TNG spin - off show Deep Space Nine , which itself had quite a following . </P> <P> Star Trek TNG - era Novels ( examples ) : </P> <Ul> <Li> Balance of Power ( Star Trek ) </Li> <Li> The Children of Hamlin </Li> <Li> Dark Mirror ( Star Trek novel ) </Li> <Li> Death in Winter </Li> <Li> The Devil 's Heart </Li> <Li> I , Q </Li> <Li> Immortal Coil </Li> <Li> Imzadi </Li> <Li> The Peacekeepers </Li> <Li> Planet X ( Star Trek ) </Li> <Li> Star Trek : The Q Continuum </Li> <Li> Q - in - Law </Li> <Li> Rogue ( Star Trek ) </Li> <Li> Rogue Saucer </Li> <Li> Star Trek : The Lost Era </Li> <Li> Star Trek : Typhon Pact </Li> <Li> Star Trek : Stargazer </Li> <Li> Strike Zone </Li> <Li> Survivors ( Star Trek ) </Li> <Li> Star Trek : A Time to ... </Li> <Li> Star Trek : Titan </Li> <Li> Vendetta ( Star Trek ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> These are the voyages ...

'' ( S4E22 ) featured a holodeck simulation on the USS Enterprise ( NCC - 1701 - D ) from Star Trek : The Next Generation during the events of the episode `` The Pegasus '' and the return of Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) and Counselor Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis ) . It was written by Berman and Braga , who noted `` ... this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it '' . </P> <P> Star Trek : Enterprise was TV show launched following Star Trek : Voyager conclusion , and was set 100 years before TOS and 200 years before TNG , in addition to including some soft re-boot elements with an all new cast . Some episodes connected to TNG directly including guest stars by Brent Spiner and connections to the events in TNG 's fictional universe . The three - episode story arc consisting of `` Borderland '' , `` Cold Station 12 '' , and `` The Augments '' , with a Soong ancestor portrayed by The Next Generation regular Brent Spiner provides some backstory to Data 's back - story . Also Affliction ( Star Trek : Enterprise ) also helps explain the smooth - headed Klingons that sometimes appeared , a theatrically presented retcon and backstory that helped explain this varying presentation between TOS , TNG , and Films </P> <P> Star Trek would not return to television as a show for over 12 years , until the debut of Star Trek : Discovery on CBS , but thereafter exclusively available on the internet service CBS All Access ( Neflix Internationally ) at that time .

The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his 1979 play of the same name . The film stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda ( in his final acting performance ) in the lead roles alongwith Jane Fonda , Doug McKeon , Dabney Coleman and William Lanteau appearing in supporting roles . The film 's narrative revolves around an aged couple , cantankerous retiree Norman Thayer and his conciliatory wife , Ethel who spend summers at their New England vacation home on the shores of idyllic Golden Pond . This year , their adult daughter , Chelsea , visits with her new fiancée and his teenage son , Billy on their way to Europe . After leaving Billy behind to bond with Norman , Chelsea returns , attempting to repair the long - strained relationship with her aging father before it 's too late . </P> <P> On Golden Pond was released theatrically on December 4 , 1981 and grossed $119.3 million worldwide becoming the second highest grossing film of 1981 . The film received critical acclaim for Rydell 's direction , Thompson 's screenplay and Hepburn and Fonda 's performances . </P> <P> The film received ten nominations at the 54th Academy Awards including Best Picture and won three : Best Actor ( Fonda ) , Best Actress ( Hepburn ) and Best Adapted Screenplay ( Thompson ) . Henry Fonda won his only competitive Oscar with this movie and at the age of 76 , he became the oldest winner in the aforementioned category . Katharine Hepburn won her fourth Best Actress award , extending her own record for the most Oscars won by a thespian . On Golden Pond is also one of the few movies to earn the nominations for five major Academy Awards ( Best Picture , Director , Actor , Actress , and Screenplay ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Box office </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical Reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Accolades </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> An aging couple , Ethel and Norman Thayer , continue the long tradition of spending each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond , in the far reaches of northern New England . When they first arrive , Ethel notices the loons calling on the lake `` welcoming them home '' . As they resettle into their summer home , Norman 's memory problems arise when he is unable to recognize several family photographs , which he copes with by frequently talking about death and growing old . They are visited by their only child , a daughter , Chelsea , who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father . She introduces her parents to her fiance Bill and his thirteen - year - old son Billy . Norman tries to play mind games with Bill , an apparent pastime of his , but Bill wo n't hear of it , saying he can only take so much . In another conversation , Chelsea discusses with Ethel her frustration over her relationship with her overbearing father , feeling that even though she lives thousands of miles away in Los Angeles , she still feels like she 's answering to him . Before they depart for a European vacation , Chelsea and Bill ask the Thayers to permit Billy to stay with them while they have some time to themselves . Norman , seeming more senile and cynical than usual due to his 80th birthday and heart palpitations , agrees to Billy 's staying . Ethel tells him that he 's the sweetest man in the world , but she is the only one who knows it . </P> <P> Billy is at first annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do . He resents Norman 's brusque manner , but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together . Billy and Norman soon grow obsessed with catching Norman 's fish rival , named `` Walter '' , which leads to the accidental destruction of the Thayers ' motorboat . Chelsea returns to find out her father has made good friends with her fiance 's , now husband 's , son . But when she sees the change in her father 's demeanor , Chelsea attempts something Billy accomplished that she never could : a backflip . Chelsea successfully executes the dive in front of a cheering Norman , Billy , and Ethel . Chelsea and Norman finally fully embrace before she departs with Billy back home . </P> <P> The final day on Golden Pond comes and the Thayers are loading the last of the boxes . Norman tries to move a heavy box , but starts having heart pain and collapses onto the floor of the porch . Ethel tries unsuccessfully to get the operator to phone the hospital . Norman then says the pain is gone and attempts to stand to say a final farewell to the lake . Ethel tells him she has always known about death but for the first time it felt real , thinking Norman was going to die on the spot . Ethel helps Norman to the edge of the lake where they see the loons and Norman notes how they are just like him and Ethel , that their offspring is grown and gone off on her own , and now it is just the two of them . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Katharine Hepburn -- Ethel Thayer </Li> <Li> Henry Fonda -- Norman Thayer Jr . </Li> <Li> Jane Fonda -- Chelsea Thayer Wayne </Li> <Li> Doug McKeon -- Billy Ray </Li> <Li> Dabney Coleman -- Bill Ray </Li> <Li> William Lanteau -- Charlie Martin </Li> <Li> Christopher Rydell -- Sumner Todd </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The father - daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real - life relationship between the two Fondas . </P> <P> Screenwriter Thompson spent his summers along the shores of Great Pond , located in Belgrade , Maine , but the film was made on Squam Lake in Holderness , New Hampshire . The house used in the film was leased from a New York physician and was modified significantly for the shoot : an entire second floor was added as a balcony over the main living area at the request of the production designer . After the shoot , the production company was contractually obligated to return the house to its original state but the owner liked the renovations so much that he elected to keep the house that way and asked the crew not to dismantle the second story . A gazebo and a small boathouse were also relocated during the shoot . </P> <P> Despite their many common acquaintances and long careers in show business , Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn not only had never worked together , but had never met until working on the film . On the first day of shooting , Hepburn presented Henry Fonda with her longtime companion Spencer Tracy 's `` lucky '' hat , which Fonda wore in the film . Hepburn , who was 74 at the time of filming , performed all her own stunts , including a dive into the pond . The scene in which Norman and step - grandson Billy run their boat into the rocks was filmed repeatedly . The vintage 1951 mahogany Chris - Craft boat , used strictly for the crash scene , was so sturdy that it kept bouncing off the rocks without any damage . The crew had to modify the boat so it would break away in the wreck . The water level in Squam Lake was so low during the summer of production that Fonda and Doug McKeon could have stood during the scene in which they were supposedly clinging to the rocks for fear of drowning . The September water was barely knee - deep , but it was cold enough that the pair had to wear wetsuits under their clothes . Hepburn , on the other hand , dove into the water without the aid of the wetsuit because she wanted the scene to keep its authenticity . Some of the scenes in which Billy takes the boat out on his own were filmed on nearby Lake Winnipesaukee . While filming the scene where Fonda and Hepburn were watching the loons on the lake , the speedboat that zoomed by and disturbed them was so forceful it overturned their canoe in one take ; Fonda was immediately taken out of the water and wrapped up in blankets as his health was fragile by that time . The speedboat was piloted by the screenwriter , Ernest Thompson . </P> <P> When visiting Holderness , New Hampshire , one can take a boat tour of Squam Lake and view the filming sites from the movie . There is also a restaurant called `` Walter 's Basin '' , which is named after the trout called `` Walter '' that Billy catches with Norman . For filming , `` Walter '' was brought in from a trout pond at the nearby Castle in the Clouds estate . He was released after his capture back into Squam Lake . Leftover footage of Fonda and Hepburn driving through the New Hampshire countryside , as seen in the opening credits , was later used for the opening of the CBS television sitcom Newhart . </P> <P> The studio behind the film was ITC Entertainment , the British company presided over ( until late 1981 ) by Lord Grade , the television and film mogul . It was Grade who largely raised the financing for the film . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> With a box office take of $119,285,432 , On Golden Pond was the second - highest grossing film of the year , following Raiders of the Lost Ark , which earned $209,562,121 . </P> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> Henry Fonda received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Norman Thayer , marking his only competitive Oscar win and at 76 became the oldest winner in the category <P> On Golden Pond garnered widespread critical acclaim with critics highlighting the performances of Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda . The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92 % based on 386 reviews , with an average rating of 8.7 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` There 's little that happens in On Golden Pond that is n't thoroughly predictable from the start , but the film is blessed with so much star power , charm and honest sentiment that everyone in the audience is willing to ignore the cliches and go the distance . '' Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times said `` On Golden Pond was a treasure for many reasons , but the best one , I think , is that I could believe it . I could believe in its major characters and their relationships , and in the things they felt for one another , and there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and change . I left the theater feeling good and warm , and with a certain resolve to try to mend my own relationships and learn to start listening better ... watching the movie , I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable . '' </P> Katharine Hepburn received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Ethel Thayer , marking her fourth win in the category , making her the most awarded thespian in the history of the Academy Awards <P> In his The New York Times review , Vincent Canby said , `` As a successful Broadway play , On Golden Pond was processed American cheese , smooth , infinitely spreadable and bland , with color added by the actors ... the movie ... still American cheese , but its stars -- Henry Fonda , Katharine Hepburn , Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman -- add more than color to this pasteurized product . On Golden Pond now has the bite of a good old cheddar ... Mr. Fonda gives one of the great performances of his long , truly distinguished career . Here is film acting of the highest order ... Miss Hepburn ... is also in fine form . One of the most appealing things about her as an actress is the way she responds to -- and is invigorated by -- a strong co-star ... she needs someone to support , challenge and interact with . Mr. Fonda is the best thing that 's happened to her since Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart ... an added pleasure is the opportunity to see Dabney Coleman ( in ) a role that goes beyond the caricatures he 's usually given to play ... On Golden Pond is a mixed blessing , but it offers one performance of rare quality and three others that are very good . That 's not half - bad . '' </P> <P> TV Guide rates it 3 1⁄2 out of a possible four stars , calling it `` a beautifully photographed movie filled with poignancy , humor , and ( of course ) superb acting ... there could have been no finer final curtain for ( Henry Fonda ) than this . '' Channel 4 sums up its review by stating , `` Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn both shine in an impressively executed Hollywood drama . ( It ) has its mawkish moments but there 's a certain pleasure in that , and writer Thompson 's analysis of old age is sensitive , thought - provoking and credible . '' </P> <P> Not all reviewers were impressed , however . David Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film `` the cinematic equivalent of shrink - wrapping , in which all of the ideas , feelings , characters , and images are neatly separated and hermetically sealed to prevent spoilage , abrasion , or any contact with the natural world ... Mark Rydell 's bright , banal visual style further sterilizes the issues . The film exudes complacency and self - congratulation ; it is a very cowardly , craven piece of ersatz art . '' Time Out London says , `` Two of Hollywood 's best - loved veterans deserved a far better swan song than this sticky confection . '' Mad magazine satirized the film as On Olden Pond . </P> <P> American Film Institute recognition </P> <Ul> <Li> AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies -- Nominated </Li> <Li> AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Passions -- No. 22 </Li> <Li> AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes : <Ul> <Li> `` Listen to me , mister .

Out of the over 160 acts that passed through the preliminary auditions , 48 went on to perform in the live shows . This season , the callbacks were renamed `` The Vegas Verdicts '' . Unlike previous seasons , the acts were not given a chance to perform a second time , unless prompted by the judges to as a challenge . The judges re-watched audition tapes and created a Top 40 based on the acts ' preliminary performances , similar to the format used on sister show Britain 's Got Talent . However , it was revealed during the first performance show that the judges , when prompted by executive producer Simon Cowell , called back eight acts that they previously had cut . This brought the total number of acts up to 48 . Last season , the acts who passed through were divided into four groups , who performed over the course of two weeks with the acts who passed through from the previous night being announced before the next group of acts ' performances . This year , each group in the Top 48 was divided into four groups of 12 , but only one group performed per week , as a separate results show for the group aired the next day . This season was the first to feature results episodes lasting one hour on a weekly basis since season one . </P> <P> During the performances episodes , if all three judges buzzed an act , the act was forced to end , unlike the previous season , where it could continue on for a short time . In the results episodes , five best acts from each group of twelve proceeded to the semi-finals - four acts were determined solely by viewers ' votes , the judges decided between acts with the fifth and sixth highest viewers ' vote totals . The twelve acts were presented to the audience in groups of two or three ( usually similar acts - e.g. dancers , children - are put together ) and then the host announced which of them moved forward and which of them had been eliminated . When three acts are presented as a group , the host would first announce an act from the three as the first act eliminated , then would announce which act from the remaining two remained in the competition . The final group were acts in the fifth and sixth places and the judges pick one of them by majority voting . At no time was the audience made aware of how many viewers ' votes each act received . </P> <P> In the semifinals , the twenty acts who passed through the quarterfinals were divided into groups of 10 . One of these groups performed each week , with a performance episode followed by the results the following day . Only four acts were supposed to pass through to the finals each week . Three are determined solely by viewers ' votes , but the fourth and fifth place acts must face the judges ' decision . However , in one case , the judges passed through both performers , as they could not make a decision . In the other case , the top five acts were passed through . Instead of previous seasons , where the finals contain four or five acts , this season the finale contained ten acts . </P> <H2> Preliminary auditions ( edit ) </H2> <P> This year , auditions were held in New York City , Houston , Los Angeles , Chicago , Miami , and Seattle / Tacoma . Auditions were also held in Boston , Atlanta , and Washington , D.C. but not televised . A total of 160 acts advanced to the Las Vegas Round . </P> <H2> Second round ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Vegas Verdicts ( edit ) </H3> <P> Vegas Verdicts aired on July 28 , 2009 and July 29 , 2009 . Over the course of the two episodes , the over 160 acts that made it through the preliminary rounds were narrowed down to a Top 40 that made it through to the live performance rounds . </P> <P> In the first episode of the `` Vegas Verdicts '' , as Cannon referred to it , the episode started off with 25 of the 160 acts being eliminated right at the Las Vegas Airport . The remaining acts were then briefly shown enjoying the sights of Vegas , before the eliminations resumed . Acts were brought before the judges and informed of their fate . The judges selected three dance groups : Destined 2 Be , BreakSk8 , and U4ria Dance Crew for a challenge . They were asked to prepare a dance routine for 12 hours plus they 'll have the same piece of music . After they perform , the judges will decide which dance groups will advance to the Top 40 Quarterfinals . </P> <P> In the second episode , the remainder of the Top 40 was revealed , and many more acts were eliminated . The three dance crews challenged in the previous episode were shown in a montage performing their challenge performance . </P> <P> At the end of the second episode , Simon Cowell , executive producer of the show , called the judges on their flight back to Los Angeles , stating that he was unhappy with some of the eliminations the judges made . Cowell revealed that there was just `` too much talent '' eliminated , and that he felt that a number of these acts should be given another chance . As a result , two acts were brought back as wildcards during each quarterfinal round . </P> First cut ( edit ) <P> Acts that were eliminated at the Las Vegas Airport include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Circus R Us <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Contortion , hula hoops on unicycles </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Tallan Noble Latz <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : 9 - year - old electric guitarist </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Nathan Burton <Ul> <Li> Preliminaries , Episode 7 `` : Magician , he also appeared in season one </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Kari Callin <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Singer , sang `` Somewhere '' from West Side Story </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Ciana Pelekai <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 10 '' : 8 - year - old singer , sang `` At Last '' . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alex Wesley <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 10 '' : 53 - year - old dancer . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Part one cuts ( edit ) <P> Acts that were cut in the first episode of the Vegas Verdict included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Keith Johnson <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Singer and guitarist , performed `` Walking in Memphis '' by Marc Cohn . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Tony Ferrante <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : 74 - year - old dancer , performed to `` You Make Me Feel ( Mighty Real ) '' by Sylvester James . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Joseph Constantine <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Magician </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Spiritual Harmonizers <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : Close harmony singing group of Post Office workers . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Fuchsia FoXXX <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Belly dancer </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Hurricane Tricksters <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Trickers </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Part two cuts ( edit ) <P> Acts that were cut in the second episode of the Vegas Verdict included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Rashida Jolley <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Performed and sang `` Killing Me Softly '' on the harp . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Christopher & Laura Camp <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Whip act </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Duo Design <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Hand balancers . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Flash <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Jugglers and acrobats . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Kalinins <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Father and son acrobats . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Arthur Gulkarov <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : Contortionist and dancer </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Kara & Corey Britz <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Sibling guitarist / singer duo , performed `` Every Breath You Take '' by The Police . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Serenades <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Singers .

Twelve acts ( ten of the original Top 40 , plus two wildcards ) performed each week . A two - hour performance episode each Tuesday was followed by a one - hour results show the following day , where five of the twelve acts from the previous night remained in the competition . When an act got buzzed by all three judges , they must stop , unlike in the previous seasons , where at this stage acts were allowed to continue despite being buzzed by all judges . A large X appeared on the screen on stage , indicating the act had been struck out by the judges . Viewers were still able to vote for the buzzed act .

The Prime Minister is vested with the responsibility of running the administration through his appointed federal cabinet , formulating national policies to ensure the safeguard of the interests of the nation and its people through the Council of Common Interests as well as making the decision to call nationwide general elections for the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan . </P> <P> Since 1947 , Pakistan has had eighteen prime ministers , aside from the appointed caretaker prime ministers who were only mandated to oversee the system until the election process was finished . In Pakistan 's parliamentary system , the Prime Minister is sworn - in by the President and usually is the Chairman or / the President of the party or coalition that has a majority in the National Assembly -- the lower house of Pakistan Parliament . </P> <P> After the Partition of India on the midnight of 14 / 15 August 1947 , Pakistan followed the British system by creating the post of Prime Minister based at the Prime Minister 's Secretariat . The then Governor - General of Pakistan , Muhammad Ali Jinnah , took advice from the Founding Fathers of the nation and appointed Liaquat Ali Khan to establish and lead his administration on 15 August 1947 . Before the presidential system in 1960 , seven prime ministers had served between 1947 until martial law in 1958 . In 1971 , the office was again revived but ceased to exist shortly . Executive powers and authority was given to the Prime Minister when the full set of the Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated in 1973 but the post was ceased from its effective operations after another martial law in 1977 . After the general elections held in 1985 , the office came to its existence . Between 1988 -- 99 , the office was held by Benazir Bhutto of the PPP and Nawaz Sharif of PML ( N ) , each holding the office for two non-consecutive terms between 1988 and 1999 : Bhutto during 1988 -- 90 and 1993 -- 96 ; and Sharif during 1990 -- 93 and 1997 -- 99 . </P> <P> The premiership of I.I. Chundrigar was the shortest in Pakistan 's history , serving only 55 days of his term . At approximately five years and four months in total , Sharif is the longest - serving Prime Minister . Sharif was re-elected for a third non-consecutive term on 5 June 2013 , which is a record in the history of Pakistan . The national politics in Pakistan was mostly dominated by the army department of the Pakistan Armed Forces throughout its history , but it is now dominated by the political parties . </P> <P> After the general elections held in 2002 , Zafarullah Khan Jamali was invited to form his administration as its Prime Minister .

However Benazir Bhutto 's two non-consecutive terms ( 1988 - 1990 and 1993 - 1996 ) and Nawaz Sharif 's three non-consecutive terms ( 1990 - 1993 , 1997 - 1999 and 2013 - 2017 ) are usually counted separately . As a result some sources count Khan as 19th Prime Minister , but most count him as 22nd . This counting system does not treat Nawaz Sharif 's two periods in office in 1993 ( separated by Balakh Sher Mazari 's brief stint as caretaker ) as separate terms . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Article 153 ( 2a ) - 153 ( 2c ) in Chapter 3 : Special Provisions , Part V : Relations between Federation and Provinces in the Constitution of Pakistan . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Prime minister '' .

Known as the `` Father of Texas '' , and the founder of Texas , he led the second , and ultimately , the successful colonization of the region by bringing 300 families from the United States to the region in 1825 . </P> <P> Born in Virginia and raised in southeastern Missouri , Austin served in the Missouri territorial legislature before moving to Arkansas Territory and later Louisiana . His father , Moses Austin , received an empresario grant from Spain to settle Texas . After Moses Austin 's death in 1821 , Stephen Austin won recognition of the empresario grant from the newly - independent state of Mexico . Austin convinced numerous American settlers to move to Texas , and by 1825 Austin had brought the first 300 American families into the territory . Throughout the 1820s , Austin sought to maintain good relations with the Mexican government , and he helped suppress the Fredonian Rebellion . He also helped ensure the introduction of slavery into Texas despite the attempts of the Mexican government to ban the institution . </P> <P> As Texas settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with the Mexican government , Austin advocated conciliation with the Mexican government , but the dissent against Mexico escalated into the Texas Revolution . Austin led Texas forces at the successful Siege of Béxar before serving as a commissioner to the United States . Austin ran in the 1836 Texas presidential election but was defeated by Sam Houston . Houston appointed Austin as secretary of state for the new republic , and Austin held that position until his death in December 1836 . </P> <P> Numerous places and institutions are named in his honor , including the capital of Texas , Austin in Travis County , Austin County , Austin Bayou , Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches , Austin College in Sherman , and a number of K - 12 schools . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early years </Li> <Li> 2 Moving to Texas </Li> <Li> 3 Empresario Austin </Li> <Li> 4 Slavery </Li> <Li> 5 Relations with Mexico </Li> <Li> 6 Texas Revolution </Li> <Li> 7 Austin in the Republic of Texas </Li> <Li> 8 Death and estate </Li> <Li> 9 Monuments </Li> <Li> 10 Past family </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 Further reading </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early years </H2> Coat of arms of Stephen F. Austin Memorial to Stephen F. Austin in his birthplace <P> Stephen F. Austin was born in the mining region of southwestern Virginia ( Wythe County ) in what is known as Austinville today , some 256 miles ( 412 km ) southwest of Richmond , Virginia . He was the second child of Mary Brown Austin and Moses Austin ; the first , Eliza , lived only one month . On June 8 , 1798 , when Stephen was four years old , his family moved west to the lead - mining region of present - day Potosi , Missouri , 40 miles west of the Mississippi River . His father Moses Austin received a sitio from the Spanish government for the mining site of Mine à Breton , established by French colonists . His great - great - grandfather , Anthony Austin ( b. 1636 ) , was the son of Richard Austin ( b. 1598 in Bishopstoke , Hampshire , England ) , he and his wife Esther were original settlers of Suffield , Massachusetts , which became Connecticut in 1749 . </P> <P> When Austin was eleven years old , his family sent him back east to be educated , first at the preparatory school of Bacon Academy in Colchester , Connecticut , and then at Transylvania University in Lexington , Kentucky , from which he graduated in 1810 . After graduation , Austin began studying to be a lawyer . At age 21 , he served in the legislature of the Missouri Territory . As a member of the territorial legislature , he was `` influential in obtaining a charter for the struggling Bank of St. Louis . '' </P> <P> Left penniless after the Panic of 1819 , Austin decided to move south to the new Arkansas Territory . He acquired property on the south bank of the Arkansas River , in the area that would later become Little Rock . After purchasing the property , he learned the area was being considered as the location for the new territorial capital , which could make his land worth a great deal more . He made his home in Hempstead County , Arkansas . Two weeks before the first Arkansas territorial elections in 1820 , Austin declared his candidacy for Congress . His late entrance meant his name did not appear on the ballot in two of the five counties , but he still placed second in the field of six candidates . Later , he was appointed as a judge for the First Circuit Court . Over the next few months , Little Rock did become the territorial capital , but Austin 's claim to land in the area was contested , and the courts ruled against him . The Territorial Assembly reorganized the government and abolished Austin 's judgeship . </P> <P> Austin left the territory , moving to Louisiana . He reached New Orleans in November 1820 , where he met and stayed with a New Orleans lawyer and former Kentucky congressman , Joseph H. Hawkins , and made arrangements to study law . </P> <H2> Moving to Texas </H2> Sam Houston and Stephen Austin depicted on the Texas Centennial Issue postage stamp of 1936 <P> During Austin 's time in Arkansas , his father traveled to Spanish Texas and received an empresarial grant that would allow him to bring 300 American families to Texas , they would be called `` The Old 300 . '' Moses Austin caught pneumonia soon after returning to Missouri . He directed that his empresario grant would be taken over by his son Stephen . </P> <P> Although Austin was reluctant to carry on his father 's Texas venture , he was persuaded to pursue the colonization of Texas by a letter from his mother , Mary Brown Austin , written two days before Moses Austin would die . Austin boarded the steamer , Beaver , and departed to New Orleans to meet Spanish officials led by Erasmo Seguín . He was at Natchitoches , Louisiana , on June 31 , 1821 , when he learned of his father 's death . `` This news has effected me very much , he was one of the most feeling and affectionate Fathers that ever lived . His faults I now say , and always have , were not of the heart . '' </P> <P> At the age of 24 , Austin led his party to travel 300 miles ( 480 km ) in four weeks to San Antonio with the intent of reauthorizing his father 's grant , arriving on August 12 . While in transit , they learned Mexico had declared its independence from Spain , and Texas had become a Mexican province , rather than a Spanish territory . José Antonio Navarro , a San Antonio native with ambitious visions of the future of Texas , befriended Stephen F. Austin , and the two developed a lasting association . Navarro , proficient in Spanish and Mexican law , assisted Austin in obtaining his empresario contracts . In San Antonio , the grant was reauthorized by Governor Antonio María Martínez , who allowed Austin to explore the Gulf Coast between San Antonio and the Brazos River to find a suitable location for a colony . As guides for the party , Manuel Becerra and three Aranama Indians , went with the expedition . </P> <P> Austin advertised the Texas opportunity in New Orleans , announcing that land was available along the Brazos and Colorado rivers . A family of a husband , wife , and two children would receive 1,280 acres ( 520 ha ) at twelve and a half cents per acre . Farmers could get 177 acres ( 72 ha ) , and ranchers 4,428 acres ( 1,792 ha ) . In December 1821 , the first U.S. colonists crossed into the granted territory by land and sea , on the Brazos River in present - day Brazoria County , Texas . </P> <H2> Empresario Austin </H2> Stephen F. Austin was an important figure in early Texas <P> Austin 's plan for an American colony was thrown into turmoil by Mexico 's gaining independence from Spain in 1821 . Governor Martínez informed Austin that the junta instituyente , the new rump congress of the government of Agustín de Iturbide of Mexico , refused to recognize the land grant authorized by Spain . His government intended to use a general immigration law to regulate new settlement in Mexico . Austin traveled to Mexico City , where he persuaded the junta instituyente to approve the grant to his father , as well as the law signed by the Mexican Emperor on January 3 , 1823 . </P> <P> The old imperial law offered heads of families a league and a labor of land , 4,605 acres ( 1,864 ha ) , and other inducements . It also provided for the employment of agents , called empresarios , to promote immigration . As an empresario , Austin was to receive 67,000 acres of land for each 200 families he brought to Texas . According to the law , immigrants were not required to pay fees to the government . Some of the immigrants denied Austin 's right to charge them for services at the rate of 12.5 cents / acre ( 31 cents / ha ) . </P> <P> When the Emperor of Mexico , Agustín de Iturbide , abdicated in March 1823 , the law was annulled once again . In April 1823 , Austin induced the congress to grant him a contract to bring 300 families into Texas . He wanted honest , hard - working people who would make the colony a success . In 1824 , the congress passed a new immigration law that allowed the individual states of Mexico to administer public lands and open them to settlement under certain conditions . In March 1825 , the legislature of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas passed a law similar to the one authorized by Iturbide . The law continued the system of empresarios , as well as granting each married man a league of land , 4,428 acres ( 1,792 ha ) , with the stipulation that he must pay the state $30 within six years . </P> <P> By late 1825 , Austin had brought the first 300 families to his settlement , the Austin Colony ; these 300 are now known in Texas history as the Old Three Hundred . Austin had obtained further contracts to settle an additional 900 families between 1825 and 1829 . He had effective civil and military authority over the settlers , but he was quick to introduce a semblance of American law - the Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas was agreed on in November 1827 . Also , Austin organized small , informal armed groups to protect the colonists , which evolved into the Texas Rangers . Despite his hopes , Austin was making little money from his endeavors ; the colonists were unwilling to pay for his services as empresario and most of his revenues were spent on the processes of government and other public services . </P> <P> During these years , Austin , a member of Louisiana Lodge No. 111 at Ste . Genevieve , Missouri , sought to establish Freemasonry in Texas . Freemasonry was well established among the educated classes of Mexican society . It had been introduced among the aristocracy loyal to the House of Bourbon , and the conservatives had total control over the Order . By 1827 , Americans living in Mexico City had introduced the United States York Rite of Freemasonry as a liberal alternative to the established European - style Scottish Rite . </P> <P> On February 11 , 1828 , Austin called a meeting of Freemasons at San Felipe to elect officers and to petition the Masonic Grand Lodge in Mexico City for a charter to form a lodge . Austin was elected Worshipful Master of the new lodge . Although the petition reached Matamoros , and was to be forwarded to Mexico City , nothing more was heard of it . By 1828 , the ruling faction in Mexico was afraid the liberal elements in Texas might try to gain their independence . Fully aware of the political philosophies of American Freemasons , the Mexican government outlawed Freemasonry on October 25 , 1828 . In 1829 , Austin called another meeting , where it was decided that it was `` impolitic and imprudent , at this time , to form Masonic lodges in Texas . '' </P> <P> He was active in promoting trade and currying the good favor of the Mexican authorities , aiding them in the suppression of the Fredonian Rebellion of Haden Edwards . Some historians consider the Fredonian Rebellion to be the beginning of the Texas Revolution . Although `` premature ... the Fredonian Rebellion sparked the powder for later success . '' For this event , Austin raised troops to fight with Mexican troops against the Texas rebels . With the colonists numbering more than 11,000 by 1832 , they were becoming less amenable to Austin 's cautious leadership , and also , the Mexican government was becoming less cooperative . It was concerned with the growth of the colony and the efforts of the U.S. government to buy the state from them . The Mexican government had attempted to stop further U.S. immigration as early as April 1830 , but Austin 's skills gained an exemption for his colonies . He granted land to immigrants based on 640 acres ( 2.6 km ) to the husband , 320 to the wife , 160 for every child , and 80 for every slave . </P> <H2> Slavery </H2> <P> Slavery was a very important issue to Austin , one he called `` of great interest '' to him . Austin was a periodical slaveowner throughout his life ; however , he had conflicting views about it . Theoretically , he believed slavery was wrong and went against the American ideal of liberty . In practice , however , he agreed with the social , economic , and political justifications of it , and worked hard to defend and expand it . Despite his defense of it , he also harbored concerns that the long - term effects of slavery would destroy American society . He grew particularly concerned following Nat Turner 's rebellion , stating : </P> <P> `` I sometimes shudder at the consequences and think that a large part of America will be Santo Domingonized in 100 , or 200 years . The idea of seeing such a country as this overrun by a slave population almost makes me weep . It is in vain to tell a North American that the white population will be destroyed some fifty or eighty years hence by the negroes , and that his daughters will be violated and Butchered by them . '' </P> <P> While Austin thought it would be advantageous some day for Texas to phase out of slavery , up until the Texas Revolution , he worked to ensure that his colony 's immigrants could bypass the Mexican government 's resistance to it . Doing so ensured the population growth and economic development of his colony , which was primarily dependent on the monocropping of cotton and sugar . </P> <P> Arguing that the loss of slaves would be ruinous to the colony , he arranged for his settlers to receive eighty acres of land for each slave they brought with them to Texas . In August 1825 , he recommended that the state government allow immigrants to bring their slaves with them through 1840 , with the caveat that female grandchildren of the slaves would be freed by the age of 15 , and males by age of 25 . His recommendation was rejected . </P> <P> In 1826 , when a state committee proposed abolishing slavery outright , 25 percent of the people in Austin 's colony were slaves . Austin 's colonists , mostly pro-slavery immigrants from the south , threatened to leave Texas if the proposition passed , while prospective Southern immigrants hesitated to come to Texas until slavery was guaranteed there . </P> <P> Austin conceded that the success of his colony was dependent on slavery . Without slaves , the colonists would lack the mass labor to cultivate the land , which would stall the pace of immigration needed to develop and increase the value of the land , which would deflate the economy and motivate his colonists to leave . </P> <P> Austin went before the legislature and pleaded that , at the least ; his original 300 colonists should be allowed to keep their slaves . He argued against the `` bad faith '' of freeing them , demanded reparations to slaveowners for every slave emancipated by the state , warned that the loss of slaves could leave some colonists destitute , and reasoned that freeing them would not only leave his settlers alone in the harsh Texas environment , but would also expose them to the discomfort and nuisance of living amongst freed slaves , who would become vagrants seeking retribution upon their former owners . While he waited for the legislature 's verdict of his request , Austin went into a deep depression over the issue and sent his brother , Brown Austin , to further lobby the legislature on his behalf . </P> <P> In March of 1827 , the legislature signed Article 13 into law . Despite the law complying with some of his requests , Austin called it `` unconstitutional . '' He contested the law as it freed the children of slaves at birth , established a six - month grace period before fully emancipating all slaves in the state , and included provisions to improve the conditions of slaves and transitioning freedmen . Austin -- -- who had been so effective in persuading the legislature , however , that the author of Article 13 ( before its passage ) requested to withdraw it -- -- helped his colonists evade the law by advising them to legally supplant the word `` slave '' with the words `` workingmen , '' `` family servants , '' and `` laborers , '' and by working to pass a decree that banned freedmen from Texas and forced emancipated slaves to work for their former slaveowners until the accrued `` debt '' ( e.g. clothing , food ) , incurred for their own enslavement , was worked off . </P> <P> In 1828 , Austin petitioned the legislature to guarantee that slaveowners , immigrating to Texas , could legally `` free '' their slaves before immigrating , and contract them into a lifetime term of indentured servitude , thereby avoiding recognizing them as slaves . He lobbied to help his colony elude Vicente Guerrero 's 1829 attempt to legally emancipate slaves in the province , and to bypass the government 's effort to prohibit slavery when it passed the Law of April 6 , 1830 . In 1830 , Austin wrote that he would oppose Texas joining the United States without guarantees that he should `` insist on the perpetual exclusion of slavery from this state ( Texas ) . '' In 1833 , he wrote : </P> <P> `` Texas must be a slave country . Circumstances and unavoidable necessity compel it . It is the wish of the people there , and it is my duty to do all I can , prudently , in favor of it . I will do so . '' </P> <P> In May 1835 , Austin 's colonists learned that Mexico 's tolerance for the evasions of slaveowners was drawing to a close , with its proposal of new abolition legislation . Alarmed , and with Austin imprisoned in Mexico for pushing for independence , colonists turned against the Mexican government , calling it `` oppressive '' and a `` plundering , robbing , autocratical government '' without regard for the security of `` life , liberty or property . '' Resisting the impact a changed slavery policy would have on economic growth , and fearing rumors of Mexico 's plan to free the slaves and turn them loose upon the colonists , shortly after Austin returned from Mexico , he and his colonists took up arms against the Mexican government . Austin later gained U.S. Government support for his revolution when he wrote to Senator Lewis F. Linn and pleaded that Santa Anna planned to `` exterminate '' all of the colonists and fill Texas `` with Indians and negroes ( freed slaves ) . '' </P> <H2> Relations with Mexico </H2> Marble sculpture of Stephen F. Austin ( 1903 ) by Elisabet Ney at the Texas State Capitol <P> The application off the immigration control of the introduction of tariff laws had done much to dissatisfy the colonists , peaking in the Anahuac Disturbances . Austin became involved in Mexican politics , supporting the upstart Antonio López de Santa Anna . Following the success of Santa Anna , the colonists sought a compensatory reward , proclaimed at the Convention of 1832 -- resumption of immigration , tariff exemption , separation from Coahuila , and a new state government for Texas . Austin did not support these demands ; he considered them ill - timed and tried his hardest to moderate them . When they were repeated and extended at the Convention of 1833 , Austin traveled to Mexico City on July 18 , 1833 , and met with Vice President Valentín Gomez Farías . Austin did gain certain important reforms ; the immigration ban was lifted , but a separate state government was not authorized . Statehood in Mexico required a population of 80,000 , and Texas had only 30,000 . </P> <P> Believing that he was pushing for Texas independence and suspect that he was trying to incite insurrection , Austin was arrested by the Mexican government in January 1834 in Saltillo , Coahuila , Mexico . He was taken to Mexico City and imprisoned . No charges were filed against him as no court would take jurisdiction . He was moved from prison to prison . He was released under bond in December 1834 and required to stay in the Federal District . He was fully freed under the general amnesty in July 1835 and in August 1835 left Mexico to return to Texas via New Orleans . </P> <H2> Texas Revolution </H2> Main article : Texas Revolution <P> In his absence , a number of events propelled the colonists toward confrontation with Santa Anna 's centralist government . Austin took temporary command of the Texan forces during the Siege of Béxar from October 12 to December 11 , 1835 . After learning of the Disturbances at Anahuac and Velasco in the summer of 1835 , an enraged Santa Anna made rapid preparations for the Mexican army to sweep Anglo settlers from Texas . War began in October 1835 at Gonzales . The Republic of Texas , created by a new constitution on March 2 , 1836 , won independence following a string of defeats with the dramatic turnabout victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21 , 1836 , and the capture of Santa Anna the following morning .

Austin returned to Texas to rest at Peach Point in August . On August 4 , he announced his candidacy for president of Texas . Austin felt confident he could win the election until two weeks before the election , when on August 20 , Houston entered the race . Austin wrote , `` Many of the old settlers who are too blind to see or understand their interest will vote for him . '' Houston carried East Texas , the Red River region , and most of the soldiers ' votes . Austin received 587 votes to Sam Houston 's 5,119 and Henry Smith 's 743 votes . </P> <P> Houston would appoint Austin as the first secretary of state of the new republic ; however , Austin only served approximately two months before his death . </P> <H2> Death and estate </H2> <P> In December 1836 , Austin was in the new capital of Columbia ( now known as West Columbia ) where he caught a severe cold ; his condition worsened . Doctors were called in , but could not help him . Austin died of pneumonia at noon on December 27 , 1836 . He was at the home of George B. McKinstry , near what is now West Columbia , Texas . He was 43 . Austin 's last words were `` The independence of Texas is recognized ! Do n't you see it in the papers ? ... '' Upon hearing of Austin 's death , Houston ordered an official statement proclaiming : `` The Father of Texas is no more ; the first pioneer of the wilderness has departed . '' Originally , Austin was buried at Gulf Prairie Cemetery in Brazoria County , Texas .

It is regularly described as being the pinnacle of rugby league , even in comparison with international competitions . </P> <P> Players are selected to represent the Australian state in which they played their first senior rugby league game , hence the name ' state of origin ' . Prior to 1980 players were only selected for interstate matches on the basis of where they were playing their club football at the time . In both 1980 and 1981 there were two interstate matches under the old selection rules and one experimental `` State of Origin '' match . From 1982 onwards a best - of - three match series has been played around the middle of the rugby league season for the State of Origin shield . During the early years , the results were extraordinarily even . However , since 2006 , Queensland has won every series except in 2014 and 2018 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Teams </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Interstate Rugby League prior to 1980 </Li> <Li> 2.2 Conception of State of Origin football </Li> <Li> 2.3 Experimentation </Li> <Li> 2.4 Adoption </Li> <Li> 2.5 1987 : American controversy </Li> <Li> 2.6 1990s </Li> <Li> 2.7 2000s </Li> <Li> 2.8 2010s </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Venues <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Queensland </Li> <Li> 3.2 New South Wales </Li> <Li> 3.3 Interstate & International </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Popularity </Li> <Li> 5 Broadcasting </Li> <Li> 6 Selection rules <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Controversy </Li> <Li> 6.2 Anomalies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Results <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Year by year </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Wally Lewis Medal </Li> <Li> 9 Records <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Team </Li> <Li> 9.2 Individual <Ul> <Li> 9.2. 1 Playing </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.3 Coaching </Li> <Li> 9.4 Other Records </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Under 20s </Li> <Li> 11 Women 's State of Origin <Ul> <Li> 11.1 All - Team Records </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References <Ul> <Li> 13.1 History </Li> <Li> 13.2 General records and statistics </Li> <Li> 13.3 Sources disputing the 1987 Los Angeles match </Li> <Li> 13.4 Player lists </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 14 Further reading </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Teams ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since the 1908 establishment of rugby league in Australia , the sport 's two major states , New South Wales and Queensland , have played representative matches against each other which have continued into the `` state of origin '' era which began in the 1980s . The two states ' teams are frequently referred to as the Blues and Maroons , reflecting the respective colours of their jerseys . These were the colours of the Australia national rugby league team 's jersey until the adoption of the green and gold . The Blues team is administered by the New South Wales Rugby League and the Maroons by the Queensland Rugby League . The New South Wales team are sometimes referred to by the nickname `` Cockroaches '' and the Queensland team as `` Cane Toads '' , due to names given to them by Barry Muir and Johnny Raper respectively . It was reinforced by a marketing campaign used in the 1980s where the respective teams were caricatured as such . </P> <P> Whilst other Australian states also have representative rugby league teams , they have not competed in State of Origin . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Interstate Rugby League prior to 1980 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first calls for a state of origin selection policy in interstate rugby football came before the schism between the union and league codes eventuated in Australia . In 1900 a journalist known as ' The Cynic ' wrote in The Referee that star rugby player and recent immigrant to Queensland , Stephen Spragg , should be able to play for his home state of New South Wales . </P> <P> Since the beginning of Australian rugby league in 1908 , an interstate competition between New South Wales and Queensland has been conducted from time to time . Until 1982 each team drew its players from the clubs based in that state . No consideration was given to the origins of the players themselves . </P> <P> The first of these interstate games was played at Sydney 's Agricultural Ground on 11 July 1908 , before Queensland had even commenced its club competition . New South Wales easily accounted for Queensland in a 43 -- 0 victory . The local media were unimpressed . </P> <Dl> <Dd> There can be no doubt the NSW men are improving a good deal ... They can not be blamed for the farce , for it was nothing else . If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it , one is afraid it will be found wanting . They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland . The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW , and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game . </Dd> <Dd> - The Sydney Morning Herald , 13 July 1908 </Dd> </Dl> <P> The interstate series was dominated by New South Wales , apart from a golden period for Queensland in the 1920s . From 1922 to 1925 Queensland defeated New South Wales 11 times in 12 matches . At the end of the 1925 season a Kangaroo team was to be picked for touring Great Britain . Instead of announcing an Australian team dominated by Queenslanders , the Australian Rugby League Board of Control informed the media that the Rugby Football League had decided that the Kiwis would provide stronger opposition , and that there would be no Australian tour . The period spanning 1922 to 1929 saw no Australian team play in Great Britain , the only such hiatus outside the two World Wars . </P> <P> The New South Wales dominance of interstate football increased after 1956 when gaming machines were legalised for all registered clubs in New South Wales . This provided New South Wales football clubs with a revenue source unmatched by Queensland clubs . From this time on an increasing number of Queensland players moved to the much stronger Sydney competition , becoming ineligible for Queensland state selection . Paul Hogan famously told a Queensland Rugby League gathering in 1977 that `` every time Queensland produces a good footballer , he finishes up being processed through a New South Wales poker machine . '' </P> <P> Prior to 1956 , NSW had won 75 % and Qld only 25 % of series played . From 1956 -- 1981 , NSW dominance soared even higher and Qld wins dwindled to only 3.8 % with only 1 series win , in 1959 . </P> <H3> Conception of State of Origin football ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the 1970s the prestige of interstate matches had been seriously downgraded . Matches were played mid-week , so as not to interfere with the Sydney club competition , and the small crowds in New South Wales were hosted at suburban grounds . Interstate football reached its nadir in 1977 when the New South Wales Rugby Football League ( NSWRFL ) declined to host the Queensland team , and both interstate games were played in Queensland . </P> <P> Former Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon , who had later become a journalist , was the first to suggest that Sydney - based Queenslanders should be available for selection to represent their state . </P> <P> Brisbane Courier - Mail reporter Hugh Lunn , Barry Maranta ( the future co-founder of the Brisbane Broncos ) and Maranta 's business partner Wayne Reid played a part in persuading QRL chairman Ron McAullife that the concept could be used in rugby league . Lunn told McAullife that `` you can take the Queenslander out of Queensland , Ron , but you ca n't take the Queensland out of the Queenslander . '' McAuliffe was initially sceptical . `` What if we recall our boys from Sydney to play , and we are beaten . Where would we go from there ? '' Reid spoke to NSWRFL president Kevin Humphreys and suggested that a one - off state of origin match could be used as a Test Match selection trial . </P> <P> New South Wales clubs were reticent in their support of the concept and set two conditions : </P> <Ul> <Li> If the third game was to decide the series it was not to act as a selection trial , and also , </Li> <Li> that the expatriate Queenslanders would be under the supervision of a representative of the NSWRFL whose duty it would be to protect the interests of both the NSWRFL and the clubs to which they were contracted . ( From 1980 this role was filled by Bob Abbott , a Cronulla - Sutherland Sharks official . ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Three Sydney clubs remained opposed to the plan : St. George Dragons , South Sydney Rabbitohs and Eastern Suburbs Roosters . As these clubs were refusing to release players , Humphreys threatened to make the game an official Australian Rugby League trial , which would make release mandatory . The clubs backed down . </P> <H3> Experimentation ( edit ) </H3> See also : 1980 State of Origin game and 1981 State of Origin game <P> After Queensland lost the first two interstate matches in 1980 ( 35 -- 3 and 17 -- 7 , the second game in front of only 1,638 Sydneysiders ) it was announced that a ' state of origin ' match would take place on 8 July at Lang Park in Brisbane . The New South Wales media gave both the event , and Queensland 's chance of winning it , little credence , calling the game a `` three day wonder '' . Australia 's 1978 captain Bob Fulton called the match `` the non-event of the century '' . Ron MacAullife however , was now committed to the concept and vigorously promoted the match . Thousands of tickets were sold before the game had been officially sanctioned . Although interstate matches in Brisbane had still been well attended ( 24,653 had attended the opening match of the 1979 series ) , few expected the sell - out crowd of 33,210 Queensland rugby league fans , delighted to see their heroes in the likes of Arthur Beetson representing their home state for the first time ever . Queensland convincingly beat New South Wales 20 -- 10 . </P> <P> I was strongly against such a match , but last night 's gripping clash showed that such a fixture would be a welcome addition to the League program . </P> -- Alan Clarkson , journalist for The Sydney Morning Herald , 6 October 1980 <P> In 1981 the first two interstate matches were again played under the old selection rules . As New South Wales won the first two matches in the series , state of origin selection rules were used once more in the third match . Although New South Wales ran out to an early 15 -- 0 lead in the game , Queensland rallied to win 22 -- 15 . </P> <H3> Adoption ( edit ) </H3> The first State of Origin shield , depicting Queensland 's Wally Lewis and New South Wales ' Brett Kenny . <P> The interest generated by the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 and the potential for financial rewards were enough to convince the authorities to play all three games under state of origin rules the following year . </P> <P> The State of Origin format is the only possible way to allow the interstate series to survive . </P> -- Frank Hyde ( 2 June 1982 ) <P> Despite the Maroons ' success so far in the State of Origin experiments , the New South Wales media dismissed the seriousness of the Queensland threat to the Blues ' long - held dominance in series wins . Queensland however , under the leadership of immortal captain Wally Lewis , was inspired by this , and for the first three State of Origin series Queensland won 2 matches to 1 . </P> <P> However , in 1985 , under the leadership of captain Steve Mortimer , New South Wales won the deciding match in front of 29,068 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground , claiming the series for the first time . The following year the Blues were able to go one better and complete the first state of origin whitewash , taking the series 3 -- 0 . </P> <H3> 1987 : American controversy ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Queensland had won the 1987 series 2 -- 1 , a fourth game was played at Long Beach , California to showcase rugby league to the American public . </P> <P> In Origin : Rugby League 's Greatest Contest 1980 -- 2002 ( 2003 ) Queensland writer Jack Gallaway tells a story : </P> <Dl> <Dd> There was one additional Origin contest played in 1987 . The Queenslanders had climbed the mountain and at no point did they take the project seriously in any competitive sense . The State of Origin trophy was safely stowed in the Queensland Rugby League board room at Lang Park , and for the Maroons the visit to the United States was their end - of - season outing , the game an exhibition ... Such was the Blues ' disappointment at the loss of the State of Origin series that they would go to any length to restore some vestige of their lost pride . The New South Wales Rugby League hierarchy told their men to prepare for the contest as though it was a deciding test match . The match was played at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach , California in front of 12,349 fans . The Blues won the game 30 -- 18 . </Dd> </Dl> <P> In 1987 the Australian Rugby League ( ARL ) , New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League agreed that the match would only count towards the players ' individual statistics . On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League ( whose primary members are originally from the New South Wales Rugby League ) announced that the fourth 1987 game was to be classified as an official match , and that a win in the state of origin match on 16 July 2003 would take New South Wales into the overall lead . </P> <P> ARL and NSWRL chief executive Geoff Carr said : `` There had been some debate over whether the Origin fixture ... in 1987 was counted as an official match but a search of ARL records has confirmed the status conferred on that clash by the game 's governing body at the time . In announcing the match in Big League in April 1987 , Ken Arthurson , the ARL 's chief executive in 1987 , was quoted as saying ' It 's an exciting experiment but the match is n't and wo n't be billed as an exhibition match ' . '' </P> <H3> 1990s ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the controversy of the match played in the United States , the Queensland halves pairing of Allan Langer and Wally Lewis led the Maroons in their 3 -- 0 series wins in both 1988 and 1989 . The rise of the Canberra Raiders in the then Winfield Cup club competition produced for the Blues the formidable halves combination of Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley who brought New South Wales back from defeat with two wins in the opening games of the 1990 series . It was evident that as the rivalry between the two states grew , the Origin matches had become much more physical forward orientated game than the open running play seen in earlier series . </P> <P> As the great Queensland players from the 1980s began to retire from the game , the Maroons struggled with a team of fresh faces and considerable inexperience . The 1992 , 1993 and 1994 series all went to NSW as the talent and experience of Blues players such as Brett Mullins , Daley and Stuart in the backs and Benny Elias and Bradley Clyde in the forwards gave the Blues the edge when the games were on the line . It was n't until the upheaval of the Super League war in 1995 that the Maroons were able to again clinch a series . </P> <P> A main cause for concern for Queensland was the fact that the Brisbane Broncos , its players and many other Queenslanders were not aligned with the ARL prohibiting any players signed with the Super League to play for the Maroons . Despite this the Queenslanders won the 1995 series 3 -- 0 in a shocking white - wash . The 1996 series saw the off - field contract dramas put aside as all players were allowed , regardless of contract , state of origin selection . Having the majority of the Queenslanders back did n't help the Maroons though as the Blues 1996 white - wash with a 3 -- 0 series win of their own . </P> <P> The Australian game divided in 1997 into two competitions , one run by the ARL and one by the News Limited - owned Super League , and an interstate series was played in each . Under the Super League banner there was a Tri-Origin series with a New Zealand side added to the competition . The ARL meanwhile stuck to its traditional format . The teams were selected using origin rules , and New South Wales and Queensland met twice . These matches do not count towards the official state of origin record . As with the premiership , players were spread between two representative tournaments as well . </P> <P> The competitions merged again in 1998 as the current National Rugby League , and the series that year proved to be enthralling as both sides won a game each away from home , setting up a decider at the Sydney Football Stadium where 39,000 fans witnessed the visiting Queenslanders take the series 2 -- 1 . The end of the decade saw a dramatic series with each side taking one game each and game three ending in a draw . Queensland were awarded the series as at the time the previous winners retained the interstate honours . </P> <H3> 2000s ( edit ) </H3> <P> The early to mid-2000s saw New South Wales starting to assert its traditional interstate dominance , causing some critics ( who ? ) to question the future of State of Origin . However , this imbalance tipped in the third and deciding game of the 2006 State of Origin series , which is seen as the starting point of Queensland 's unprecedented dynasty . Queensland followed by winning the 2007 series , as well as the 2008 series , which made Queensland 's streak three series in a row . New South Wales won Game 1 on 21 May 2008 , however Queensland won Game 2 on 11 June 2008 , and Game 3 on 2 July 2008 . Queensland continued to follow this up by winning the first two games of the 2009 series becoming the first state to win four series in a row . </P> <H3> 2010s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2010 , Queensland won its historic , record - breaking , fifth consecutive Origin series with a 23 -- 18 win in the third and final match . This was the first Queensland team to win all three consecutive State of Origin Games in 15 years . Queensland full back Billy Slater won man of the match in the third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series in 2010 . The 2010 State of Origin series was also the second televised program in Australia to be shot in 3D 1080i DVB - T as well as being simultaneously broadcast in regular 576i and 1080i DVB - T and PAL . </P> <P> In the first game of the 2011 series Queensland defeated New South Wales 16 -- 12 . In the second game New South Wales defeated Queensland 18 -- 8 . Queensland won the series 34 -- 24 in the 2011 decider in what was Queensland captain Darren Lockyer 's 36th and final game . Cameron Smith won man of the match in both the first and third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series . </P> <P> In 2012 , then NRL CEO David Gallop introduced the Under - 20s State of Origin for Toyota Cup players which saw New South Wales winning . Queensland went on to win a historic 7th series win in 2012 , winning the final game by 1 point . </P> <P> In 2013 , New South Wales defeated Queensland 14 to 6 in game 1 , Queensland defeated New South Wales 26 to 6 in game 2 , while in game 3 Queensland defeated New South Wales 12 to 10 to take out the overall Origin title for the eighth consecutive time . The 2013 series set a new State of Origin television ratings record for a whole series since the 2001 introduction of the ratings system . </P> <P> In 2014 , New South Wales defeated Queensland 12 - 8 in the first game of the series , and 6 - 4 in the second . In the third game Queensland defeated New South Wales 32 - 8 after scoring the first try of the game in the 37th minute , with Queensland leading 6 - 2 in the first half . This gave the Blues the first series win in 8 years . </P> <P> In 2015 , Queensland defeated New South Wales 11 - 10 in game 1 played in Sydney , New South Wales defeated Queensland 26 - 18 in game 2 played in Melbourne , Queensland defeated New South Wales 52 - 6 in game 3 played in Brisbane , winning the series 2 - 1 . </P> <P> In 2016 , Queensland defeated New South Wales 6 - 4 in game 1 and clinched the series with a 26 - 16 win in the second match . New South Wales closed off the series with a 18 - 14 win over Queensland . </P> <P> In 2017 , New South Wales won Game 1 , 28 - 4 sparking the New South Wales media to start proclaiming the beginning of the Blues Dynasty . Queensland won Game 2 , 18 - 16 after making changes to the team with the returning Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston , who kicked the winning goal for Queensland . Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match , essentially disabling it as he played out the whole match . Thurston was later ruled out for the rest of the year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a reconstruction , ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be his last representative year . In Game 3 , New South Wales went in with an unchanged lineup for all three games , the first to do so since 1996 . Queensland dominated the Blues , winning 22 - 6 , with Queensland winger Dane Gagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series . It also had Johnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron Smith , before being chaired off the ground by his teammates , ending Thurston 's representative career on a high note . </P> <P> In 2018 , New South Wales won their first State of Origin series in four years , defeating Queensland 22 -- 12 and 18 -- 14 in the first two games . Queensland scored a consolation victory 18 -- 12 in the final game . </P> <H2> Venues ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Queensland ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Venue </Th> <Th> City </Th> <Th> No. of Games </Th> <Th> Highest Crowd </Th> <Th> Lowest Crowd </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Lang Park ( Brisbane Stadium / Suncorp Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Brisbane </Td> <Td> 52 </Td> <Td> 52,540 </Td> <Td> 16,559 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre ( QE2 Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Brisbane </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 49,441 </Td> <Td> 47,989 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> New South Wales ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Venue </Th> <Th> City </Th> <Th> No. of Games </Th> <Th> Highest Crowd </Th> <Th> Lowest Crowd </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Stadium Australia ( Telstra Stadium / ANZ Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Sydney </Td> <Td> 25 </Td> <Td> 88,336 </Td> <Td> 55,421 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sydney Football Stadium ( Allianz Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Sydney </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> <Td> 41,955 </Td> <Td> 16,910 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) </Td> <Td> Sydney </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> 42,048 </Td> <Td> 20,242 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Interstate & International ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Venue </Th> <Th> City </Th> <Th> State </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> No. of Games </Th> <Th> Highest Crowd </Th> <Th> Lowest Crowd </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) </Td> <Td> Melbourne </Td> <Td> Victoria </Td> <Td> Australia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 91,513 </Td> <Td> 25,105 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Docklands Stadium ( Telstra Dome / Etihad Stadium ) </Td> <Td> Melbourne </Td> <Td> Victoria </Td> <Td> Australia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 56,021 </Td> <Td> 50,967 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Olympic Park Stadium </Td> <Td> Melbourne </Td> <Td> Victoria </Td> <Td> Australia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 25,800 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Veterans Memorial Stadium </Td> <Td> Long Beach </Td> <Td> California </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 12,439 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Popularity ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2013 , each individual game in the series drew a higher Australian television audience than any other sporting event . In recent years the series has gained popularity outside of New South Wales and Queensland , with games played in Melbourne drawing record crowds for rugby league and local television ratings comparable to those of some Victorian AFL matches . Internationally , the series is televised in 91 countries , and is a national obsession in Papua New Guinea , occasionally sparking riots , violence and deaths . It also draws a strong following in neighbouring New Zealand . </P> <H2> Broadcasting ( edit ) </H2> <P> Within Australia , Nine Network is the main broadcaster for the series , with replays airing on Fox Sports . The series is also broadcast on radio by ABC Grandstand . </P> <P> Setanta Sports broadcasts live matches in Asia . In the United States , Fox Soccer televised all matches live using the Nine feed since 2011 , with the coverage moving to Fox Sports 2 when Fox Soccer was discontinued in August 2013 . Premier Sports broadcasts live coverage of State of Origin in the UK . </P> <P> Another twist on the coverage was Roy and HG 's State of Origin commentary on Australian youth radio network Triple J . This broadcast was presented by the characters `` Rampaging '' Roy Slaven and HG Nelson ( played by John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver ) , who commentated the game with a unique comedic style . Roy and HG 's broadcasts began in the late 1980s , and continued until 2008 . Roy and HG moved from Triple J to radio network Triple M in 2009 , at which point the duo ceased their State of Origin commentary . </P> <H2> Selection rules ( edit ) </H2> Sydney Brisbane <P> Under State of Origin rules players were previously selected for the state in which they first played senior ( or registered ) rugby league . In 2012 , the NSWRL , CRL , QRL and ARLC agreed on new criteria in determining Origin eligibility , to encompass other factors , such as place of birth . Players must also be eligible to represent Australia at international level . </P> <H3> Controversy ( edit ) </H3> <P> From time to time the selection of players under the State of Origin rules creates controversy . Since 1980 , Queensland has completed just the 7 series with a team completely made up of players of a Queensland birth , while for New South Wales the total is only 6 . However , place of birth has only been a relevant factor in eligibility since 2012 . </P> <P> An issue of contention has been the selection of players such as Peter Sterling , Ken Nagas , James McManus , Israel Folau and Greg Inglis . Israel Folau was born and raised in New South Wales but is eligible to play for Queensland as he played his first senior rugby league match in Queensland . Ken Nagas was born and raised in Queensland but decided to play for New South Wales , Peter Sterling was born in Toowoomba , Queensland and raised in Wagga Wagga , Newcastle & Sydney , all in New South Wales , while McManus was born in Scotland and was raised in the Northern Territory , but was ruled eligible to play for New South Wales in the 2009 series . </P> <P> The selection of Greg Inglis by Queensland was disputed . The Queensland Rugby League selected him based on the fact that either Wavell State High School or Brisbane Norths was Inglis ' first senior football , making him eligible for both states per the rules at the time . However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High School in Newcastle , New South Wales , in the Arrive Alive Cup ; considered to be a senior competition . Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said `` there was some talk the other day that he was actually brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday but I was coach of the team . He played for us at 16 , he 's a Blue '' . The controversy led to the creation of the `` That 's In Queensland '' viral video . </P> <P> Due to the clarification of selection rules the Sims brothers are eligible for different States . Tariq and Ashton are eligible for New South Wales while Korbin Sims is eligible for Queensland . Previously father and son combinations , such as Steve and Mat Rogers have represented different states . This duo was especially notable because Mat was born in New South Wales and played for Queensland while Steve was born in Queensland and played for New South Wales . Steve Rogers played his first senior game of rugby league for the Southport Tigers on Queenslands Gold Coast </P> <P> Foreign born players have also represented each state . New Zealand has had several players , such as Brad Thorn , Ben Te'o , Craig Smith , Willie Mason , Tonie Carroll , James Tamou and Karmichael Hunt play Origin . Tamou 's selection by New South Wales in 2012 was controversial as he was born in Palmerston North and played for the Junior Kiwis , lived in New Zealand until he moved to Sydney when he was 13 and was included in the New Zealand Kiwis training squad for the 2011 Four Nations . Both Hunt and Tamou played for Australia before being selected for State of Origin . Other players , such as Sam Kasiano and Jason Taumalolo are also eligible , creating concern in the New Zealand Rugby League . Apart from representing Queensland , Brad Thorn is also a dual rugby international , having played international rugby league for Australia , and international rugby union for the All Blacks . </P> <P> Papua New Guinea - born Adrian Lam and Fijian - born Lote Tuqiri , Akuila Uate and Petero Civoniceva have also played Origin . Benny Elias was born in Lebanon and has played for and captained NSW . Mario Fenech was born in Malta and has played for NSW . The most recent case of a foreign born player being selected was the selection of former Samoan international , Ben Te'o , by Queensland in game three of the 2012 season . </P> <P> A report into eligibility based on a player 's birth state showed ; `` Of the 18 series that QLD has won , it had the greater percentage of non-State ( born ) players in its side on 14 of those occasions -- revealing a 77.8 % dependency . Of the 13 series that NSW has won , on five of those occasions it had the higher percentage of non-State ( born ) players across the series -- revealing a 38.5 % dependency . '' </P> <H3> Anomalies ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> In 1995 and 1997 Super League players were made ineligible for the ARL State of Origin series selection . This included most of Queensland 's usual team , who now played for the Super League affiliated Brisbane Broncos . The ARL hence decided to relax the rules in those years , allowing Queensland to select Adrian Lam who had previously played for Papua New Guinea . The 1995 Origin series was the scene of the biggest upset in Origin history when the relatively inexperienced Maroon 's swept aside NSW , who even without their Super League players could still boast a number of senior Origin and international players , 3 - 0 . </Li> <Li> During the 2000 World Cup a number of Australian players were granted dispensations to appear for other nations under the grandparent rule . The players affected were David Barnhill ( NSW ) , Kevin Campion ( Qld ) , Tonie Carroll ( Qld ) , Graham Mackay ( NSW ) , Willie Mason ( NSW ) , Luke Ricketson ( NSW ) , Lote Tuqiri ( Qld ) and Adrian Vowles ( Qld ) , </Li> </Ol> <H2> Results ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dd> For full results and statistics , see State of Origin results and statistics </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Year by year ( edit ) </H3> <P> Of the 36 full series played , Queensland have won 21 , New South Wales 14 , with 2 series drawn ( Queensland retained the Shield on both occasions as the previous year 's winner ) . With the addition of three one - off games that were played in 1980 , 1981 and 1987 , the total number of games played is 108 . Queensland have won 58 , New South Wales have won 51 , with 2 matches being drawn . </P> <P> The series of 1999 and 2002 are considered drawn series , as both New South Wales and Queensland won a single game of each 3 match series , with the final game concluding in a draw . At that time there was no overtime rule to break the deadlock , and by the same set of rules , Queensland retained the shield as they were the previous holders , but did not win the series . Due to controversy around the second drawn series , and the rule awarding the series champions to Queensland , the rules were subsequently changed to rule out drawn matches and series .

The three episodes were released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One between August and December 2017 . It is the second entry in the Life Is Strange series , set as a prequel to the first game , focusing on sixteen - year - old Chloe Price and her relationship with schoolmate Rachel Amber . Gameplay concerns itself mostly with the use of branching dialogues . </P> <P> Deck Nine started developing the game in 2016 , using the Unity game engine . Voice actors from the original game did not appear in Before the Storm on account of the SAG - AFTRA strike , but reprised their roles in a bonus episode once the strike was resolved . The soundtrack was created by Daughter . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay </Li> <Li> 2 Plot </Li> <Li> 3 Development </Li> <Li> 4 Release </Li> <Li> 5 Reception <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Awards </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> Chloe engages in a conversation with Rachel Amber ( pictured ) <P> Life Is Strange : Before the Storm is a graphic adventure played from a third - person view . The player assumes control of sixteen - year - old Chloe Price , three years prior to Life Is Strange . Unlike its predecessor , the game does not include time travel . Instead , Before the Storm features the ability `` Backtalk '' , with which the player can call upon Chloe to get out of certain precarious situations ; `` Backtalk '' may also make a situation worse . A dialogue tree is used when a conversation or commentary is prompted . Occasional decisions will temporarily or permanently change outcomes . The environment can be interacted with and altered , including marking walls with graffiti . </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In her hometown of Arcadia Bay , sixteen - year - old Chloe Price sneaks into a house concert at an old mill . Conflict arises with two men inside , whom she evades when schoolmate Rachel Amber causes a distraction . The next day , Chloe and Rachel reunite at Blackwell Academy and decide to ditch class , stowing away on a cargo train and ending up at a lookout point . They people - watch through a viewfinder and see a man and woman kiss in the park , which upsets Rachel . They steal wine from local campers and take a walk to a scrapyard . Chloe confronts Rachel about her change in mood , but is refused an answer . After Rachel leaves , Chloe discovers the wrecked car in which her father was killed . She meets up with Rachel again , who discloses that she witnessed her father , James , cheating on her mother through the viewfinder . Rachel destroys a family photo in a burning trash bin , and in a fit of rage kicks it over , igniting a wildfire . </P> <P> The next day , Chloe and Rachel are reprimanded by Principal Wells for ditching school . Chloe hides out at the scrapyard where she finds an old truck in need of repairing . She then receives a call from local drug dealer Frank Bowers , who arranges a meeting to discuss settling her debt with him . Chloe agrees to repay him by helping him steal money from her classmate Drew , who owes Frank a large sum . However , Chloe finds out that Drew is being violently extorted by another drug dealer , Damon Merrick , and she must decide whether to pay off the dealer with the stolen money to protect Drew or keep it . When later a student is unable to participate in the school 's theater production of The Tempest due to road closures from the wildfire , Chloe reluctantly takes on the role opposite Rachel . After the play , they decide to leave Arcadia Bay with the newly repaired truck and return to Rachel 's house to pack . There , following a confrontation , James reveals that the woman they saw him kissing was not a mistress , but in fact Rachel 's biological mother . </P> <P> Rachel is told that her mother , Sera , is a drug addict , and that on the day her father kissed her , he had rejected Sera 's plea to see Rachel . Chloe vows to find Rachel 's mother , against James ' wishes . Chloe contacts Frank , who agrees to meet her at the scrapyard . She repairs the truck there before Rachel arrives . They are ambushed by Frank and Damon , who stabs Rachel after he realises she is the district attorney 's daughter . Surviving the wound , Rachel recovers at the hospital . Chloe continues the search by investigating James ' office for clues about Sera , instead revealing that James has been in contact with Damon ; Chloe uses James ' phone to convince Damon to disclose where Sera is located , and finds out that Damon has kidnapped her for ransom . She races to Damon to pay him off , but learns when she reaches him that James wanted him to kill Sera . Frank appears and fights Damon , after which Sera entreats that Chloe never tell Rachel about James ' actions . Back at the hospital , Chloe is faced with a choice : tell Rachel everything or protect her from the truth . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Publisher Square Enix chose Deck Nine to develop the prequel to Life Is Strange after the developer 's proprietary StoryForge tools had made an impression . Development started in 2016 with the Unity game engine . Rhianna DeVries , who initially did the game 's motion capture for Chloe Price , voices the character , while the original voice actress Ashly Burch serves as writing consultant . Burch did not reprise her role due to the SAG - AFTRA strike . With the strike over , Burch and Hannah Telle , who voiced Max Caulfield in Life Is Strange , will return for a bonus episode . The game went under different working titles during casting , according to Kylie Brown , who was cast as Rachel Amber ( then codenamed Rebecca ) in February 2017 . The music was written and performed by the British indie folk band Daughter , and released as an official soundtrack by Glassnote Records on 1 September 2017 . Instrumentation was employed to represent different sides of the lead character : piano for isolation , electric guitar for rebelliousness , and layered vocals for friendship . Daughter took the script and concept artwork as inspiration . The writers researched memoirs and psychology to understand the grieving process of the main character . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Prior to its official announcement , images had leaked online indicating that a prequel to Life Is Strange was in development . Square Enix revealed Life Is Strange : Before the Storm on 11 June during E3 2017 , stating that it would be released over three chapters starting on 31 August for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One . The Deluxe Edition includes the bonus chapter `` Farewell '' -- featuring Max Caulfield of the original game as a playable character -- three additional outfits , and Mixtape Mode , allowing players to customise playlists with the game 's soundtrack . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Episode </Th> <Th> Release date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 1 : Awake '' </Td> <Td> 31 August 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 2 : Brave New World '' </Td> <Td> 19 October 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 3 : Hell Is Empty '' </Td> <Td> 20 December 2017 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Aggregate review scores <Tr> <Th> Game </Th> <Th> Metacritic </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Episode 1 : Awake </Th> <Td> ( PC ) 77 / 100 ( PS4 ) 78 / 100 ( XONE ) 80 / 100 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Episode 2 : Brave New World </Th> <Td> ( PC ) 78 / 100 ( PS4 ) 79 / 100 ( XONE ) 76 / 100 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Critics appraised Episode 1 : Awake the most on its character development of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber . Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found Chloe 's behaviour `` endearing '' and noted that her personality was portrayed with multiple layers . Sam Loveridge at GamesRadar wrote that Rachel was the more authentic character on account of her more `` grounded '' dialogue . Despite disparaging Chloe for being `` her same tiresomely combative self '' early on , Metro saw her fleshed out by enduring the loss of her father . Game Informer 's Kimberley Wallace thought the younger version of Chloe brought a `` naivety and vulnerability '' worthy of sympathy . Conversely , the relationship between the leads was said to have formed `` at unnatural speed '' . Peeples and Loveridge favoured the `` Backtalk '' gameplay feature , while Metro and Wallace cared little for it . Otherwise lauded were the story , graphics , voice acting , and soundtrack . </P> <P> Reviewers found Episode 2 : Brave New World to either be better than the first installment or one of the series ' greatest . Metro praised how choices made a difference with a `` profound effect '' on character arc , while Ozzie Mejia of Shacknews relished in Chloe 's `` genuine growth '' contrasting her `` fiery spirit '' . Similarly , Game Informer 's Joe Juba appreciated the continued comprehension of the character , declaring this `` its biggest strength '' . However , Juba 's biggest complaint echoed that of Wallace , in reference to the `` forced '' manner with which Chloe and Rachel are made friends . Brett Makedonski , writing for Destructoid , thought that the character exposition was done `` to great effect '' . Most noted was The Tempest school play sequence , which Metro stated as their favorite ; Mejia called `` one of the funniest '' in Before the Storm ; and Juba observed as the culmination of all past choices . Metro criticized the script for being `` uneven '' and disapproved of the voice acting . Mejia felt the ending could have been done away with , saying it was `` a bit drawn out '' , though he was impressed with the progression of the Backtalk feature . </P> <H3> Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following E3 2017 , Life Is Strange : Before the Storm received one of GamesRadar 's Best of E3 awards and was nominated for Hardcore Gamer 's Adventure Game award . It was nominated in the Games for Impact category at The Game Awards 2017 . At the 2017 Golden Joystick Awards , it was nominated for Best Audio . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Additional work by Square Enix London Studios </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Robertson , John ( 12 July 2017 ) . `` Life is Strange : Before the Storm is Chloe 's game '' .

where is sodom and gomorrah located in the bible,on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan,"Sodom and Gomorrah - wikipedia <H1> Sodom and Gomorrah </H1> Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the biblical cities . For other uses , see Sodom and Gomorrah ( disambiguation ) . The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , John Martin , 1852 Sodom and Gomorrah being destroyed in the background of Lucas van Leyden 's 1520 painting Lot and his Daughters <P> Sodom and Gomorrah ( / ˈsɒdəm / ; / ɡəˈmɔːrə / ) were cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis and throughout the Hebrew Bible , the New Testament and in the deuterocanonical books , as well as in the Quran and the hadith . </P> <P> According to the Torah , the kingdoms of Sodom and Gomorrah were allied with the cities of Admah , Zeboim and Bela . These five cities , also known as the `` cities of the plain '' ( from Genesis in the Authorized Version ) , were situated on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan . The plain , which corresponds to the area just north of the modern - day Dead Sea , was compared to the garden of Eden as being well - watered and green , suitable for grazing livestock . </P> <P> Divine judgment by God was passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities , which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone . Neighboring Zoar ( Bela ) was the only city to be spared . In Abrahamic religions , Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin , and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution . Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as metaphors for vice and homosexuality , although a close reading of the text and other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this association may be incorrect . </P> <P> The story has therefore given rise to words in several languages . These include the English word sodomy , which is used in sodomy laws to describe sexual `` crimes against nature '' , namely anal or oral sex ( particularly homosexual ) , or bestiality . Some Islamic societies incorporate punishments associated with Sodom and Gomorrah into sharia . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 Historicity </Li> <Li> 3 In the Book of Genesis <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Battle of Siddim </Li> <Li> 3.2 The Judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Other references <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Moses </Li> <Li> 4.2 Major Prophets </Li> <Li> 4.3 Minor Prophets </Li> <Li> 4.4 New Testament </Li> <Li> 4.5 Deuterocanonical references </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Religious views <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Jewish </Li> <Li> 5.2 Christian </Li> <Li> 5.3 Islamic </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Modern Sodom </Li> <Li> 7 Second World War </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The etymology of both names is uncertain . The exact original meanings of the names are also uncertain . Some believe , the name Sodom ( Hebrew : סְדֹם  Səḏōm ) could be a word from an early Semitic language ultimately related to the Arabic sadama , meaning `` fasten '' , `` fortify '' , `` strengthen '' , but that is unlikely as the Gesenius ' Hebrew - Chaldee Lexicon defines the hebrew word Sodom ( Cēdom ) as burning . Gomorrah ( Hebrew : עֲמֹרָה  ' Ămōrāh ) could be based on the root gh mr , which means `` be deep '' , `` copious ( water ) , '' but this is also in dispute as it is classically known as עֲמֹרָה ʻĂmôrâh , am - o - raw ' ; from H6014 ; a ( ruined ) heap ; Amorah , a place in Palestine : -- Gomorrah . </P> <H2> Historicity ( edit ) </H2> Painting from William Francis Lynch book The Narrative of the United States Expedition of the River Jordan and the Dead Sea . Published in 1849 <P> There are other stories and historical names which bear a resemblance to the Biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah . Some possible natural explanations for the events described have been proposed , but no widely accepted or strongly verified sites for the cities have been found . Of the five `` cities of the plain '' , only Bela , modern - day Zoara , is securely identified , and it remained a settlement long after the biblical period . </P> <P> The ancient Greek historiographer Strabo states that locals living near Moasada ( as opposed to Masada ) say that `` there were once thirteen inhabited cities in that region of which Sodom was the metropolis '' . Strabo identifies a limestone and salt hill at the south western tip of the Dead Sea , and Kharbet Usdum ( Hebrew : הר סדום , Har Sedom or Arabic : جبل السدوم , Jabal ( u ) ' ssudūm ) ruins nearby as the site of biblical Sodom . Archibald Sayce translated an Akkadian poem describing cities that were destroyed in a rain of fire , written from the view of a person who escaped the destruction ; the names of the cities are not given . However , Sayce later mentions that the story more closely resembles the doom of Sennacherib 's host . </P> <P> In 1976 Giovanni Pettinato claimed that a cuneiform tablet that had been found in the newly discovered library at Ebla contained the names of all five of the cities of the plain ( Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboim , and Bela ) , listed in the same order as in Genesis . The names si - da - mu ( TM. 76. G. 524 ) and ì - ma - ar ( TM. 75. G. 1570 and TM. 75. G. 2233 ) were identified as representing Sodom and Gomorrah , which gained some acceptance at the time . However , Alfonso Archi states that , judging from the surrounding city names in the cuneiform list , si - da - mu lies in northern Syria and not near the Dead Sea , and ì - ma - ar is a variant of ì - mar , known to represent Emar , an ancient city located near Ebla . Today , the scholarly consensus is that `` Ebla has no bearing on ... Sodom and Gomorra . '' </P> <P> Certain skeptics of the biblical account have theorized that , provided that the cities existed at all , that they might have been destroyed by natural disaster . One such idea is that the Dead Sea was devastated by an earthquake between 2100 and 1900 BCE . This might have unleashed showers of steaming tar . It is possible that the towns were destroyed by an earthquake , especially if they lay along a major fault such as the Jordan Rift Valley . There is a lack of contemporary accounts of seismic activity within the necessary timeframe , however , to corroborate this theory . Another idea is that the destruction was caused by the plume of a meteor that impacted in the Alps , as possibly shown in a planisphere inscribed on a cuneiform tablet . </P> <P> In 1973 , Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub discovered or visited a number of possible sites of the cities , including Bab edh - Dhra , which was originally excavated in 1965 by archaeologist Paul Lapp , and later finished by Rast and Schaub following his death . Other possibilities include Numeira , al - Safi , Feifa , and Khanazir , which were also visited by Schaub and Rast . Each of the sites were near the Dead Sea and showed evidence of burning and traces of sulfur . According to Schaub , however , who dug at Bab edh - Dhra , Numeira was destroyed in 2600 BCE at a different time period than Bab edh - Dhra ( 2350 -- 2067 BCE ) . Archaeological remains excavated from Bab edh - Dhra are currently displayed in Karak Archaeological Museum ( Karak Castle ) , Amman Citadel Museum , and the British Museum . </P> <P> Another candidate for Sodom is the Tall el Hammam dig site which began in 2006 under the direction of Steven Collins . Tall el Hammam is located in the southern Jordan river valley approximately 14 kilometres ( 9 mi ) northeast of the Dead Sea , and according to Collins fits the biblical descriptions of the lands of Sodom . The ongoing dig is a result of joint cooperation between Trinity Southwest University and the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan . </P> <P> Professor Eugene H. Merrill believes that the identification of Tall el - Hammam with Sodom would require an unacceptable restructuring of the biblical chronology . </P> <P> The Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient biblical city of Sodom . He refers to the lake by its Greek name , Asphaltites . </P> <H2> In the Book of Genesis ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Sodom and Gomorrah 's political situation is described when Lot had encamped in Sodom 's territory . At this time , `` the men of Sodom ( were ) wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly '' . Sodom was ruled by King Bera while Gomorrah was ruled by King Birsha . Their kingship , however , was not sovereign , because all of the river Jordan plain was under Elamite rule for 12 years . The kingdom of Elam was ruled by King Chedorlaomer . In the 13th year of subjugation to Elam , the five kings of the river Jordan plain allied to rebel against Elamite rule . These kings included those of Sodom and Gomorrah as well as their neighbors : King Shinab of Admah , King Shemeber of Zeboiim , and the unnamed king of Bela ( later called Zoar ) . </P> <P> In response , Elam 's King Chedorlaomer , gathered additional forces from Shinar , Ellasar and Goyim to suppress this rebellion from the cities of the plain . They waged war in the Vale of Siddim in the 14th year . The battle was brutal with heavy losses in the cities of the plain , with their resultant defeat , Genesis 14 : 10 . Sodom and Gomorrah were spoiled of their goods , and captives were taken , including Lot . The tide of war turned when Lot 's uncle , Abraham , gathered an elite force that slaughtered King Chedorlaomer 's forces in Hobah , north of Damascus . The success of his mission freed the cities of the plain from under Elam 's rule . </P> <H3> The judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah ( edit ) </H3> See also : Hospitality § Judaism <P> The story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in Genesis 18 - 19 . Three men , thought by most commentators to have been angels appearing as men , came to Abraham in the plains of Mamre . After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah , his wife , `` the Lord '' revealed to Abraham that he would confirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah , `` and because their sin is very grievous '' . </P> <P> In response , Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it , to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein . Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers ( first 45 , then 40 , then 30 , then 20 , and finally at 10 ) , with the Lord agreeing each time . Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham 's nephew Lot , who convinced the angels to lodge with him , and they ate with Lot . </P> <P> Genesis 19 : 4 - 5 described what followed , which confirmed its end : </P> <P> 4 But before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both young and old , all the people from every quarter . 5 And they called unto Lot , and said unto him : ' Where are the men that came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them . ' </P> <P> ( NRSV : know them , NIV : can have sex with them , NJB : can have intercourse with them ) . </P> Sodom and Gomorrah from the Nuremberg Chronicle by Hartmann Schedel , 1493 . Lot 's wife , already transformed into a salt pillar , is in the center . <P> Lot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and , instead , offered them his two virgin daughters `` which have not known man '' and to `` do ye to them as ( is ) good in your eyes '' . However , they refused this offer , complained about this alien , namely Lot , giving orders , and then came near to break down the door . Lot 's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city . Then ( not having found even 10 righteous people in the city ) , they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave . As they made their escape , one angel commanded Lot to `` look not behind thee '' ( singular `` thee '' ) . However , as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with brimstone and fire from the Lord , Lot 's wife looked back at the city , and she became a pillar of salt . </P> <H2> Other references ( edit ) </H2> <P> Major and minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible have referred to Sodom and Gomorrah to parallel their prophetic events . The New Testament also contains passages of parallels to the destruction and surrounding events that pertained to these cities and those who were involved . Later deuterocanonical texts attempt to glean additional insights about these cities of the Jordan Plain and their residents . </P> <H3> Moses ( edit ) </H3> <P> Moses referred to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Deuteronomy 29 : 22 - 23 : </P> <P> `` Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it . The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur -- nothing planted , nothing sprouting , no vegetation growing on it . It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboyim , which the Lord overthrew in fierce anger . '' -- NIV </P> <P> See also : Deuteronomy 32 : 32 - 33 </P> <H3> Major prophets ( edit ) </H3> <P> Isaiah 1 : 9 - 10 , Isaiah 3 : 9 and Isaiah 13 : 19 - 22 addresses people as from Sodom and Gomorrah , associates Sodom with shameless sinning and tells Babylon that it will end like those two cities . </P> <P> Jeremiah 23 : 14 , Jeremiah 49 : 17 - 18 , Jeremiah 50 : 39 - 40 and Lamentations 4 : 6 associate Sodom and Gomorrah with adultery and lies , prophesies the fate of Edom , south of the Dead Sea , predicts the fate of Babylon and uses Sodom as a comparison . </P> <P> In Ezekiel 16 : 48 - 50 , God compares Jerusalem to Sodom , saying `` Sodom never did what you and your daughters have done . '' He explains that the sin of Sodom was that `` She and her daughters were arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy . They were haughty and did detestable things before me . '' </P> <H3> Minor prophets ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Amos 4 : 1 - 11 , God tells the Israelites that although he treated them like Sodom and Gomorrah , they still did not repent . </P> <P> In Zephaniah 2 : 9 , Zephaniah tells Moab and Ammon , southeast and northeast of the Dead Sea , that they will end up like Sodom and Gomorrah . </P> <H3> New Testament ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Matthew 10 : 1 - 15 , cf . Luke 10 : 1 - 12 , Jesus declares certain cities more damnable than Sodom and Gomorrah , due to their response to Jesus ' disciples , in the light of greater grace ( RSV ) : </P> <P> `` And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town . Truly , I say to you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town . '' </P> <P> In Matthew 11 : 20 - 24 , Jesus prophesies the fate of some cities where he did some of his works ( RSV ) : </P> <P> `` And you , Caper'na - um , will you be exalted to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades . For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day . But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you . '' </P> <P> In Luke 17 : 28 - 30 , Jesus compares his second - coming to the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah ( RSV ) : </P> <P> `` Likewise as it was in the days of Lot -- they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built , but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them all -- so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed . '' </P> <P> In Romans 9 : 29 , Paul the Apostle quotes Isaiah 1 : 9 ( RSV ) : `` And as Isaiah predicted , ' If the Lord of hosts had not left us children , we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomor'rah . ' '' </P> <P> In 2 Peter 2 : 4 - 10 , Saint Peter says that just as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and saved Lot , he will deliver godly people from temptations and punish the wicked on Judgement Day . </P> <P> Jude 1 : 7 records that both Sodom and Gomorrah were `` giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire '' . </P> <P> Revelation 11 : 7 - 8 makes an allegorical use of Sodom when it describes the places where the two witnesses will descend during the Apocalypse . </P> <H3> Deuterocanonical references ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wisdom 10 : 6 - 8 refers to the Five Cities : </P> <P> Wisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing ; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities . Evidence of their wickedness still remains : a continually smoking wasteland , plants bearing fruit that does not ripen , and a pillar of salt standing as a monument to an unbelieving soul . For because they passed wisdom by , they not only were hindered from recognizing the good , but also left for mankind a reminder of their folly , so that their failures could never go unnoticed . </P> <P> Wisdom 19 : 17 says that the Egyptians who enslaved the Israelites were `` struck with blindness , like the men of Sodom who came to the door of that righteous man Lot . They found themselves in total darkness , as each one groped around to find his own door . '' </P> <P> Sirach 16 : 8 says `` ( God ) did not spare the neighbors of Lot , whom he loathed on account of their insolence . '' </P> <P> In 3 Maccabees 2 : 5 , the high priest Simon says that God `` consumed with fire and sulphur the men of Sodom who acted arrogantly , who were notorious for their vices ; and you made them an example to those who should come afterward '' . </P> <P> 2 Esdras 2 : 8 - 9 says `` Woe to you , Assyria , who conceal the unrighteous in your midst ! O wicked nation , remember what I did to Sodom and Gomor ′ rah , whose land lies in lumps of pitch and heaps of ashes . So will I do to those who have not listened to me , says the Lord Almighty . '' </P> <P> 2 Esdras 5 : 1 - 13 describes signs of the end times , one of which is that `` the sea of Sodom shall cast up fish '' . </P> <P> In 2 Esdras 7 : 106 , Ezra says that Abraham prayed for the people of Sodom . </P> <H2> Religious views ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jewish ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rictor Norton views classical Jewish texts as stressing the cruelty and lack of hospitality of the inhabitants of Sodom to the `` stranger '' . The people of Sodom were seen as guilty of many other significant sins . Rabbinic writings affirm that the Sodomites also committed economic crimes , blasphemy and bloodshed . One of the worst was to give money or even gold ingots to beggars , after inscribing their names on them , and then subsequently refusing to sell them food . The unfortunate stranger would end up starving and after his death , the people who gave him the money would reclaim it . </P> <P> Jon D. Levenson views a rabbinic tradition described in the Mishnah as postulating that the sin of Sodom was a violation of conventional hospitality in addition to homosexual conduct , describing Sodom 's lack of generosity with the saying , `` What is mine is mine ; what is yours is yours '' ( m . Avot 5.10 ) . </P> <P> A modern orthodox position is one that holds , `` The paradigmatic instance of such aberrant behavior is found in the demand of the men of Sodom to ' know ' the men visiting Lot , the nephew of Abraham , thus lending their name to the practice of ' sodomy ' . '' </P> <P> Jay Michaelson proposes a reading of the story of Sodom that emphasizes the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites . `` Homosexual rape is the way in which they violate hospitality -- not the essence of their transgression . Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax . '' Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham 's hospitality to strangers , and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom , they do so without commentary on homosexuality . The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23 : 14 , where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery , lying , and strengthening the hands of evildoers ; Amos 4 : 1 - 11 ( oppressing the poor and crushing the needy ) ; and Ezekiel 16 : 49 - 50 , which defines the sins of Sodom as `` pride , fullness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy . And they were haughty , and did toevah before me , and I took them away as I saw fit . '' Michaelson uses toevah in place of abomination to emphasize the original Hebrew , which he explains as being more correctly translated as `` taboo '' . </P> <H3> Christian ( edit ) </H3> <P> Several theories have been advanced in Christian thought concerning the sin of Sodom . One area of dispute is whether the mob was demanding the homosexual rape of Lot 's guests . A second area of dispute is whether the act of homosexuality or the act of inhospitality and violence towards foreigners is the more significant ethical downfall of Sodom . </P> <P> The first contention between the two positions primarily focuses upon the meaning of the Hebrew verb ידע ( yada ) , translated as know in the King James Version : </P> <P> And they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where ( are ) the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them . -- Genesis 19 : 5 </P> <P> However , the word `` know '' in the King James Version has been used to refer to sexual intercourse . One example can be found in Genesis 4 : 1 between Adam and Eve : </P> <P> And Adam knew Eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Cain , and said , I have gotten a man from the LORD. -- Genesis 4 : 1 </P> <P> Some Hebrew scholars believe that yada , unlike the English word know , requires the existence of a `` personal and intimate relationship '' . For this reason , many of the most popular of the 20th century translations , including the New International Version , the New King James Version , and the New Living Translation , translate yada as `` have sex with '' or `` know ... carnally '' in Gen 19 : 5 </P> <P> Those who favor the non-sexual interpretation argue against a denotation of sexual behavior in this context , noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures , only approximately 1 % ( 13 -- 14 times ) of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy . Instead , those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers . </P> <P> Countering this is the observation that one of the examples of know meaning to know sexually occurs when Lot responds to the Gen 19 : 5 request , by offering his daughters for rape , only three verses later in the same narrative : </P> <P> Behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ... -- Genesis 19 : 8 </P> <P> The following is a major text in regard to these conflicting opinions : </P> <P> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire . -- Jude 1 : 7 </P> <P> This reference to `` going after strange flesh '' is understood in different ways to include something akin to bestiality , having illicit sex with strangers , having sex with angels , but most often God 's destruction of the populations of the four cities is interpreted to mean homosexual ( same - sex ) relations . </P> <P> Many who interpret the stories in a non-sexual context contend that as the word for `` strange '' is akin to `` another '' , `` other '' , `` altered '' or even `` next '' , the meaning is unclear , and if the condemnation of Sodom was the result of sexual activities perceived to be perverse , then it is likely that it was because women sought to commit fornication with `` other than human '' angels , perhaps referring to Genesis 6 or the apocryphal Book of Enoch . Countering this , it is pointed out that Genesis 6 refers to angels seeking women , not men seeking angels , and that both Sodom and Gomorrah were engaged in the sin Jude describes before the angelic visitation , and that , regardless , it is doubtful that the Sodomites knew they were angels . In addition , it is argued the word used in the King James Version of the Bible for `` strange '' , can mean unlawful or corrupted ( Rm. 7 : 3 ; Gal. 1 : 6 ) , and that the apocryphal Second Book of Enoch ( different from the Book of Enoch which Jude quotes from ) condemns `` sodomitic '' sex ( 2 Enoch 10 : 3 ; 34 : 1 ) , thus indicating that homosexual relations was the prevalent physical sin of Sodom . </P> <P> Both the non-sexual and the homosexuality view invoke certain classical writings as well as other portions of the Bible . </P> <P> Now this was the sin of Sodom : She and her daughters were arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy . They were haughty and did detestable things before me . Therefore I did away with them as you have seen . -- Ezekiel 16 : 49 - 50 </P> <P> Here the nonsexual view focuses on the inhospitality aspect , while the other notes the description detestable or abomination , the Hebrew word for which often denotes moral sins , including those of a sexual nature . </P> <P> In the Gospel of Matthew ( and corresponding verse ) when Jesus warns of a worse judgment for some cities than Sodom , inhospitality is perceived by some as the sin , while others see it fundamentally being impenitence : </P> <P> If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words , shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town . I tell you the truth , it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town . -- Matthew 10 : 14 - 15 </P> <P> The nonsexual view focuses on the cultural importance of hospitality , which this biblical story shares with other ancient civilizations , such as Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome , where hospitality was of singular importance and strangers were under the protection of the gods . </P> <P> Within the Christian Churches that agree on the possible sexual interpretation of know ( yada ) in this context , there is still a difference of opinion on whether homosexuality is important . On its website , the Anglican Communion presents the argument that the story is `` not even vaguely about homosexual love or relationships '' , but is instead `` about dominance and rape , by definition an act of violence , not of sex or love '' . This argument that the violence and the threat of violence towards foreign visitors is the true ethical downfall of Sodom ( and not homosexuality ) , also observes the similarity between the Sodom and Gomorrah and the Battle of Gibeah Bible stories . In both stories , an inhospitable mob demands the homosexual rape of a foreigner or foreigners . As the mob instead settles for the rape and murder of the foreigner 's female concubine in the Battle of Gibeah story , the homosexual aspect is generally seen as inconsequential , and the ethical downfall is understood to be the violence and the threat of violence towards foreigners by the mob . This Exodus 22 : 21 - 24 lesson is viewed by Anglicans as a more historically accurate way to interpret the Sodom and Gomorrah story . </P> <H3> Islamic ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Lot in Islam <P> The Quran contains twelve references to `` the people of Lut '' , the biblical Lot , but meaning the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah ( references 6 : 86 - 90 ; 7 : 80 -- 84 ; 11 : 74 -- 83 ; 15 : 58 - 77 ; 21 : 74 - 75 ; 26 : 160 -- 173 ; 27 : 54 -- 58 ; 29 : 28 -- 30 , 33 - 35 ; 37 : 133 - 138 ; 51 : 32 - 37 ; 54 : 33 - 38 and 66 : 10 ) , and their destruction by God is associated explicitly with their sexual practices : </P> <P> The ' people of Lot ' transgressed consciously against the bounds of God . Their avarice led to inhospitality and robbery , which in turn led to the humiliation of strangers by mistreatment and rape . It was their abominable sin of homosexual sex which was seen as symptomatic of their attitudes , and upon Lot 's exhorting them to abandon their transgression against God , they ridiculed him , and threatened him with dire consequences ; Lot only prayed to God to be saved from doing as they did . Then Gabriel met Lot and said that he must leave the city quickly , as God had given this command to Lot for saving his life . In the Quran it was written that Lot 's wife stayed behind as she had transgressed . She met her fate in the disaster , and only Lot and his family were saved during the destruction of their city , with the understanding that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are identified in Genesis , but `` the location remains unnamed in the Qur'an '' </P> <P> In the Quran , surah ( chapter ) 26 Ash - Shu ` arā ' ( The Poets ) -- </P> <P> So , We saved him and his family , all . Except an old woman among those who remained behind . </P> -- Quran 26 : 170 -- 171 <P> Commentary : This was his wife , who was a bad old woman . She stayed behind and was destroyed with whoever else was left . This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al - A ` raf and Surat Hud , and in Surat Al - Hijr , where Allah commanded him to take his family at night , except for his wife , and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people . So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered , and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all , and rained upon them stones of baked clay , piled up . </P> -- Tafsir ibn Kathir ( Commentary by Ibn Kathir ) <H2> Modern Sodom ( edit ) </H2> <P> The site of the present Dead Sea Works , a large operation for the extraction of Dead Sea minerals , is called `` Sdom '' ( סדום ) according to its traditional Arab name , Khirbet as - sudūm ( خربت السدوم ) . Nearby is Mount Sodom ( הר סדום in Hebrew and جبل السدوم in Arabic ) which consists mainly of salt . In the Plain of Sdom ( מישור סדום ) to the south there are a few springs and two small agricultural villages , Neot Hakikar and Ein Tamar . </P> <H2> Second World war ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` Operation Gomorrah '' was the appropriate name given to the Bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 , in which 42,600 civilians were killed , and where use of incendiaries caused a vortex and whirling updraft of super-heated air which created a 460 meter high tornado of fire . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> The Bible and homosexuality </Li> <Li> Bab edh - Dhra and Numeira , two adjacent archeological sites said by some to be the two cities ' locations </Li> <Li> Christianity and homosexuality </Li> <Li> Christianity and sexual orientation </Li> <Li> Homosexuality and Judaism </Li> <Li> Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible </Li> <Li> LGBT in Islam </Li> <Li> Religion and homosexuality </Li> <Li> Religion and LGBT people </Li> <Li> Tripura , cities likewise destroyed by divine intervention as described in Hindu mythology </Li> <Li> Vayeira , the Torah portion concerning Sodom and Gomorrah </Li> <Li> Xenia </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide '' .

As the successor to the original Xbox , it is the second console in the Xbox series . It competed with Sony 's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12 , 2005 , with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 E3 expo . </P> <P> The Xbox 360 features an online service , Xbox Live , which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console 's lifetime . Available in free and subscription - based varieties , Xbox Live allows users to : play games online ; download games ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) and game demos ; purchase and stream music , television programs , and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals ; and access third - party content services through media streaming applications . In addition to online multimedia features , it allows users to stream media from local PCs . Several peripherals have been released , including wireless controllers , expanded hard drive storage , and the Kinect motion sensing camera . The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming - only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for living - room computing entertainment . </P> <P> Launched worldwide across 2005 -- 2006 , the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions , including North America and Europe . The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate , indicated by the so - called `` Red Ring of Death '' , necessitating an extension of the device 's warranty period . Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console : the Xbox 360 S in 2010 , and the Xbox 360 E in 2013 . As of June 2014 , 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide , making it the sixth - highest - selling video game console in history , and the highest - selling console made by an American company . Although not the best - selling console of its generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live . </P> <P> The Xbox 360 's successor , the Xbox One , was released on November 22 , 2013 . On April 20 , 2016 , Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware , although the company will continue to support the platform . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Development </Li> <Li> 1.2 Launch </Li> <Li> 1.3 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 1.4 Sales </Li> <Li> 1.5 Legacy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Hardware <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Technical specifications </Li> <Li> 2.2 Accessories <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Kinect </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.3 AV output </Li> <Li> 2.4 Retail configurations <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Timeline </Li> <Li> 2.4. 2 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.5 Technical problems </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Software <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Games </Li> <Li> 3.2 Interface <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 New Xbox Experience </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Multimedia </Li> <Li> 3.4 XNA community </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Services <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Xbox Live </Li> <Li> 4.2 Xbox Live Marketplace </Li> <Li> 4.3 Xbox Live Arcade </Li> <Li> 4.4 Movies & TV </Li> <Li> 4.5 Groove Music </Li> <Li> 4.6 Xbox SmartGlass </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Game development </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History </H2> <H3> Development </H3> <P> Known during development as Xbox Next , Xenon , Xbox 2 , Xbox FS or NextBox , the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003 . In February 2003 , planning for the Xenon software platform began , and was headed by Microsoft 's Vice President J Allard . That month , Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue , Washington to recruit support for the system . Also that month , Peter Moore , former president of Sega of America , joined Microsoft . On August 12 , 2003 , ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console , a deal which was publicly announced two days later . Before the launch of the Xbox 360 , several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple 's Power Mac G5 hardware . This was because the system 's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM 's Xenon processor . The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3 's Cell Processor PPE architecture . According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps , the IBM employees were `` hiding '' their work from Sony and Toshiba , IBM 's partners in developing the Cell Processor . Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox 360 . </P> <H3> Launch </H3> Main article : Xbox 360 launch <P> The Xbox 360 was released on November 22 , 2005 , in the United States and Canada ; December 2 , 2005 , in Europe and December 10 , 2005 , in Japan . It was later launched in Mexico , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , India , and Russia . In its first year on the market , the system launched in 36 countries , more countries than any other console has launched in a single year . </P> <H3> Critical reception </H3> <P> In 2009 , IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth - greatest video game console of all time , out of a field of 25 . Although not the best - selling console of the seventh - generation , the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential , by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live , and by popularizing game achievement awards . PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it `` proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space '' . Five years after the Xbox 360 's original debut , the well - received Kinect motion capture camera was released , which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history , and extended the life of the console . Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second - best console of the 1993 -- 2013 period , stating `` It had its own social network , cross-game chat , new indie games every week , and the best version of just about every multiformat game ... Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza , but it 's not about the exclusives -- there 's nothing to trump Naughty Dog 's PS3 output , after all . Rather , it 's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox 's lifetime . The PC - like architecture meant the early EA Sports games ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3 , Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list , and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next - generation exclusive . And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad -- another industry benchmark , and a critical one .

Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site eBay during the initial week of release , 10 % of the total supply . By year 's end , Microsoft had shipped 1.5 million units , including 900,000 in North America , 500,000 in Europe , and 100,000 in Japan . </P> <P> In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the `` first current generation gaming console '' to surpass the 10 million figure in the US . In the US , the Xbox 360 was the leader in current - generation home console sales until June 2008 , when it was surpassed by the Wii . The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1 , 2008 . Between January 2011 and October 2013 , the Xbox 360 was the best - selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months . </P> <P> In Europe , the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20 , 2008 , according to Microsoft . In the United Kingdom , the Xbox 360 has sold 3.9 million units as of June 27 , 2009 , according to GfK Chart - Track . </P> <P> While the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan , selling just 450,000 by November 2011 , the Xbox 360 sold almost as poorly , selling only 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011 . Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan , where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo , had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely . The significance of Japan 's poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales . </P> <H3> Legacy </H3> <P> The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor , and although not the best - selling console of the seventh generation , it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well - established rivals . The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third - party software support in its later years , and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012 . The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games , making it far less dominant than its predecessor , the PlayStation 2 , and it took until late in the PlayStation 3 's lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360 . TechRadar proclaimed that `` Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill -- a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor , Xbox One '' . </P> <P> The Xbox 360 's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high - profile games from both first party and third party developers . The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins -- more than any other platform . By March 2008 , the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US ; the rate was 7.0 in Europe , while its competitors were 3.8 ( PS3 ) and 3.5 ( Wii ) , according to Microsoft . At the 2008 Game Developers Conference , Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year . As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War , the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives , including Devil May Cry 4 , Ace Combat 6 , Virtua Fighter 5 , Grand Theft Auto IV , Final Fantasy XIII , Tekken 6 , Metal Gear Solid : Rising , and L.A. Noire . In addition , Xbox 360 versions of cross-platform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007 , due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3 . </P> <P> TechRadar deemed the Xbox 360 as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution , Xbox Live online gaming service , and game achievement feature . During the console 's lifetime , the Xbox brand has grown from gaming - only to encompassing all multimedia , turning it into a hub for `` living - room computing environment '' . Five years after the Xbox 360 's original debut , the well - received Kinect motion capture camera was released , which became the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history , and extended the life of the console . </P> <P> Microsoft announced the Xbox One , successor to the Xbox 360 , at E3 on June 10 , 2013 . Although succeeded as Microsoft 's main console by the Xbox One , support from publishers for the Xbox 360 is expected to continue until at least 2016 . On April 20 , 2016 , Microsoft announced the end of production of new Xbox 360 hardware ; the company will continue to provide hardware and software support for the platform , as selected Xbox 360 games can be played on Xbox One . </P> <H2> Hardware </H2> The Xbox 360 E model , announced at 2013 's E3 , shares many aesthetics with the Xbox One . <P> The main unit of the Xbox 360 itself has slight double concavity in matte white or black . The official color of the white model is Arctic Chill . It features a port on the top when vertical ( left side when horizontal ) to which a custom - housed hard disk drive unit can be attached . </P> <P> On the Slim and E models , the hard drive bay is on the bottom when vertical ( right side when horizontal ) and requires the opening of a concealed door to access it . ( This does not void the warranty . ) The Xbox 360 Slim / E hard drives are standard 2.5 '' SATA laptop drives , but have a custom enclosure and firmware so that the Xbox 360 can recognize it . </P> <H3> Technical Specifications </H3> Main article : Xbox 360 technical specifications <P> Various hard disk drives have been produced , including options at 20 , 60 , 120 , 250 , or 320 GB . Inside , the Xbox 360 uses the triple - core IBM designed Xenon as its CPU , with each core capable of simultaneously processing two threads , and can therefore operate on up to six threads at once . Graphics processing is handled by the ATI Xenos , which has 10 MB of eDRAM . Its main memory pool is 512 MB in size . </P> <H3> Accessories </H3> Main article : Xbox 360 accessories <P> Many accessories are available for the console , including both wired and wireless controllers , faceplates for customization , headsets for chatting , a webcam for video chatting , dance mats and Gamercize for exercise , three sizes of memory units and five sizes of hard drives ( 20 , 60 , 120 , 250 ( initially Japan only , but later also available elsewhere ) and 320 GB ) , among other items , all of which are styled to match the console . </P> Kinect Main article : Kinect A Kinect sensor device . The Xbox 360 E revision has an Xbox logo to the left of the Xbox 360 branding . <P> Kinect is a `` controller - free gaming and entertainment experience '' for the Xbox 360 . It was first announced on June 1 , 2009 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , under the codename , Project Natal . The add - on peripheral enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a game controller by using gestures , spoken commands and presented objects and images . The Kinect accessory is compatible with all Xbox 360 models , connecting to new models via a custom connector , and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter . During their CES 2010 keynote speech , Robbie Bach and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer went on to say that Kinect will be released during the holiday period ( November -- January ) and work with every 360 console .

The original shipment of the Xbox 360 version included a cut - down version of the Media Remote as a promotion . The Elite package was launched later at US $479 . The `` Xbox 360 Core '' was replaced by the `` Xbox 360 Arcade '' in October 2007 and a 60 GB version of the Xbox 360 Pro was released on August 1 , 2008 . The Pro package was discontinued and marked down to US $249 on August 28 , 2009 to be sold until stock ran out , while the Elite was also marked down in price to US $299 . </P> <P> Two major hardware revisions of the Xbox 360 have succeeded the original models ; the Xbox 360 S ( also referred to as the `` Slim '' ) replaced the original `` Elite '' and `` Arcade '' models in 2010 . The S model carries a smaller , streamlined appearance with an angular case , and utilizes a redesigned motherboard designed to alleviate the hardware and overheating issues experienced by prior models . It also includes a proprietary port for use with the Kinect sensor . The Xbox 360 E , a further streamlined variation of the 360 S with a two - tone rectangular case inspired by Xbox One , was released in 2013 . In addition to its revised aesthetics , the Xbox 360 E also has one fewer USB port , no AV connector ( and thus is HDMI - only ) , and no longer supports S / PDIF . </P> Timeline United States <P> November 22 , 2005 </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 Premium ( 20 GB ) -- $399.99 </Li> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 Core -- $299.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> April 29 , 2007 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch Xbox 360 Elite ( 120 GB ) -- $479.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> August 6 , 2007 </P> <Ul> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Premium ( 20 GB ) -- $349.99 </Li> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Core -- $279.99 </Li> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite -- $449.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> October 27 , 2007 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 Arcade -- $279.99 </Li> <Li> Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Core </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <P> July 13 , 2008 </P> <Ul> <Li> Discontinuation of Xbox 360 ( 20 GB ) ( price cut to $299.99 for remaining stock ) </Li> </Ul> <P> August 1 , 2008 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 Premium ( 60 GB ) -- $349.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> September 5 , 2008 </P> <Ul> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite -- $399.99 </Li> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 ( 60 GB ) -- $299.99 </Li> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Arcade -- $199.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> August 28 , 2009 </P> <Ul> <Li> Discontinuation of Xbox 360 ( 60 GB ) ( price cut to $249.99 for remaining stock ) </Li> <Li> Price cut on Xbox 360 Elite -- $299.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <P> June 19 , 2010 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 S 250 GB -- $299.99 </Li> <Li> Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Elite ( price cut to $249.99 for remaining stock ) </Li> <Li> Discontinuation of Xbox 360 Arcade ( price cut to $149.99 for remaining stock ) </Li> </Ul> <P> August 3 , 2010 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 S 4 GB -- $199.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> June 10 , 2013 </P> <Ul> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 E 4 GB -- $199.99 </Li> <Li> Launch of Xbox 360 E 250 GB -- $299.99 </Li> </Ul> <P> April 20 , 2016 </P> <Ul> <Li> Discontinuation of all Xbox 360 models . </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Technical problems </H3> Main article : Xbox 360 technical problems Three red lights on the Xbox 360 's ring indicator representing a `` General Error requiring service of the Console or Power Adapter , '' commonly nicknamed the `` Red Ring of Death . '' <P> The Xbox 360 ( not Slim and E models ) has been subject to a number of technical problems . Since the console 's release in 2005 , users have reported concerns over its reliability and failure rate . </P> <P> To aid customers with defective consoles , Microsoft extended the Xbox 360 's manufacturer 's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a `` General Hardware Failure '' error report . A `` General Hardware Failure '' is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red . This error is often known as the `` Red Ring of Death '' . In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code . The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes . </P> <P> Since these problems surfaced , Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability . Modifications include a reduction in the number , size , and placement of components , the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion , and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat . With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S , the warranty for the newer models does not include the three - year extended coverage for `` General Hardware Failures '' . The newer Xbox 360 S and E models indicate system overheating when the console 's power button begins to flash red , unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred . The system will then warn the user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled , whereas a flashing power button that alternates between green and red is an indication of a `` General Hardware Failure '' unlike older models where three of the quadrants would light up red . </P> <H2> Software </H2> <H3> Games </H3> Main article : List of Xbox 360 games See also : List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360 Rock of Ages , one of many Unreal Engine 3 powered games available on Xbox 360 . <P> The Xbox 360 launched with 14 games in North America and 13 in Europe . The console 's best - selling game for 2005 , Call of Duty 2 , sold over a million copies . Five other games sold over a million copies in the console 's first year on the market : Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter , The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , Dead or Alive 4 , Saints Row , and Gears of War . Gears of War would become the best - selling game on the console with 3 million copies in 2006 , before being surpassed in 2007 by Halo 3 with over 8 million copies . </P> <P> Six games were initially available in Japan , while eagerly anticipated games such as Dead or Alive 4 and Enchanted Arms were released in the weeks following the console 's launch . Games targeted specifically for the region , such as Chromehounds , Ninety - Nine Nights , and Phantasy Star Universe , were also released in the console 's first year . Microsoft also had the support of Japanese developer Mistwalker , founded by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi . Mistwalker 's first game , Blue Dragon , was released in 2006 and had a limited - edition bundle which sold out quickly with over 10,000 pre-orders . Blue Dragon is one of three Xbox 360 games to surpass 200,000 units in Japan , along with Tales of Vesperia and Star Ocean : The Last Hope . Mistwalker 's second game , Lost Odyssey also sold over 100,000 copies . </P> <P> The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the Xbox 360 platform with 38 Nominations and 11 Wins . </P> <H3> Interface </H3> Main article : Xbox 360 system software <P> The Xbox 360 's original graphical user interface was the Xbox 360 Dashboard ; a tabbed interface that featured five `` Blades '' ( formerly four blades ) , and was designed by AKQA and Audiobrain . It could be launched automatically when the console booted without a disc in it , or when the disc tray was ejected , but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up , or if inserted when already on . A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad . This simplified version showed the user 's gamercard , Xbox Live messages and friends list . It also allowed for personal and music settings , in addition to voice or video chats , or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game . </P> <P> On November 19 , 2008 , the Xbox 360 's dashboard was changed from the `` Blade '' interface , to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center , known as the `` New Xbox Experience '' or NXE . </P> <P> Since the console 's release , Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software . These updates have included adding new features to the console , enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities , adding compatibility for new accessories , and fixing bugs in the software . Such updates are mandatory for users wishing to use Xbox Live , as access to Xbox Live is disabled until the update is performed . </P> New Xbox Experience Further information : Xbox Live § New Xbox Experience <P> At E3 2008 , at Microsoft 's Show , Microsoft 's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the `` New Xbox Experience '' ( NXE ) . The update was intended to ease console menu navigation . Its GUI uses the Twist UI , previously used in Windows Media Center and the Zune . Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality ( including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection ) and the original `` Blade '' interface ( although the color scheme has been changed to match that of the NXE Dashboard ) . </P> <P> The NXE also provides many new features . Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise , but each game 's disc must remain in the system in order to run . A new , built - in Community system allows the creation of digitized Avatars that can be used for multiple activities , such as sharing photos or playing Arcade games like 1 vs. 100 . The update was released on November 19 , 2008 . </P> <P> While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory , the NXE update was the first to require a storage device -- at least a 128 MB memory card or a hard drive . </P> <P> Microsoft released a further update to the Xbox 360 Dashboard starting on December 6 , 2011 . It included a completely new user interface which utilizes Microsoft 's Metro design language , and added new features such as cloud storage for game saves and profiles , live television , Bing voice search , access to YouTube videos and better support for Kinect voice commands . </P> <H3> Multimedia </H3> <P> The Xbox 360 supports videos in Windows Media Video ( WMV ) format ( including high - definition and PlaysForSure videos ) , as well as H. 264 and MPEG - 4 media . The December 2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of MPEG - 4 ASP format videos . The console can also display pictures and perform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects , and supports audio playback , with music player controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button . Users may play back their own music while playing games or using the dashboard , and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer . </P> <P> Music , photos and videos can be played from standard USB mass storage devices , Xbox 360 proprietary storage devices ( such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives ) , and servers or computers with Windows Media Center or Windows XP with Service pack 2 or higher within the local - area network in streaming mode . As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the UPnP AV protocol , some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare ( part of the GeeXboX project ) and MythTV can also stream media to the Xbox 360 , allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers . This is possible with video files up to HD - resolution and with several codecs ( MPEG - 2 , MPEG - 4 , WMV ) and container formats ( WMV , MOV , TS ) . </P> <P> As of October 27 , 2009 , UK and Ireland users are also able to access live and on - demand streams of Sky television programming . </P> <P> At the 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 Consumer Electronics Shows , Microsoft had announced that IPTV services would soon be made available to use through the Xbox 360 . In 2007 , Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was expected to be available to consumers by the holiday season , using the Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform . In 2008 , Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom , in which the BT Vision advanced TV service , using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform , would be accessible via Xbox 360 , planned for the middle of the year . BT Vision 's DVR - based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity . In 2010 , while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&T 's U-verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set - top boxes later in the year . As of January 2010 , IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials . </P> <P> In 2012 , Microsoft released the Live Event Player , allowing for events such as video game shows , beauty pageants , award shows , concerts , news and sporting events to be streamed on the console via Xbox Live . The first live events streamed on Live were the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods , Microsoft 's E3 2012 media briefing and the Miss Teen USA 2012 beauty pageant . </P> <H3> XNA Community </H3> Main article : Microsoft XNA <P> XNA Community is a feature whereby Xbox 360 owners can receive community - created games , made with Microsoft XNA Game Studio , from the XNA Creators Club . The games are written , published , and distributed through a community managed portal . XNA Community provides a channel for digital videogame delivery over Xbox Live that can be free of royalties , publishers and licenses . XNA game sales , however , did not meet original expectations . though Xbox Live Indie Games ( XBLIG ) has had some `` hits . '' </P> <H2> Services </H2> <H3> Xbox Live </H3> Main article : Xbox Live <P> When the Xbox 360 was released , Microsoft 's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade , adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver ( later renamed Xbox Live Free ) to its already established premium subscription - based service ( which was renamed Gold ) . Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console . It allows users to create a user profile , join on message boards , and access Microsoft 's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members . A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming ; however , some games that have rather limited online functions already , ( such as Viva Piñata ) or games that feature their own subscription service ( e.g. EA Sports games ) can be played with a Free account . Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the Xbox Live Vision . </P> <P> Xbox Live Gold includes the same features as Free and includes integrated online game playing capabilities outside of third - party subscriptions . Microsoft has allowed previous Xbox Live subscribers to maintain their profile information , friends list , and games history when they make the transition to Xbox Live Gold . To transfer an Xbox Live account to the new system , users need to link a Windows Live ID to their gamertag on Xbox.com . When users add an Xbox Live enabled profile to their console , they are required to provide the console with their passport account information and the last four digits of their credit card number , which is used for verification purposes and billing . An Xbox Live Gold account has an annual cost of US $59.99 , C $ 59.99 , NZ $ 90.00 , GB £ 39.99 , or € 59.99 . On January 5 , 2011 , Xbox Live had reached over 30 million subscribers . </P> <H3> Xbox Live Marketplace </H3> Main article : Xbox Live Marketplace <P> The Xbox Live Marketplace is a virtual market designed for the console that allows Xbox Live users to download purchased or promotional content . The service offers movie and game trailers , game demos , Xbox Live Arcade games and Xbox 360 Dashboard themes as well as add - on game content ( items , costumes , levels etc . ) . These features are available to both Free and Gold members on Xbox Live . A hard drive or memory unit is required to store products purchased from Xbox Live Marketplace . In order to download priced content , users are required to purchase Microsoft Points for use as scrip ; though some products ( such as trailers and demos ) are free to download . Microsoft Points can be obtained through prepaid cards in 1,600 and 4,000 - point denominations . Microsoft Points can also be purchased through Xbox Live with a credit card in 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 and 5,000 - point denominations . Users are able to view items available to download on the service through a PC via the Xbox Live Marketplace website . An estimated seventy percent of Xbox Live users have downloaded items from the Marketplace . </P> <H3> Xbox Live Arcade </H3> Main article : Xbox Live Arcade <P> Xbox Live Arcade is an online service operated by Microsoft that is used to distribute downloadable video games to Xbox and Xbox 360 owners . In addition to classic arcade games such as Ms. Pac - Man , the service offers some new original games like Assault Heroes . The Xbox Live Arcade also features games from other consoles , such as the PlayStation game Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and PC games such as Zuma . The service was first launched on November 3 , 2004 , using a DVD to load , and offered games for about US $5 to $15 . Items are purchased using Microsoft Points , a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges . On November 22 , 2005 , Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the Xbox 360 , in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360 's dashboard . The games are generally aimed toward more casual gamers ; examples of the more popular games are Geometry Wars , Street Fighter II ' Hyper Fighting , and Uno . On March 24 , 2010 , Microsoft introduced the Game Room to Xbox Live . Game Room is a gaming service for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows that lets players compete in classic arcade and console games in a virtual arcade . </P> DVD - ROM for Xbox 360 <H3> Movies & TV </H3> Main article : Microsoft Movies & TV <P> On November 6 , 2006 , Microsoft announced the Xbox Video Marketplace , an exclusive video store accessible through the console .

They can also use their mobile device as a remote to control the Xbox 360 console . </P> <H2> Game development </H2> <P> PartnerNet , the developers - only alternative Xbox Live network used by developers to beta test game content downloads and games developed for Xbox Live Arcade , runs on Xbox 360 debug kits , which are used both by developers and by the gaming press . In a podcast released on February 12 , 2007 , a developer breached the PartnerNet non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) by commenting that he had found a playable version of Alien Hominid and an unplayable version of Ikaruga on PartnerNet . A few video game journalists , misconstruing the breach of the NDA as an invalidation of the NDA , immediately began reporting on other games being tested via PartnerNet , including a remake of Jetpac . ( Alien Hominid for the Xbox 360 was released on February 28 of that year , and Ikaruga was released over a year later on April 9 , 2008 . Jetpac was released for the Xbox 360 on March 28 , 2007 as Jetpac Refuelled . ) There have also been numerous video and screenshot leaks of game footage on PartnerNet , as well as a complete version of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 : Episode I , which caused for the whole PartnerNet service to be shut down overnight on April 3 , 2010 . In the following days , Microsoft reminded developers and journalists that they were in breach of NDA by sharing information about PartnerNet content and asked websites to remove lists of games in development that were discovered on the service. . Sega used feedback from fans about the leaked version of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 : Episode I to refine it before they eventually released it . Additionally , a pair of hackers played their modded Halo 3 games on PartnerNet in addition to using PartnerNet to scoop up unreleased and untested software . The duo passed their hacked Halo pics to their friends before they were eventually caught by Bungie engineers who left a message for the hackers on PartnerNet which read `` Winners Do n't Break Into PartnerNet . '' . Other games that were leaked in the PartnerNet fiasco include Shenmue and Shenmue 2 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Xbox 360 games </Li> <Li> List of original programs distributed by Xbox Entertainment Studios </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Radd , David ( August 16 , 2005 ) . `` Xbox 360 Manufacturers Revealed '' .

who spread the theory that one is a product of the mind and body,René Descartes,"Philosophy of mind - wikipedia <H1> Philosophy of mind </H1> Jump to : navigation , search A phrenological mapping of the brain -- phrenology was among the first attempts to correlate mental functions with specific parts of the brain although it is now largely discredited . <P> Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind . The mind -- body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind , although other issues are addressed , such as the hard problem of consciousness , and the nature of particular mental states . Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events , mental functions , mental properties , consciousness , the ontology of the mind , the nature of thought , and the relationship of the mind to the body . </P> <P> Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind -- body problem , although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly . Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition , in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy , and Plato , but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century . Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance , whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and can not be reduced to the brain , but that it is not a distinct substance . </P> <P> Monism is the position that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities ( independent substances ) . This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza . Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist , and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve . Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties ( many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism ) , and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear . Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself , or an illusion created by the mind . Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world can be thought of as either mental ( psychological ) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter , and dual - aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other , neutral substance , and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance . The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism ; these positions include behaviorism , the type identity theory , anomalous monism and functionalism . </P> <P> Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position , maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body . These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences , especially in the fields of sociobiology , computer science , evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences . Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states . Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance , mental properties supervene on physical properties , or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable , and can not be reduced to the language and lower - level explanations of physical science . Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues ; however , they are far from being resolved . Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Mind -- body problem </Li> <Li> 2 Dualist solutions to the mind -- body problem <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Arguments for dualism </Li> <Li> 2.2 Interactionist dualism </Li> <Li> 2.3 Other forms of dualism <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Psychophysical parallelism </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Occasionalism </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 Property dualism </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Dual aspect theory </Li> <Li> 2.3. 5 Experiential dualism </Li> <Li> 2.3. 6 Hylomorphism </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Monist solutions to the mind -- body problem <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Physicalistic monisms <Ul> <Li> 3.1. 1 Behaviorism </Li> <Li> 3.1. 2 Identity theory </Li> <Li> 3.1. 3 Functionalism </Li> <Li> 3.1. 4 Non-reductive physicalism </Li> <Li> 3.1. 5 Weak emergentism </Li> <Li> 3.1. 6 Eliminative materialism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2 Non-physicalist monisms <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Idealism </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Neutral monism </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Mysterianism </Li> <Li> 5 Linguistic criticism of the mind -- body problem </Li> <Li> 6 Externalism and internalism </Li> <Li> 7 Naturalism and its problems <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Qualia </Li> <Li> 7.2 Intentionality </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Philosophy of perception </Li> <Li> 9 Philosophy of mind and science <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Neurobiology </Li> <Li> 9.2 Computer science </Li> <Li> 9.3 Psychology </Li> <Li> 9.4 Cognitive science </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition </Li> <Li> 11 Mind in Eastern philosophy <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Mind in Hindu philosophy <Ul> <Li> 11.1. 1 Dualism </Li> <Li> 11.1. 2 Vedanta monistic idealism </Li> <Li> 11.1. 3 Materialism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11.2 Buddhist philosophy of mind <Ul> <Li> 11.2. 1 Abhidharma theories of mind </Li> <Li> 11.2. 2 Indian Mahayana </Li> <Li> 11.2. 3 Tibetan Buddhism </Li> <Li> 11.2. 4 Zen Buddhism </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Topics related to philosophy of mind <Ul> <Li> 12.1 Free will </Li> <Li> 12.2 Self </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 13 See also </Li> <Li> 14 References </Li> <Li> 15 Further reading </Li> <Li> 16 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Mind -- body problem ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Mind -- body problem <P> The mind -- body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds , or mental processes , and bodily states or processes . The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states / processes , and how -- or even if -- minds are affected by and can affect the body . </P> <P> Our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world , and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states , ultimately causing us to feel a sensation , which may be pleasant or unpleasant . Someone 's desire for a slice of pizza , for example , will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants . The question , then , is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties . </P> <P> A related problem is how someone 's propositional attitudes ( e.g. beliefs and desires ) cause that individual 's neurons to fire and muscles to contract . These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of René Descartes . </P> <H2> Dualist solutions to the mind -- body problem ( edit ) </H2> <P> Dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter ( or body ) . It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are , in some respects , non-physical . One of the earliest known formulations of mind -- body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy ( c. 650 BCE ) , which divided the world into purusha ( mind / spirit ) and prakriti ( material substance ) . Specifically , the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind . </P> <P> In Western Philosophy , the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of Plato who maintained that humans ' `` intelligence '' ( a faculty of the mind or soul ) could not be identified with , or explained in terms of , their physical body . However , the best - known version of dualism is due to René Descartes ( 1641 ) , and holds that the mind is a non-extended , non-physical substance , a `` res cogitans '' . Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with consciousness and self - awareness , and to distinguish this from the brain , which was the seat of intelligence . He was therefore the first to formulate the mind -- body problem in the form in which it still exists today . </P> <H3> Arguments for dualism ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common - sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter . If asked what the mind is , the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self , their personality , their soul , or some other such entity . They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain , or vice versa , finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic , or simply unintelligible . Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties , along with empirical evidence from the sciences , to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them . </P> <P> Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different , and perhaps irreconcilable , properties . Mental events have a subjective quality , whereas physical events do not . So , for example , one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like , or what a blue sky looks like , or what nice music sounds like to a person . But it is meaningless , or at least odd , to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like . </P> <P> Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events `` qualia '' or `` raw feels '' . There is something that it is like to feel pain , to see a familiar shade of blue , and so on . There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical . David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something , such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red , but still not know something fundamental about the situation -- what it is like to see the color red . </P> <P> If consciousness ( the mind ) can exist independently of physical reality ( the brain ) , one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness . Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality . One possible explanation is that of a miracle , proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche , where all mind -- body interactions require the direct intervention of God . </P> <P> Another possible argument that has been proposed by C.S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason : if , as monism implies , all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes , then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground . Knowledge , however , is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent . Therefore , if monism is correct , there would be no way of knowing this -- or anything else -- we could not even suppose it , except by a fluke . </P> <P> The zombie argument is based on a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody , and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind . The basic idea is that one can imagine one 's body , and therefore conceive the existence of one 's body , without any conscious states being associated with this body . Chalmers ' argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it . Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena , and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics , the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one . Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent , or unlikely , concept . It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie , or that no one can be a zombie -- following from the assertion that one 's own conviction about being ( or not being ) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else 's . This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that `` Zombies think they are conscious , think they have qualia , think they suffer pains -- they are just ' wrong ' ( according to this lamentable tradition ) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover ! '' See also the problem of other minds . </P> <H3> Interactionist dualism ( edit ) </H3> Portrait of René Descartes by Frans Hals ( 1648 ) <P> Interactionist dualism , or simply interactionism , is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations . In the 20th century , its major defenders have been Karl Popper and John Carew Eccles . It is the view that mental states , such as beliefs and desires , causally interact with physical states . </P> <P> Descartes ' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows : Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension ( i.e. , it can not be measured in terms of length , weight , height , and so on ) . He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended , subject to quantification and not able to think . It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties . </P> <P> At the same time , however , it is clear that Seth 's mental states ( desires , beliefs , etc . ) have causal effects on his body and vice versa : A child touches a hot stove ( physical event ) which causes pain ( mental event ) and makes her yell ( physical event ) , this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver ( mental event ) , and so on . </P> <P> Descartes ' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be `` clear and distinct '' ideas in his mind are necessarily true . Many contemporary philosophers doubt this . For example , Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one 's own ideas . Freud claimed that a psychologically - trained observer can understand a person 's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does . Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person 's methods of discovery better than that person herself does , while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person 's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are . He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes ' argument , because scientists can describe a person 's perceptions better than the person herself can . </P> <H3> Other forms of dualism ( edit ) </H3> Four varieties of dualism . The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions . Occasionalism is not shown . Psychophysical parallelism ( edit ) <P> Psychophysical parallelism , or simply parallelism , is the view that mind and body , while having distinct ontological statuses , do not causally influence one another . Instead , they run along parallel paths ( mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events ) and only seem to influence each other . This view was most prominently defended by Gottfried Leibniz . Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance , the monad , exists in the universe , and that everything is reducible to it , he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between `` the mental '' and `` the physical '' in terms of causation . He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other . This is known as the doctrine of pre-established harmony . </P> Occasionalism ( edit ) <P> Occasionalism is the view espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events , or between physical and mental events , are not really causal at all . While body and mind are different substances , causes ( whether mental or physical ) are related to their effects by an act of God 's intervention on each specific occasion . </P> Property dualism ( edit ) <P> Property dualism is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of substance -- the physical kind -- and there exist two distinct kinds of properties : physical properties and mental properties . In other words , it is the view that non-physical , mental properties ( such as beliefs , desires and emotions ) inhere in some physical bodies ( at least , brains ) . How mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question , and is not always a clear issue . Sub-varieties of property dualism include : </P> <Ol> <Li> Strong emergentism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way ( i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized ) , mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws . Hence , it is a form of emergent materialism . These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and can not be reduced to , or explained in terms of , the physical substrate from which they emerge . They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge , but opinions vary as to the coherence of top -- down causation , i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties . A form of property dualism has been espoused by David Chalmers and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years , but was already suggested in the 19th century by William James . </Li> <Li> Epiphenomenalism is a doctrine first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley . It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual , where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects , but not the causes , of physical phenomena . Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events , but mental events can not cause anything , since they are just causally inert by - products ( i.e. epiphenomena ) of the physical world . This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson . </Li> <Li> Non-reductive Physicalism is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties : mental states ( such as qualia ) are not reducible to physical states . The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert ; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism . </Li> <Li> Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect , or , alternatively , all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view . Superficially , it seems to be a form of property dualism , since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties . However , some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules -- as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour , the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object . So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place , panpsychism is not a ( strong ) form of property dualism ; otherwise it is . </Li> </Ol> Dual aspect theory ( edit ) <P> Dual aspect theory or dual - aspect monism is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of , or perspectives on , the same substance . ( Thus it is a mixed position , which is monistic in some respects ) . In modern philosophical writings , the theory 's relationship to neutral monism has become somewhat ill - defined , but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental , physical , both , or neither , dual - aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations ( or aspects ) of some underlying substance , entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood . Various formulations of dual - aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary , mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable ( though distinct ) . </P> Experiential dualism ( edit ) <P> This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well - being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind . An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is `` experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable -- for instance , while engaging in a strenuous physical workout -- while mentally cheerful ; conversely , one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort '' . Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one . This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another . Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa . </P> <P> However , unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems , experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality : mind and matter . Rather , experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states . Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of Madhyamaka Buddhism . </P> <P> Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further , finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality . Nonetheless , this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct , rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality . </P> <P> In denying the independent self - existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience , the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism -- namely , physicalism -- that is characteristic of modern science . The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things - in - themselves , while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances , devoid of any reality in and of themselves . Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality . </P> <P> Indeed physicalism , or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality , is explicitly rejected by Buddhism . </P> <P> In the Madhyamaka view , mental events are no more or less real than physical events . In terms of our common - sense experience , differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena . While the former commonly have mass , location , velocity , shape , size , and numerous other physical attributes , these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena . For example , we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location . These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness , a recalled image from one 's childhood , the visual perception of a rose , or consciousness of any sort . Mental phenomena are , therefore , not regarded as being physical , for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena . Thus , Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real . </P> Hylomorphism ( edit ) Main article : Hylomorphism <P> Hylomorphism is a theory that originates with Aristotelian philosophy , which conceives being as a compound of matter and form . `` Hylomorphism '' is a 19th - century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη hyle , `` wood , matter '' , and μορφή , morphē , `` form '' . </P> <H2> Monist solutions to the mind -- body problem ( edit ) </H2> <P> In contrast to dualism , monism does not accept any fundamental divisions . The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia . In Indian and Chinese philosophy , monism is integral to how experience is understood . Today , the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist . Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical , in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science . However , a variety of formulations ( see below ) are possible . Another form of monism , idealism , states that the only existing substance is mental . Although pure idealism , such as that of George Berkeley , is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy , a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism , according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties , has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin . </P> <P> Phenomenalism is the theory that representations ( or sense data ) of external objects are all that exist . Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell and many of the logical positivists during the early 20th century . A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental . The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance . Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century . This neutral monism , as it is called , resembles property dualism . </P> <H3> Physicalistic monisms ( edit ) </H3> Behaviorism ( edit ) Main article : Behaviorism <P> Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century , especially the first half . In psychology , behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism . Introspective reports on one 's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and can not be used to form predictive generalizations . Without generalizability and the possibility of third - person examination , the behaviorists argued , psychology can not be scientific . The way out , therefore , was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life ( and hence an ontologically independent mind ) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior . </P> <P> Parallel to these developments in psychology , a philosophical behaviorism ( sometimes called logical behaviorism ) was developed . This is characterized by a strong verificationism , which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless . For the behaviorist , mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports . They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways , made by third parties to explain and predict another 's behavior . </P> <P> Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century , coinciding with the rise of cognitivism . Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems . For example , behaviorism could be said to be counterintuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache . </P> Identity theory ( edit ) Main article : Type physicalism <P> Type physicalism ( or type - identity theory ) was developed by John Smart and Ullin Place as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism . These philosophers reasoned that , if mental states are something material , but not behavioral , then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain . In very simplified terms : a mental state M is nothing other than brain state B . The mental state `` desire for a cup of coffee '' would thus be nothing more than the `` firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions '' . </P> The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast . For the Identity theory , every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds ( as indicated by the arrows ) to a physical token of a single physical type . For anomalous monism , the token -- token correspondences can fall outside of the type -- type correspondences . The result is token identity . <P> Despite its initial plausibility , the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of multiple realizability , first formulated by Hilary Putnam . It is obvious that not only humans , but many different species of animals can , for example , experience pain . However , it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state . And if this is the case , then pain can not be identical to a specific brain state . The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded . </P> <P> On the other hand , even granted the above , it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned . According to token identity theories , the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state . The type -- token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example : the word `` green '' contains four types of letters ( g , r , e , n ) with two tokens ( occurrences ) of the letter e along with one each of the others . The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events . Anomalous monism ( see below ) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token - identity theories . Despite these problems , there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today , primarily due to the influence of Jaegwon Kim . </P> Functionalism ( edit ) Main article : Functionalism ( philosophy of mind ) <P> Functionalism was formulated by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory . Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind . At about the same time or slightly after , D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles . Finally , Wittgenstein 's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning , further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman . Another one , psychofunctionalism , is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn . </P> <P> What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs . That is , functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties . For example , a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances . From this point of view , it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue , plastic nanotubes or silicon chips : it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney . </P> Non-reductive physicalism ( edit ) Main article : Physicalism <P> Non-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind -- body relations : 1 ) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states , but 2 ) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory : mental states can not be reduced to behavior , brain states or functional states . Hence , the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism . Donald Davidson 's anomalous monism is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism . He `` thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason , such as akrasia or self - deception , the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one , but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere . '' </P> <P> Davidson uses the thesis of supervenience : mental states supervene on physical states , but are not reducible to them . `` Supervenience '' therefore describes a functional dependence : there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical -- causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility . </P> <P> Because non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and to try to solve the `` surfeit of explanations puzzle '' in some way ; critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to epiphenomenalism , in that it is the brain that is seen as the root `` cause '' not the mind , and the mind seems to be rendered inert . </P> <P> Epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states , having no influence on physical states . The interaction is one - way ( solving the `` surfeit of explanations puzzle '' ) but leaving us with non-reducible mental states ( as a byproduct of brain states ) -- causally reducible , but ontologically irreducible to physical states . Pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states , though it might have effects on other mental states ( i.e. cause distress ) . </P> Weak emergentism ( edit ) Main article : Emergentism <P> Weak emergentism is a form of `` non-reductive physicalism '' that involves a layered view of nature , with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science . Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels , while others maintain that higher - order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction . The latter group therefore holds a less strict , or `` weaker '' , definition of emergentism , which can be rigorously stated as follows : a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration . </P> <P> Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H O ( water ) . In this example there `` emerges '' a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases . This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state . Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind -- body gap this way . One problem for emergentism is the idea of `` causal closure '' in the world that does not allow for a mind - to - body causation . </P> Eliminative materialism ( edit ) Main article : Eliminative materialism <P> If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common - sense psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive neuroscience , and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken , then one can adopt a final , more radical position : eliminative materialism . </P> <P> There are several varieties of eliminative materialism , but all maintain that our common - sense `` folk psychology '' badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition . Eliminativists such as Patricia and Paul Churchland argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence - like , the non-linguistic vector / matrix model of neural network theory or connectionism will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works . </P> <P> The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other , erroneous popular theories and ontologies that have arisen in the course of history . For example , Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries , but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model . The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the `` sentence - cruncher '' model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence - like states called `` propositional attitudes '' . </P> <H3> Non-physicalist monisms ( edit ) </H3> Idealism ( edit ) <P> Idealism is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting of minds , mental contents and or consciousness . Idealists are not faced with explaining how minds arise from bodies : rather , the world , bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds . However , accounting for the mind -- body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism ; rather , idealists tend to be motivated by skepticism , intentionality , and the unique nature of ideas . Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought . It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy . </P> <P> Different varieties of idealism may hold that there are </P> <Ul> <Li> multiple minds ( pluralistic idealism ) </Li> <Li> only one human mind ( solipsism ) </Li> <Li> or a single Absolute , Anima Mundi , One or Over-soul . </Li> </Ul> Neutral monism ( edit ) <P> Neutral monism , in philosophy , is the metaphysical view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements , which are themselves `` neutral '' , that is , neither physical nor mental . This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things . Rather , neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff , in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical . These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape , just as we experience those properties . But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind ( considered as a substantial entity , whether dualistically or physicalistically ) ; they exist on their own . </P> <H2> Mysterianism ( edit ) </H2> Main article : New mysterianism <P> Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind -- body problem is currently unsolvable , and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings . This is usually termed New mysterianism . Colin McGinn holds that human beings are cognitively closed in regards to their own minds . According to McGinn human minds lack the concept - forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis . An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics . </P> <P> A more moderate conception has been expounded by Thomas Nagel , which holds that the mind -- body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap . Nagel posits that in the future a sort of `` objective phenomenology '' might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis . </P> <H2> Linguistic criticism of the mind -- body problem ( edit ) </H2> <P> Each attempt to answer the mind -- body problem encounters substantial problems . Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion . These philosophers , such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism , therefore reject the problem as illusory . They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together . Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways -- for instance , in a mental and in a biological vocabulary . Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other 's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts . This is the case , for instance , if one searches for mental states of the brain . The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary -- the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning . </P> <P> Today , such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as Peter Hacker . However , Hilary Putnam , the originator of functionalism , has also adopted the position that the mind -- body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein . </P> <H2> Externalism and internalism ( edit ) </H2> <P> Where is the mind located ? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind , it has to be located somewhere . According to some , there are two possible options : either the mind is internal to the body ( internalism ) or the mind is external to it ( externalism ) . More generally , either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject 's body or it depends also on factors external to it . </P> <P> Proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind . Proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind . </P> <P> Externalism differentiates into several versions . The main ones are semantic externalism , cognitive externalism and phenomenal externalism . Each of these versions of externalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of the mind . </P> <P> Semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject . Hilary Putnam 's Twin Earth thought experiment is a good example . </P> <P> Cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment , of tools , of development , and of the body in fleshing out cognition . Embodied cognition , the extended mind , and enactivism are good examples . </P> <P> Phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body . Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich , Edwin Holt , Francois Tonneau , Kevin O'Regan , Riccardo Manzotti , Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans . </P> <H2> Naturalism and its problems ( edit ) </H2> <P> The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material ( or physical ) world . Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess . Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing . The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the `` naturalization of the mental '' . Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality . </P> <H3> Qualia ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Qualia <P> Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals . And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality , e.g. of pain , that it hurts . However , the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical , since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt . Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from . The existence of cerebral events , in and of themselves , can not explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences . The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain . </P> <P> Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences . This follows from an assumption about the possibility of reductive explanations . According to this view , if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively ( e.g. , water ) , then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties ( e.g. , fluidity , transparency ) . In the case of mental states , this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way . </P> <P> The 20th - century German philosopher Martin Heidegger criticized the ontological assumptions underpinning such a reductive model , and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms . This is because , according to Heidegger , the nature of our subjective experience and its qualities is impossible to understand in terms of Cartesian `` substances '' that bear `` properties '' . Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of -- or is semantically incommensurable with the concept of -- substances that bear properties . </P> <P> This problem of explaining introspective first - person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third - person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap . There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind . David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature ; that is , they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false . There are two separate categories involved and one can not be reduced to the other . An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn . According to them , the gap is epistemological in nature . For Nagel , science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required . We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently . For McGinn , on other hand , the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations . We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants . Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem . This semantic problem , of course , led to the famous `` Qualia Question '' , which is : Does Red cause Redness ? </P> <H3> Intentionality ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Intentionality John Searle -- one of the most influential philosophers of mind , proponent of biological naturalism ( Berkeley 2002 ) <P> Intentionality is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards ( about ) or be in relation with something in the external world . This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values . When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem : natural processes are not true or false , they simply happen . It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false . But mental ideas or judgments are true or false , so how then can mental states ( ideas or judgments ) be natural processes ? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts . Thus , for example , the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian . If the fact is true , then the idea is true ; otherwise , it is false . But where does this relation come from ? In the brain , there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus . </P> <H2> Philosophy of perception ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Philosophy of perception <P> Philosophy of perception is concerned with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects , in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world . The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include naive realism , enactivism and representional views . </P> <H2> Philosophy of mind and science ( edit ) </H2> <P> Humans are corporeal beings and , as such , they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences . Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes , the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind . There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental . The list of such sciences includes : biology , computer science , cognitive science , cybernetics , linguistics , medicine , pharmacology , and psychology . </P> <H3> Neurobiology ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Neuroscience <P> The theoretical background of biology , as is the case with modern natural sciences in general , is fundamentally materialistic . The objects of study are , in the first place , physical processes , which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior . The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition : `` there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states . '' </P> <P> Within the field of neurobiology , there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes : Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation . Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes . Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain . Lastly , evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and , in as much as this is the basis of the mind , also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages . Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind , as the gene - based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods . </P> Since the 1980s , sophisticated neuroimaging procedures , such as fMRI ( above ) , have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain , shedding light on ancient philosophical problems . <P> The methodological breakthroughs of the neurosciences , in particular the introduction of high - tech neuroimaging procedures , has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs : one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions ( see : neural correlate ) . Several groups are inspired by these advances . </P> <H3> Computer science ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Computer science <P> Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of information ( or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned ) by means of such things as computers . From the beginning , computer programmers have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind . A simple example is multiplication . It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind . Could they , someday , come to have what we call a mind ? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence ( AI ) . </P> <P> Within AI , it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one : this distinction was coined by John Searle in terms of a weak AI and strong AI . The exclusive objective of `` weak AI '' , according to Searle , is the successful simulation of mental states , with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware , etc . The objective of strong AI , on the contrary , is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings . The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation Alan Turing . As an answer to the question `` Can computers think ? '' , he formulated the famous Turing test . Turing believed that a computer could be said to `` think '' when , if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being , the computer 's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human . Essentially , Turing 's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind -- intelligence is as intelligence does . The Turing test has received many criticisms , among which the most famous is probably the Chinese room thought experiment formulated by Searle . </P> <P> The question about the possible sensitivity ( qualia ) of computers or robots still remains open . Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the `` mind -- body problem '' . They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers , it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ( wetware ) . </P> <H3> Psychology ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Psychology <P> Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly . It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy , fear or obsessions . Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism . </P> <P> An example of this is the psychology of perception . Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms . A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other . This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states . However , it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states . The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind -- body problem already described . </P> <H3> Cognitive science ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes . It examines what cognition is , what it does , and how it works . It includes research on intelligence and behavior , especially focusing on how information is represented , processed , and transformed ( in faculties such as perception , language , memory , reasoning , and emotion ) within nervous systems ( human or other animal ) and machines ( e.g. computers ) . Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines , including psychology , artificial intelligence , philosophy , neuroscience , linguistics , anthropology , sociology , and education . It spans many levels of analysis , from low - level learning and decision mechanisms to high - level logic and planning ; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation . Rowlands argues that cognition is enactive , embodied , embedded , affective and ( potentially ) extended . The position is taken that the `` classical sandwich '' of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial ; cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that can not be divided this way . </P> <H2> Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition ( edit ) </H2> <P> Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture , usually called analytic philosophy ( sometimes described as Anglo - American philosophy ) . Many other schools of thought exist , however , which are sometimes subsumed under the broad ( and vague ) label of continental philosophy . In any case , though topics and methods here are numerous , in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label ( phenomenology , existentialism , etc . ) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience . With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind , this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms . </P> <P> Immanuel Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason , first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787 , represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind . Kant 's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West . Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic / Anglo - American philosophy . Kant 's work develops an in - depth study of transcendental consciousness , or the life of the mind as conceived through universal categories of consciousness . </P> <P> In Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 's Philosophy of Mind ( frequently translated as Philosophy of Spirit or Geist ) , the third part of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences , Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind : the `` subjective mind / spirit '' , the mind of an individual ; the `` objective mind / spirit '' , the mind of society and of the State ; and the `` Absolute mind / spirit '' , the position of religion , art , and philosophy . See also Hegel 's The Phenomenology of Spirit . Nonetheless , Hegel 's work differs radically from the style of Anglo - American philosophy of mind . </P> <P> In 1896 , Henri Bergson made in Matter and Memory `` Essay on the relation of body and spirit '' a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory , thus allowing for a solution built on the empirical test case of aphasia . </P> <P> In modern times , the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism . Phenomenology , founded by Edmund Husserl , focuses on the contents of the human mind ( see noema ) and how processes shape our experiences . Existentialism , a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard , focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive . Existential - phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy ( they are not contradictory ) , rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger , Jean - Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau - Ponty . See Heidegger 's Being and Time , Merleau - Ponty 's Phenomenology of Perception , Sartre 's Being and Nothingness , and Simone de Beauvoir 's The Second Sex . </P> <H2> Mind in eastern philosophy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Mind in Hindu philosophy ( edit ) </H3> Dualism ( edit ) <P> Substance Dualism is a common feature of several orthodox Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya , Nyāya , Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta . In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul , which is eternal and undergoes samsara , a cycle of death and rebirth . The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material , and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self , the atman . Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha , liberation from the cycle of reincarnation . </P> Vedanta monistic idealism ( edit ) Śaṅkara <P> In the Advaita Vedanta of the 8th century Indian philosopher Śaṅkara , the mind , body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called Brahman . Advaita , which means non-dualism , holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute consciousness . The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion , or Maya . The only thing that exists is Brahman , which is described as Satchitananda ( Being , consciousness and bliss ) . Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states `` Brahman is alone True , and this world of plurality is an error ; the individual self is not different from Brahman . '' </P> <P> Another form of monistic Vedanta is Vishishtadvaita ( qualified non-dualism ) as posited by the eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja . Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always intentional and that it is also always a property of something . Ramanuja 's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity . This doctrine is called `` samanadhikaranya '' ( several things in a common substrate ) . </P> Materialism ( edit ) <P> Arguably the first exposition of empirical materialism in the history of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school ( also called Lokāyata ) . The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter ( which they defined as being made up of the four elements ) , including God and the soul . Therefore , they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms . A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath , but since this also was a form of matter , it was not said to survive death . </P> <H3> Buddhist philosophy of mind ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> The Five Aggregates ( pañca khandha ) according to the Pali Canon . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> form ( rūpa ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> 4 elements ( mahābhūta ) </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> ↓ </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""1""> </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> contact ( phassa ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> ↓ </Td> <Td_colspan=""2""> ↑ </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""4""> consciousness ( viññāna ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> → ← ← </Td> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> mental factors ( cetasika ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> feeling ( vedanā ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> perception ( sañña ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> formation ( saṅkhāra ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""3""> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Form is derived from the Four Great Elements . </Li> <Li> Consciousness arises from other aggregates . </Li> <Li> Mental Factors arise from the Contact of Consciousness and other aggregates . </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> Source : MN 109 ( Thanissaro , 2001 ) diagram details </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment - to - moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing . The moment - by - moment manifestation of the mind - stream has been described as happening in every person all the time , even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world , or analyses the material body including the organ brain . The manifestation of the mind - stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws , biological laws , psychological laws , volitional laws , and universal laws . </P> <P> A salient feature of Buddhist philosophy which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of not - self ( Pāli . anatta , Skt . anātman ) . The Buddha 's not - self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self . In this sense , what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction , an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors . The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent - arising ( pratītyasamutpāda ) . This means that all things , including mental events , arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions . This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind . </P> Abhidharma theories of mind ( edit ) <P> Three centuries after the death of the Buddha ( c. 150 BCE ) saw the growth of a large body of literature called the Abhidharma in several contending Buddhist schools . In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind , the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ( ' conceptual proliferation ' ) . According to this theory , perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations ( expectations , judgments and desires ) . This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena . In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena . Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities , five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena . The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception , awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or ' introspective awareness ' ( manovijñāna ) and attention ( āvartana ) , the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions . </P> <P> Rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how rebirth and karma continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind . This challenge was met by the Theravāda school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence . This `` life - stream '' ( Bhavanga - sota ) is an undercurrent forming the condition of being . The continuity of a karmic `` person '' is therefore assured in the form of a mindstream ( citta - santana ) , a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life - continuum mind ( Bhavanga - citta ) , mental content , and attention . </P> Indian Mahayana ( edit ) <P> The Sautrāntika school held a form of phenomenalism that saw the world as imperceptible . It held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition , which can only apprehend mental representations . This influenced the later Yogācāra school of Mahayana Buddhism . The Yogācāra school is often called the mind - only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality . The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism . Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities . Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu 's philosophy vary widely , and include phenomenalism , neutral monism and realist phenomenology . </P> <P> The Indian Mahayana schools were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness ( svasaṃvedana ) . Dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school , comparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects . This was strictly rejected by Mādhyamika scholars like Candrakīrti . Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness , they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self - validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness . These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker Śāntarakṣita . In Śāntarakṣita 's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine . Thus he states : `` By relying on the Mind - Only system , know that external entities do not exist . And by relying on this Middle Way system , know that no self exists at all , even in that ( mind ) . '' </P> <P> The Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the repository consciousness ( ālayavijñāna ) to explain continuity of mind in rebirth and accumulation of karma . This repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds ( bija ) when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of dharmic phenomena . Thus according to B. Alan Wallace : </P> <P> No constituents of the body -- in the brain or elsewhere -- transform into mental states and processes . Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body , but neither do they emerge from nothing . Rather , all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate , and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness . </P> Tibetan Buddhism ( edit ) <P> Tibetan Buddhist theories of mind evolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views . Thus the founder of the Gelug school , Je Tsongkhapa discusses the Yogācāra system of the Eight Consciousnesses in his Explanation of the Difficult Points . He would later come to repudiate Śāntarakṣita 's pragmatic idealism . According to the 14th Dalai Lama the mind can be defined `` as an entity that has the nature of mere experience , that is , ' clarity and knowing ' . It is the knowing nature , or agency , that is called mind , and this is non-material . '' The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> 1 . Clarity ( gsal ) -- The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena ( snang - ba ) . </Dd> <Dd> 2 . Knowing ( rig ) -- The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> The 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as experiential dualism which is described above under the different types of dualism . </P> <P> Because Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately soteriological , it focuses on meditative practices such as Dzogchen and Mahamudra that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly . This unobstructed knowledge of one 's primordial , empty and non-dual Buddha nature is called rigpa . The mind 's innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or `` clear light '' ( ' od gsal ) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror . Sogyal Rinpoche speaks of mind thus : `` Imagine a sky , empty , spacious , and pure from the beginning ; its essence is like this . Imagine a sun , luminous , clear , unobstructed , and spontaneously present ; its nature is like this . '' </P> Zen Buddhism ( edit ) <P> The central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind . Chinese Chan master Huangpo described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts . The pure Buddha - mind is thus able to see things `` as they truly are '' , as absolute and non-dual `` thusness '' ( Tathatā ) . This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind , as well as no difference between samsara and nirvana . </P> <P> In the Shobogenzo , the Japanese philosopher Dogen argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called shin jin ( bodymind ) . According to Dogen , `` casting off body and mind '' ( Shinjin datsuraku ) in zazen will allow one to experience things - as - they - are ( genjokoan ) which is the nature of original enlightenment ( hongaku ) . </P> <H2> Topics related to philosophy of mind ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind . Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character , the nature of emotion , of perception and of memory . Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind . There are two subjects that , in connection with the philosophy of the mind , have aroused special attention : free will and the self . </P> <H3> Free will ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Free will <P> In the context of philosophy of mind , the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity . This is certainly the case , at least , for materialistic determinists . According to this position , natural laws completely determine the course of the material world . Mental states , and therefore the will as well , would be material states , which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws . Some take this reasoning a step further : people can not determine by themselves what they want and what they do . Consequently , they are not free . </P> <P> This argumentation is rejected , on the one hand , by the compatibilists . Those who adopt this position suggest that the question `` Are we free ? '' can only be answered once we have determined what the term `` free '' means . The opposite of `` free '' is not `` caused '' but `` compelled '' or `` coerced '' . It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination . A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise . In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true . The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was David Hume . More recently , this position is defended , for example , by Daniel Dennett . </P> <P> On the other hand , there are also many incompatibilists who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism . These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a ) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency , b ) determined by indeterministic natural law only , or c ) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency . Under Libertarianism , the will does not have to be deterministic and , therefore , it is potentially free . Critics of the second proposition ( b ) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom . They argue as follows : if our will is not determined by anything , then we desire what we desire by pure chance . And if what we desire is purely accidental , we are not free . So if our will is not determined by anything , we are not free . </P> <H3> Self ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Philosophy of self <P> The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of `` self '' . If by `` self '' or `` I '' one refers to an essential , immutable nucleus of the person , some modern philosophers of mind , such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists . According to Dennett and other contemporaries , the self is considered an illusion . The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an immaterial soul . Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of `` self '' as postulated by David Hume , who could never catch himself not doing , thinking or feeling anything . However , in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology , developmental biology and neuroscience , the idea of an essential inconstant , material nucleus -- an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections -- seems reasonable . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Animal consciousness </Li> <Li> Artificial consciousness </Li> <Li> Collective intentionality </Li> <Li> Outline of human intelligence </Li> <Li> Outline of thought </Li> <Li> Theory of mind in animals </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Oliver Elbs , Neuro - Esthetics : Mapological foundations and applications ( Map 2003 ) , ( Munich 2005 ) </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kim , J.

Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as one of the greatest players of all time , Ronaldo has a record - tying five Ballon d'Or awards , the most for a European player , and is the first player to win four European Golden Shoes . He has won 26 trophies in his career , including five league titles , five UEFA Champions League titles and one UEFA European Championship . A prolific goalscorer , Ronaldo holds the records for most official goals scored in Europe 's top - five leagues ( 395 ) , the UEFA Champions League ( 120 ) , the UEFA European Championship ( 9 ) , as well as those for most assists in the UEFA Champions League ( 34 ) and the UEFA European Championship ( 6 ) . He has scored over 670 senior career goals for club and country . </P> <P> Born and raised on the Portuguese island of Madeira , Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart at age 15 . He underwent an operation to treat his condition , and began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP , before signing with Manchester United at age 18 in 2003 . After winning his first trophy , the FA Cup , during his first season in England , he helped United win three successive Premier League titles , a UEFA Champions League title , and a FIFA Club World Cup . By age 22 , he had received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations and at age 23 , he won his first Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards . In 2009 , Ronaldo was the subject of the most expensive association football transfer when he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer worth € 94 million ( £ 80 million ) . </P> <P> In Madrid , Ronaldo won 15 trophies , including two La Liga titles , two Copas del Rey , four UEFA Champions League titles , two UEFA Super Cups , and three FIFA Club World Cups. Real Madrid 's all - time top goalscorer , Ronaldo scored a record 34 La Liga hat - tricks , including a record - tying eight hat - tricks in the 2014 -- 15 season and is the only player to reach 30 goals in six consecutive La Liga seasons . After joining Madrid , Ronaldo finished runner - up for the Ballon d'Or three times , behind Lionel Messi , his perceived career rival , before winning back - to - back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014 . After winning the 2016 and 2017 Champions Leagues , Ronaldo secured back - to - back Ballons d'Or again in 2016 and 2017 . A historic third consecutive Champions League followed , making Ronaldo the first player to win the trophy five times . In 2018 , he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth € 100 million , the highest fee ever paid for a player over 30 years old , and the highest ever paid by an Italian club . </P> <P> A Portuguese international , Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation in 2015 . He made his senior debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18 , and has since had over 150 caps , including appearing and scoring in eight major tournaments , becoming Portugal 's most capped player and his country 's all - time top goalscorer . He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 and helped Portugal reach the final . He took over full captaincy in July 2008 , leading Portugal to their first - ever triumph in a major tournament by winning Euro 2016 , and received the Silver Boot as the second - highest goalscorer of the tournament , before becoming the highest European international goalscorer of all - time . One of the most marketable athletes in the world , he was ranked the world 's highest - paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 , as well as the world 's most famous athlete by ESPN in 2016 , 2017 and 2018 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Club career <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Sporting CP </Li> <Li> 2.2 Manchester United <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 2003 -- 07 : Development and breakthrough </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 2007 -- 09 : Collective and individual success </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.3 Real Madrid <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 2009 -- 13 : World record transfer and La Liga championship </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 2013 -- 15 : Consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins and La Décima </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 2015 -- 17 : All - time Real Madrid top scorer and La Undécima </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 2017 -- 18 : A record fifth Champions League title and fifth Ballon d'Or </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.4 Juventus <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 2018 -- 19 </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 International career <Ul> <Li> 3.1 2001 -- 07 : Youth level and early international career </Li> <Li> 3.2 2007 -- 12 : Assuming the captaincy </Li> <Li> 3.3 2012 -- 16 : All - time Portugal top scorer and European champion </Li> <Li> 3.4 2016 -- present : Post-European Championship victory , and World Cup </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Player profile <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Style of play </Li> <Li> 4.2 Reception </Li> <Li> 4.3 Comparisons to Lionel Messi </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Outside football </Li> <Li> 6 Personal life <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Family and relationships </Li> <Li> 6.2 Philanthropy </Li> <Li> 6.3 Controversies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Career statistics <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Club </Li> <Li> 7.2 International </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Honours and achievements <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Club </Li> <Li> 8.2 International </Li> <Li> 8.3 Individual <Ul> <Li> 8.3. 1 Awards </Li> <Li> 8.3. 2 Performances </Li> <Li> 8.3. 3 Orders </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8.4 Records <Ul> <Li> 8.4. 1 World </Li> <Li> 8.4. 2 Continental </Li> <Li> 8.4. 3 Spain </Li> <Li> 8.4. 4 Portugal </Li> <Li> 8.4. 5 Real Madrid </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Further reading </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early life </H2> <P> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro , Funchal , Portugal and grew up in the Funchal parish of Santo António , as the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro , a cook , and José Dinis Aveiro , a municipal gardener and a part - time kit man . His second given name , `` Ronaldo '' , was chosen after then - U.S. president Ronald Reagan . He has one older brother , Hugo , and two older sisters , Elma and Liliana Cátia . His great - grandmother on his father 's side , Isabel da Piedade , was from São Vicente , Cape Verde . Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home , sharing a room with his brother and sisters . </P> <P> As a child , Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha from 1992 to 1995 , where his father was the kit man , and later spent two years with Nacional . In 1997 , aged 12 , he went on a three - day trial with Sporting CP , who signed him for a fee of £ 1,500 . He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete , near Lisbon , to join Sporting 's other youth players at the club 's football academy . By age 14 , Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally , and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football . While popular with other students at school , he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher , who he said had `` disrespected '' him . However , one year later , he was diagnosed with a racing heart , a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football . Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways , altering his resting heart rate . He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later . </P> <H2> Club career </H2> <H3> Sporting CP </H3> Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP 's museum <P> At age 16 , Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting 's youth team by first - team manager László Bölöni , who was impressed with his dribbling . He subsequently became the first player to play for the club 's under - 16 , under - 17 and under - 18 teams , the B team , and the first team , all within a single season . A year later , on 7 October 2002 , Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga , against Moreirense , and scored two goals in their 3 -- 0 win . Over the course of the 2002 -- 03 season , his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta . Manager Arsène Wenger , who was interested in signing the winger , met with him at Arsenal 's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer . </P> <P> Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson , however , determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently , after Sporting defeated United 3 -- 1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003 . Initially , United had just planned to sign Ronaldo and then loan him back to Sporting for a year . Having impressed the Manchester United players , however , they urged Ferguson to sign him . After the game , Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £ 12.24 million for what he considered to be `` one of the most exciting young players '' he had ever seen . A decade after his departure from the club , in April 2013 , Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000 th member . </P> <H3> Manchester United </H3> 2003 -- 07 : development and breakthrough <P> Ronaldo became Manchester United 's first - ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003 -- 04 season . His transfer fee of £ 12.24 million made him , at the time , the most expensive teenager in English football history . Although he requested the number 28 , his number at Sporting , he received the number 7 shirt , which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best , Eric Cantona and David Beckham . Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo . A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager , Alex Ferguson , of whom he later said , `` He 's been my father in sport , one of the most important and influential factors in my career . '' </P> <P> Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4 -- 0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003 , receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th - minute substitute for Nicky Butt . His performance earned praise from George Best , who hailed it as `` undoubtedly the most exciting debut '' he had ever seen . Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free - kick in a 3 -- 0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November . Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign , the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season , a match in which he also received his first red card . Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United 's 3 -- 0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final , earning his first trophy . </P> Ronaldo playing against Chelsea in the Premier League during his third season in England <P> At the start of 2005 , Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004 -- 05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal . He played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against Arsenal in the FA Cup final , which ended in a goalless draw , and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout . He scored Manchester United 's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October , their only strike in a 4 -- 1 loss to Middlesbrough . Midway through the season , in November , he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010 . Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football , the Football League Cup , after scoring the third goal in United 's 4 -- 0 final victory over Wigan Athletic . </P> <P> During his third season in England , Ronaldo was involved in several incidents . He had a one - match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a `` one - fingered gesture '' towards Benfica fans , and was sent off in the Manchester derby -- a 3 -- 1 defeat -- for kicking Manchester City 's former United player Andy Cole . Ronaldo clashed with a teammate , striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who took offence at the winger 's showboating style of play . Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup , in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off , Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer , lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident . United , however , denied the possibility of him leaving the club . </P> <P> Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006 -- 07 season , it proved to be his breakout year , as he broke the 20 - goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title . An important factor in this success was his one - to - one training by first - team coach René Meulensteen , who taught him to make himself more unpredictable , improve his teamwork , call for the ball , and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known . He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December , against Aston Villa -- a victory which put United on top of the league -- Wigan Athletic , and Reading . Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December , becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours . </P> 2007 -- 09 : collective and individual success Ronaldo during the 2006 -- 07 season <P> At the quarter - final stage of the 2006 -- 07 UEFA Champions League , Ronaldo scored his first - ever goals in the competition , finding the net twice in a 7 -- 1 victory over Roma . He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan , which ended in a 3 -- 2 win , but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3 -- 0 at the San Siro . He also helped United reach the FA Cup final , but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1 -- 0 defeat . Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007 -- his 50th goal for the club -- as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years . As a result of his performances , he amassed a host of personal awards for the season . He won the Professional Footballers ' Association 's Player 's Player , Fans ' Player , and Young Player of the Year awards , as well as the Football Writers ' Association 's Footballer of the Year award , becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours . His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £ 120,000 a week ( £ 31 million total ) as part of a five - year contract extension with United . </P> <P> Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007 -- 08 season , his most prolific campaign during his time in England . He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season , an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him . At the end of 2007 , Ronaldo was named runner - up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or , and came third , behind Kaká and Lionel Messi , in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award . </P> <P> Ronaldo scored his first and only hat - trick for Manchester United in a 6 -- 0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008 , bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table . A month later , on 19 March , he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton , and scored both goals of the match . His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign , which bettered George Best 's total of 32 goals in the 1967 -- 68 season , thus setting the club 's new single - season record by a midfielder . His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot , as well as the European Golden Shoe , which made him the first winger to win the latter award . </P> Ronaldo taking a direct free kick against Celtic in the 2008 -- 09 UEFA Champions League <P> In the knockout stage of the Champions League , Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon , which helped United advance to the quarter - finals 2 -- 1 on aggregate , and , while playing as a striker , scored with a header in the 3 -- 0 aggregate victory over Roma . United advanced to the final against Chelsea in Moscow , where , despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty being saved in the shoot - out , Manchester United emerged victorious . As the Champions League top scorer , Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year . He additionally received the PFA Players ' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season . </P> <P> As rumours circulated of Ronaldo 's interest in moving to Real Madrid , United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid 's alleged pursuit of their player , but they declined to take action . FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club , describing the situation as `` modern slavery '' . Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter , he remained at United for another year . Ahead of the 2008 -- 09 season , on 7 July , he underwent ankle surgery , which kept him out of action for 10 weeks . Following his return , he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5 -- 0 win against Stoke City on 15 November , which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time . At the close of 2008 , Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan , assisting the final - winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process . He subsequently became United 's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968 , and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year . </P> <P> His match - winning goal in the second leg against Porto , a 40 - yard strike , earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award , presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year ; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored . United advanced to the final in Rome , where he made little impact in United 's 2 -- 0 defeat to Barcelona . Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies , as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a Football League Cup . He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions , 16 goals fewer than the previous season , in four more appearances . His final ever goal for Manchester United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford . </P> <H3> Real Madrid </H3> 2009 -- 13 : World record transfer and La Liga Championship <P> Ahead of the 2009 -- 10 season , Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time , of £ 80 million ( € 94 million ) . His contract , which ran until 2015 , was worth € 11 million per year and contained a € 1 billion buy - out clause . At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu , surpassing the 25 - year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli . Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 , the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United , Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt , which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano . </P> As his usual number 7 was unavailable , Ronaldo wore number 9 during his first season at Madrid . Following Raúl 's departure , Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010 -- 11 season . <P> Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009 , against Deportivo La Coruña , and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid 's 3 -- 2 home win . He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club , the first Madrid player to do so . His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich . His strong start to the season , however , was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty , which kept him sidelined for seven weeks . A week after his return , he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería . Midway through the season , Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award , behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona , Madrid 's historic rivals . He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions , including a hat - trick in a 4 -- 1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010 , his first in the Spanish competition . His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless . </P> <P> Following Raúl 's departure , Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010 -- 11 season . His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or - winning form was epitomised when , for the first time in his career , he scored four goals in a single match during a 6 -- 1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October . His haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches -- three in La Liga , one in the Champions League , and two for Portugal -- totalling 11 goals , the most he had scored in a single month . Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat - tricks against Athletic Bilbao , Levante , Villarreal , and Málaga . Despite his performance , he failed to make the podium for the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or at the end of 2010 . </P> <P> During a historical series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011 , Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season . Although he failed to find the net during Madrid 's eventual elimination in the Champions League semi-finals , he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match - winning goal in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final , winning his first trophy in Spain . Over the next two weeks , Ronaldo scored another four - goal haul against Sevilla , a hat - trick against Getafe , and a brace of free kicks against Villarreal , taking his league total to 38 goals , which equalled the record for most goals scored in a season held by Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez . His two goals in the last match of the season , against Almería , made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals . In addition to the Pichichi Trophy , Ronaldo consequently won the European Golden Shoe for a second time , becoming the first player to win the award in two different leagues . He ended his second season at Real Madrid with a total of 53 goals in all competitions . </P> Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain . <P> During the following campaign , the 2011 -- 12 season , Ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions . His 100th goal for Real Madrid came at Camp Nou in the Supercopa de España , though Barcelona claimed the trophy 5 -- 4 on aggregate . He regained a place on the FIFA Ballon d'Or podium , as runner - up to Messi , after scoring hat - tricks against Real Zaragoza , Rayo Vallecano , Málaga , Osasuna , and Sevilla , the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season 's midway point . Despite two goals from Ronaldo , Madrid were subsequently defeated by Barcelona 4 -- 3 on aggregrate in the quarter - finals of the Copa del Rey . He again scored twice , including a penalty , in the Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich , resulting in a 3 -- 3 draw , but his penalty kick in the shootout was saved by Manuel Neuer , leading to Madrid 's elimination . </P> <P> Ronaldo found greater team success in the league , as he helped Real Madrid win their first La Liga title in four years , with a record 100 points . Following a hat - trick against Levante , further increasing Madrid 's lead over Barcelona , he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5 -- 1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012 , a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons , breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás . Another hat - trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals , equalling his record of the previous season . His final league goal of the campaign , against Mallorca , took his total to 46 goals , four short of the new record set by Messi , and earned him the distinction of being the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season in La Liga . </P> <P> Ronaldo began the 2012 -- 13 season by lifting the Supercopa de España , his third trophy in Spain . With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese , Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4 -- 4 aggregate draw against Barcelona . Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a `` professional issue '' within the club , prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid , his goalscoring rate did not suffer . After netting a hat - trick , including two penalties , against Deportivo La Coruña , he scored his first hat - trick in the Champions League in a 4 -- 1 victory over Ajax . Four days later , he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2 -- 2 draw at Camp Nou . His performances in 2012 again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the FIFA Ballon d'Or , finishing runner - up to four - time winner Messi . </P> 2013 -- 15 : consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins and La Décima <P> Following the 2012 -- 13 winter break , Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the first time in an official match , scoring a brace to lift 10 - man Madrid to a 4 -- 3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January . He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January , a match which also marked his 500th club appearance . Three days prior , he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat - trick against Getafe . Following hat - tricks against Celta Vigo and Sevilla , he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid on 8 May in a 6 -- 2 win against Málaga , reaching the landmark in 197 games . He helped Madrid reach the Copa del Rey final by scoring a brace in El Clásico , which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored , a Real Madrid record . In the final , he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2 -- 1 defeat to Atlético Madrid , but was shown a straight red card in the 114th minute for violent conduct . Real Madrid also failed to defend their La Liga title , finishing runners up to Barcelona . </P> <P> In the first knockout round of the Champions League , Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time . After scoring the equaliser in a 1 -- 1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu , he scored the match - winning goal in a 2 -- 1 victory at Old Trafford , his first return to his former home ground . Ronaldo scored three goals in Madrid 's 5 -- 3 aggregate victory over Galatasaray to see them advance to the semi-finals , He scored Madrid 's only goal in the 4 -- 1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund , but failed to increase his side 's 2 -- 0 victory in the second leg , as they were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year . Ronaldo had scored 12 goals , finishing as the Champions League top goalscorer for a second time in his career . Accounting for all competitions , he ended the season with a total of 55 goals . </P> Ronaldo scored a record 17 goals during the 2013 -- 14 La Décima campaign . <P> Real Madrid 's failure to win major silverware and reports of division among the players prompted speculation regarding Ronaldo 's future at the club . At the start of the 2013 -- 14 season , however , he signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018 , with a salary of € 17 million net , making him briefly the highest - paid player in football . He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale , whose world record transfer fee of € 100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior . Together with striker Karim Benzema , they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed `` BBC '' , an acronym of Bale , Benzema , and Cristiano , and a play off the name of the public service broadcaster . After enjoying a strong goalscoring run during the first half of the campaign , Ronaldo suggested that he was in the best form of his career . By late November , he had scored 32 goals from 22 matches played for both club and country , including hat - tricks against Galatasaray , Sevilla , Real Sociedad , Northern Ireland , and Sweden . He ended 2013 with a total of 69 goals in 59 appearances , his highest year - end goal tally . His efforts earned him the FIFA Ballon d'Or , an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award , for the first time in his career . </P> <P> Concurrently with his individual achievements , Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date , as he helped Real Madrid win La Décima , their tenth European Cup . In the knockout phase of the competition , he scored a brace in each leg of a 9 -- 2 aggregate win against Schalke 04 , helping Madrid advance to the quarter - finals . His goal in a 3 -- 0 home win over Borussia Dortmund -- his 100th Champions League match -- took his total for the season to 14 goals , equalling the record Messi had set two years before . After hitting a brace in a 4 -- 0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena , he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4 -- 1 final victory over Atlético Madrid , becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams . His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems , which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign . Ronaldo played the final against medical advice , later commenting : `` In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks . '' As the Champions League top goalscorer for the third time , with a record 17 goals , he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe . </P> <P> In the Copa del Rey , Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring a brace of penalties against Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón , the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90 - minute football match . His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final , where Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2 -- 1 to claim the trophy . While Madrid were less successful in La Liga , finishing third , Ronaldo was unmatched as a goalscorer . He scored 31 goals in 30 league games , which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe , receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez . Among his haul was his 400th career goal , in 653 appearances for club and country , which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January ; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio , who had died two days before . A last - minute , backheeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May -- his 50th goal in all competitions -- was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional , which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga . </P> <P> During the next campaign , the 2014 -- 15 season , Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals in all competitions , starting with both goals in Real Madrid 's 2 -- 0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup . He subsequently achieved his best - ever goalscoring start to a league campaign , with a record 15 goals in the first eight rounds of La Liga , including a four - goal haul against Elche and hat - tricks against Deportivo La Coruña and Athletic Bilbao . His record 23rd hat - trick in La Liga , scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December , made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in the Spanish league , as he reached the milestone in only his 178th game . After lifting the FIFA Club World Cup with Madrid in Morocco , again winning the Silver Ball , Ronaldo received a second successive FIFA Ballon d'Or , joining Johan Cruyff , Michel Platini , and Marco van Basten as a three - time Ballon d'Or winner . </P> 2015 -- 17 : all - time Real Madrid top scorer and La Undécima Ronaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions during the 2014 -- 15 season . <P> Following the winter break , Ronaldo 's form faltered , concurrently with a decline in performance by his team . A 2 -- 1 defeat against Valencia in the first match of 2015 , despite his opening goal , ended Real Madrid 's Spanish record winning streak of 22 matches in all competitions . Their season continued unsuccessfully as they failed to win a major trophy , earning a second - place league finish and a semi-final exit in Europe . In the latter competition , Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2 -- 0 win against Schalke 04 , before hitting a brace in the 3 -- 4 return defeat that allowed Madrid to progress to the quarter - finals . He then scored both of his side 's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus , where Madrid were eliminated 2 -- 3 on aggregate . With 10 goals , he finished the campaign as top scorer for a third consecutive season , alongside Messi and Neymar . </P> <P> In La Liga , where Madrid finished second , Ronaldo went on a prolific goalscoring run towards the very end of the season . For the first time in his career , he scored five goals in one game , including an eight - minute hat - trick , in a 9 -- 1 rout of Granada on 5 April . His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2 -- 0 win against Rayo Vallecano . Subsequent hat - tricks against Sevilla , Espanyol , and Getafe took his number of hat - tricks for Real Madrid to 31 , surpassing Di Stéfano 's club record of 28 trebles . As a result , Ronaldo finished the season with 48 goals , two ahead of his total in the 2011 -- 12 season , despite having missed two matches in February for assaulting a Córdoba player . In addition to a second consecutive Pichichi , he won the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time . </P> <P> At the start of his seventh season at Real Madrid , the 2015 -- 16 campaign , Ronaldo became the club 's all - time top scorer , first in the league and then in all competitions . His five - goal haul in a 6 -- 0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games , surpassing the club 's previous recordholder , Raúl . A month later , on 17 October , he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3 -- 0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals . Ronaldo also became the all - time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat - trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk , having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals . A brace against Malmö FF , scoring in a 2 -- 0 away win on 30 September , saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for both club and country . He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition 's group stage , setting the record at 11 goals , including another four - goal haul against Malmö . </P> By March 2016 , Ronaldo had scored 252 goals in 228 matches in La Liga to become the competition 's second - highest scorer . <P> Despite finishing runner - up to Messi for the FIFA Ballon d'Or , Ronaldo received criticism for his form and performances against top teams , with 14 of his goals coming against Espanyol and Malmö . However , during the second half of the season , his form gradually improved . By scoring four goals in a 7 -- 1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 , Ronaldo arrived at 252 goals in La Liga to become the competition 's second - highest scorer in history behind Messi . After netting the match - winning goal for 10 - man Madrid in a 2 -- 1 Clásico victory on 2 April , he scored a hat - trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals despite a 2 -- 0 first - leg defeat . The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals , making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season , and the fifth overall . Suffering apparent fitness issues , Ronaldo gave a poorly - received performance in the final against Atlético Madrid , in a repeat of the 2014 final , though his penalty in the subsequent shoot - out secured La Undécima , Madrid 's 11th victory . For the sixth successive year , he ended the season having scored more than 50 goals across all competitions . For his efforts during the season , he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time . </P> <P> Ronaldo missed Real Madrid 's first three matches of the 2016 -- 17 season , including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla , as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the final of Euro 2016 . On 6 November , Ronaldo signed a new contract set to keep him with Madrid until 2021 . On 19 November , he scored a hat - trick in a 3 -- 0 away win against Atlético Madrid , making him the all - time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals .

Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named the best player of the tournament . He won the Ballon d'Or for a fourth time and the inaugural Best FIFA Men 's Player , a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year , largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016 . </P> 2017 -- 18 : a record fifth Champions League title and fifth Ballon d'Or Ronaldo with then President of the Community of Madrid , Cristina Cifuentes , during the title celebrations in Madrid <P> In Real Madrid 's 3 -- 2 away win against Villarreal on 27 February 2017 , Ronaldo overtook Hugo Sánchez as the most prolific penalty - kick scorer in La Liga history . As a result of the penalty scored by Ronaldo , Real Madrid reached its 5,900 th goal in the history of the league and became the first team to do so . On 12 April , in the 2016 -- 17 UEFA Champions League quarter - final against Bayern Munich , Ronaldo scored two goals in a 2 -- 1 away win to give Madrid the win and the lead going into the second leg . The two goals saw him make history in becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition . During the second leg of the quarter - finals , Ronaldo scored a perfect hat - trick and reached his 100th UEFA Champions League goal , becoming the first player to do so as Real Madrid again defeated Bayern 4 -- 2 after extra-time . On 2 May , Ronaldo scored another hat - trick in the following Champions League match , as Real Madrid defeated Atlético Madrid 3 -- 0 in the semi-final first leg . His hat - trick made him the first player to reach 50 goals in the knockout stage of the competition . </P> <P> On 17 May , Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all - time top scorer in the top five European leagues , scoring a brace against Celta de Vigo . He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012 and the first team to win back - to - back finals in the Champions League era ; the first to win consecutive European titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990 , when the tournament was known as the European Cup . In the 2017 final , he scored two goals in the victory against Juventus and became the top goalscorer for the fifth - straight season , and sixth overall , with 12 goals , while also becoming the first person to score in three finals in the Champions League era as well as reaching his 600th senior career goal . Real Madrid 's title was its 12th , also known as La Duodécima , extending its record , and its third in four years . </P> <P> At the start of the 2017 -- 18 season , Ronaldo scored Madrid 's second goal in a 3 -- 1 Supercopa de España first - leg victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou . Having received a yellow card for taking his shirt off during his goal celebration , he was sent off for a second yellow card offence minutes later before he shoved the referee lightly to depict his dissatisfaction . He was issued a five - match suspension following the match . In his 400th game for Real Madrid , Ronaldo scored two goals away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League , taking his club tally to 411 goals . On 23 October , his performances in the first half of 2017 saw him claim his fifth FIFA Player of the Year award by receiving The Best FIFA Men 's Player award for the second consecutive year .

He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season , ending the campaign with 15 goals . After the final , Ronaldo referred to his time with the Champions League winners in the past tense , sparking speculation that he could leave Real Madrid . </P> <H3> Juventus </H3> 2018 -- 19 <P> After a week of transfer speculation , on 10 July 2018 , Ronaldo signed a four - year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a € 100 million transfer , plus solidarity contributions to Ronaldo 's youth clubs and an additional € 12 million in other fees . The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old , and the highest ever paid by an Italian club . Upon signing , Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Real Madrid . Ronaldo made his official debut for Juventus in their opening Serie A match on 18 August , a 3 -- 2 away win over Chievo . </P> <H2> International career </H2> <H3> 2001 -- 07 : youth level and early international career </H3> <P> Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal at the 2001 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival , debuting in a 3 -- 1 defeat to Finland . The following year he would represent his country under - 17 side at the 2002 UEFA European Under - 17 Football Championship , where they failed to progress past the group stage . Ronaldo also featured in the Olympic squad at the 2004 Summer Olympics , scoring one goal in the tournament , though the team was eliminated in the first round , finishing bottom of their group with three points after 4 -- 2 defeats to eventual semi-finalists Iraq and quarter - finalists Costa Rica . During his international youth career , Ronaldo would go on to represent the under - 15 team , under - 17 , under - 20 , under - 21 , and under - 23 national sides , amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall . </P> <P> At age 18 , Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1 -- 0 victory over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003 .

After converting his penalty in a shootout against England at the quarter - final stage , he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2 -- 1 win over the Netherlands , but the crucial last match ended in a 0 -- 1 defeat . He was featured in the team of the tournament , having provided two assists in addition to his two goals . </P> <P> Ronaldo was the second - highest scorer in the European qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals . During the tournament , he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal 's second match of the group stage . In the quarter - finals against England , his Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho . Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney 's infraction , the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining , after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal 's bench following Rooney 's dismissal . Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the penalty shoot out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals . Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1 -- 0 semi-final defeat to France . FIFA 's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament 's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany 's Lukas Podolski , citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision . Following the 2006 World Cup , Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008 , scoring two goals in the process . </P> <H3> 2007 -- 12 : assuming the captaincy </H3> Ronaldo , pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012 , was made captain in 2008 . <P> One day after his 22nd birthday , Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007 , as requested by Portuguese Football Federation president Carlos Silva , who had died two days earlier . Ahead of Euro 2008 , he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time . While he scored eight goals in the qualification , the second - highest tally , he scored just one goal in the tournament , netting the second goal of their 3 -- 1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic ; in the same game , he also set - up Portugal 's third goal in injury time , which was scored by Quaresma , and was named man of the match for his performance . Portugal were eliminated in the quarter - finals with a 3 -- 2 loss against eventual finalists Germany . </P> <P> After Portugal 's unsuccessful performance in the European Championship , Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz , formerly the assistant manager at United . Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad 's permanent captain in July 2008 . Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup , as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play - off victory over Bosnia . At the group stage of the World Cup , he was named man of the match in all three matches against Côte d'Ivoire , North Korea , and Brazil . His only goal of the tournament came in their 7 -- 0 rout of North Korea , which marked his first international goal in 16 months . Portugal 's World Cup ended with a 1 -- 0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16 . </P> <P> Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012 , including two strikes against Bosnia in the play - offs , to send Portugal into the tournament , where they were drawn in a `` group of death '' . After the opening 0 -- 1 defeat to Germany , he also failed to score in the 3 -- 2 win against Denmark , missing two clear one - on - one chances . In the last group stage game against the Netherlands , Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2 -- 1 victory . He scored a header in the quarter - finals against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1 -- 0 win . In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match . After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless , with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar , Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shootout . Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth , a decision that drew criticism .

A qualifying match on 17 October 2012 , a 1 -- 1 draw against Northern Ireland , earned him his 100th cap . His first international hat - trick also came against Northern Ireland , when he found the net three times in a 15 - minute spell of a 4 -- 2 qualifying victory on 6 September 2013 . After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign , Ronaldo scored all four of the team 's goals in the play - offs against Sweden , which ensured their place at the tournament .

Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5 -- 1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country 's all - time top scorer . </P> <P> Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury , potentially risking his career . Ronaldo later commented : `` If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable . But we do n't . '' Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness , being forced to abort practice twice , Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany , though he was unable to prevent a 4 -- 0 defeat . After assisting an injury - time 2 -- 2 equaliser against the United States , he scored a late match - winning goal in a 2 -- 1 victory over Ghana .

At the start of the tournament , however , Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal 's draws against Iceland and Austria , despite taking a total of 20 shots on goal . In the latter match , he overtook Luís Figo as his nation 's most capped player with his 128th international appearance , which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half . With two goals and an assist in the last match of the group stage , a 3 -- 3 draw against Hungary , Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships , having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament . Though placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland , his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition 's newly expanded format . </P> <P> In Portugal 's first knockout match , Ronaldo 's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia 's goalkeeper into the path of Ricardo Quaresma , whose finish then secured a 1 -- 0 victory late in extra time . After his team progressed past Poland on penalties , Ronaldo became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals ; he scored the opening goal and assisted a second in a 2 -- 0 win against Wales , equaling Michel Platini as the competition 's all - time top scorer with nine goals . In the final against hosts France , Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet . After multiple treatments and attempts to play on , he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma . During extra time , substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1 -- 0 victory . As team captain , Ronaldo later lifted the trophy in celebration of his country 's first - ever triumph in a major tournament .

His four goals against a nine - man team marked the highest number of goals he has scored in an international match . On 13 November , Ronaldo scored two goals ( while also missing a penalty ) in another qualifier against Latvia , which ended in a 4 -- 1 home victory . These goals brought his international tally to 68 goals , putting level with Gerd Müller and Robbie Keane as the fourth - highest European international goalscorer of all - time .

He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal 's group stage matches . Ronaldo left the competition early : after Chile defeated Portugal 3 -- 0 on penalties in the semi-finals , he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children . Therefore , he missed Portugal 's third - place play - off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2 -- 1 after extra time . </P> <P> On 31 August 2017 , Ronaldo scored a hat - trick in a 5 -- 1 win in a World Cup qualifier over the Faroe Islands , which saw him overtake Pelé and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint - fifth - highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals .

On 30 June , Portugal were eliminated following a 2 -- 1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16 . </P> <H2> Player Profile </H2> <H3> Style of play </H3> Ronaldo in action for Real Madrid against Espanyol during the 2012 -- 13 season <P> A versatile attacker , Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch , and , while ostensibly right - footed , is very strong with both feet . He ranks among the world 's fastest footballers , both with and without the ball . Tactically , Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career . While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United , he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield , where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area . In this position , he was able to use his pace and acceleration , agility , and technical skills to take on opponents in one - on - one situations . Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair , often displaying an array of tricks and feints , such as the step overs that became his trademark . </P> Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010 -- 11 La Liga game against Almería <P> As Ronaldo matured , he underwent a major physical transformation , developing a muscular body type that allows him to retain possession of the ball . His strength , combined with his elevation and height of 1.85 m ( 6 ft 1 in ) , gives him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls . These attributes allow him to function as a target - man , and makes him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area ; consequently , many of his goals have been headers . Allied with his increased stamina and work - rate , his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks . He also increasingly played a creative role for his team , often dropping deep to pick up the ball , participate in the build - up of plays , and create chances for his teammates , courtesy of his good vision and passing ability . </P> Pictured during El Clásico in 2011 , Ronaldo in his familiar pose before striking a free kick <P> In his final seasons at United , Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role , functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward , or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion . He developed into a prolific goalscorer , capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot , courtesy of his striking ability . An accurate penalty kick taker , he also became a set piece specialist , renowned for his powerful , bending free kicks , though his ability in this regard deteriorated later on in his career . </P> <P> At Real Madrid , Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role , while his creative and defensive duties became more limited , although not entirely diminished . Initially deployed as a centre forward , he was later moved back onto the left wing , though in a free tactical role ; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score , or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit . Madrid 's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player , as evidenced by his record - breaking goalscoring feats . However , while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring , he also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role . From 2013 onwards , he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off - the - ball movement and general involvement , completing fewer dribbles and passes per game , and instead focusing on short - distance creating and goalscoring . Since 2017 , Ronaldo has adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free - roaming centre forward , a role in which he has continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record ; in this position , he has earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement , excellent positional sense , link - up play , clinical finishing , and opportunism , as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers , find space in the box , and score from few opportunities . </P> <H3> Reception </H3> `` In the six years ( Manchester United ) had him , you just saw his game grow all the time , and he was a fantastic player . Now you see the complete player . His decision - making , his maturity , his experience , plus all the great skills he has got , they all make him the complete player . '' <P> -- Former manager Alex Ferguson , January 2013 </P> <P> Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation , alongside Lionel Messi . Ronaldo quickly established himself among the world 's best players in his early 20s , featuring as the core component for Manchester United in the mid-to - late 2000s . However , after winning his first Ballon d'Or by a record - high vote count at age 23 , the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history . Universally acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goalscoring ability , he is considered a decisive player , who stands out in games and who can be a game changer , especially in important and high - pressured situations . Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic , elite body conditioning , and dedication to improvement on the training pitch , as well being regarded as a natural leader . His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring . </P> <P> Ronaldo has at times , however , been criticised for simulating when tackled . In addition to this , he was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson , teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player . </P> <P> During his career , Ronaldo has also been described as having an `` arrogant image '' on the pitch , with Ronaldo stating that he had become a `` victim '' , because of how he was portrayed in the media . He is often seen moaning , gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory , with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance . His managers , teammates and various journalists have commented that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him . In 2014 , Ronaldo told France Football that he had made a `` mistake '' when he said in 2011 , `` People are jealous of me as I am young , handsome and rich '' , adding that he had matured since then and fans understood him better . </P> <H3> Comparisons to Lionel Messi </H3> Main article : Messi -- Ronaldo rivalry Ronaldo with Lionel Messi before an international friendly between Portugal and Argentina in Geneva , Switzerland , on 9 February 2011 <P> Both players have scored in at least two UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50 - goal barrier in a single season . Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football . It has been compared to sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali -- Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing , the Borg -- McEnroe rivalry in tennis , and the Ayrton Senna -- Alain Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing . </P> `` It 's part of my life now . People are bound to compare us . He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team , as I do , and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent . '' <P> -- Cristiano Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi . </P> <P> Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two , while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players : Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff , while Messi is portrayed as a shy , humble character . </P> <P> In a 2012 interview , Ronaldo commented on the rivalry , saying `` I think we push each other sometimes in the competition , this is why the competition is so high '' , while Ronaldo 's manager during his time at Manchester United , Alex Ferguson , opined that `` I do n't think the rivalry against each other bothers them . I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best '' . Messi himself denied any rivalry , saying that it was `` only the media , the press , who wants us to be at loggerheads but I 've never fought with Cristiano '' . Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level , Ronaldo commented , `` We do n't have a relationship outside the world of football , just as we do n't with a lot of other players '' , before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together , stating ; `` We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit , because it 's a good thing . '' Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid , the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world 's biggest club game , El Clásico , which is among the world 's most viewed annual sporting events . </P> <P> In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013 , when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo , Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo , claiming `` one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other '' . Real Madrid demanded -- and promptly received -- a full apology , and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock - salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla , after Blatter had described him as a `` commander '' on the pitch . </P> <H2> Outside Football </H2> See also : Museu CR7 and Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport The Cristiano Ronaldo Museum , CR7 , in Funchal , Madeira .

Her mother had had several children before Reese 's birth , none of whom lived with her ; hence , Reese grew up as an only child . At six years old , Reese began singing in church . From this experience , she became an avid gospel singer . On weekends in the 1940s , she and her mother would go to the movies independently to watch the likes of Joan Crawford , Bette Davis , and Lena Horne portray glamorous lives on screen . Afterwards , Reese would act out the scenes from the films . In 1944 , she began her career directing the young people 's choir , after she had nurtured acting plus her obvious musical talent . She was often chosen , on radio , as a regular singer . At the age of 13 , she was hired to sing with Mahalia Jackson 's gospel group . Delloreese entered Detroit 's popular Cass Technical High School ( where she attended the same year as Edna Rae Gillooly , later known as Ellen Burstyn ) . She also continued with her touring with Jackson . With higher grades , she was the first in her family to graduate from high school in 1947 , at only 15 . </P> <P> Afterwards , she formed her own gospel group , the Meditation Singers . However , due in part to the death of her mother and her father 's serious illness , Reese had to interrupt her schooling at Wayne State University to help support her family . Faithful to the memory of her mother , Delloreese moved out of her father 's house when she disapproved of him taking up with a new girlfriend . She then took on odd jobs , such as truck driver , dental receptionist , and elevator operator , after 1949 . Performing in clubs , Early soon decided to shorten her name from `` Delloreese Early '' to `` Della Reese '' . </P> <H2> Musical career ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

Reese remained there for eight weeks . Although her roots were in gospel music , she now was being exposed to and influenced by such jazz artists as Ella Fitzgerald , Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday . In 1953 , she signed a recording contract with Jubilee Records , for which she recorded six albums . Later that year , she also joined the Hawkins Orchestra . Her first recordings for Jubilee were songs such as `` In the Still of the Night '' ( originally published in 1937 ) , `` I 've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm '' and `` Time After Time '' ( 1947 ) . The songs were later included on the album And That Reminds Me ( 1959 ) . </P> <P> In 1957 , Reese released a single called `` And That Reminds Me '' . After years of performing , she gained chart success with this song . It became a Top Twenty pop hit and a million - seller record . That year , Reese was voted by Billboard , Cashbox and various other magazines , as `` The Most Promising Singer '' . In 1959 , Reese moved to RCA Records and released her first RCA single , called `` Do n't You Know ? , '' which was adapted from Giacomo Puccini 's music for La bohème , specifically , the aria `` Quando m'en vo ' '' ( Musetta 's Waltz ) . It became her biggest hit to date , reaching the number 2 spot on the pop charts and topping the R&B charts ( then called the `` Hot R&B Sides '' ) that year . It sold over one million copies , and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA . Eventually , the song came to be widely considered the signature song of her early career . She then released a successful follow - up single called `` Not One Minute More '' ( number 16 ) . She remained on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with `` And Now '' ( number 69 ) . In 1960 she released `` Someday ( You 'll Want Me to Want You ) '' ( number 56 ) which was drawn from her Grammy - nominated album Della . The album rose in the pop album charts to number 35 . </P> <P> In November 1960 , Reese appeared in advertisements in Ebony magazine for the newly launched AMI Continental jukebox . Reese recorded regularly throughout the 1960s , releasing singles and several albums . Two of the most significant were The Classic Della ( 1962 ) and Waltz with Me , Della ( 1963 ) , which broadened her fan base internationally . She recorded several jazz - focused albums , including Della Reese Live ( 1966 ) , On Strings of Blue ( 1967 ) and One of a Kind ( 1978 ) . She also performed in Las Vegas for nine years and toured across the country . Reese continued to record albums in the following decades , receiving two more Grammy nominations in the gospel category for the album Della Reese and Brilliance ( 1991 ) and for the live recorded album , My Soul Feels Better Right Now ( 1999 ) . Motown singer Martha Reeves cites Reese as a major influence and says she named her group The Vandellas after Van Dyke Street in Detroit and Della Reese . </P> <H2> Television and film career ( edit ) </H2> Reese appearing in a Kraft Foods commercial , 1977 . <P> In 1969 , Reese began a transition into acting work which would eventually lead to her highest profile . Her first attempt at television stardom was a talk show series , Della , which was cancelled after 197 episodes ( June 9 , 1969 -- March 13 , 1970 ) . In 1970 , Reese became the first black woman to guest host The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . She appeared in several TV movies and miniseries , was a regular on Chico and the Man and played the mother of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team episode `` Lease with an Option to Die '' . In 1991 , she starred opposite her old friend Redd Foxx in his final sitcom , The Royal Family , but his death halted production of the series for several months . Reese also did voice - over for the late 1980s Hanna - Barbera animated series A Pup Named Scooby - Doo on ABC . In 1989 , she starred alongside Eddie Murphy , Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in the film Harlem Nights , in which she performed a fight scene with Eddie Murphy . Reese appeared as a panelist on several episodes of the popular television game show Match Game . </P> <H3> Television guest appearances ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reese has had a wide variety of guest - starring roles , beginning with an episode of The Mod Squad . This led to other roles in such series as : The Bold Ones : The New Doctors , Getting Together , Police Woman , Petrocelli , Joe Forrester , Police Story , The Rookies , McCloud , Sanford and Son with old friend Redd Foxx , Vega $ , Insight and two episodes of The Love Boat . She also had a recurring role on It Takes Two opposite Richard Crenna and Patty Duke , three episodes of Crazy Like a Fox , four episodes of Charlie & Co. opposite Flip Wilson , 227 with best friend Marla Gibbs , MacGyver , Night Court , Dream On , Designing Women , Picket Fences , Disney Channel 's That 's So Raven and The Young and the Restless . </P> <H3> Touched by an Angel ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After coping with the death of one of her best friends , Redd Foxx , in 1991 , she was reluctant to play an older female lead in the inspirational television drama Touched by an Angel , but went ahead and auditioned for the role of Tess . She wanted to have a one - shot agreement between CBS and producer Martha Williamson , but ordered more episodes . Reese was widely seen as a key component of the show 's success . Already starring on Touched by an Angel was the lesser - known Irish actress Roma Downey , who played the role of case worker Tess 's angel / employee , Monica . In numerous interviews , there was an on - and off - screen chemistry between both Reese and Downey . The character of Tess was the angelic supervisor who sent the other angels out on missions to help people redeem their lives and show them God 's love , while at the same time , she was sassy and had a no - nonsense attitude . The show often featured a climactic monologue delivered by the angel Monica in which she reveals herself as an angel to a human with the words : `` I am an angel sent by God to tell you that He loves you . '' The character of Tess was portrayed by Reese as down - to - earth , experienced and direct . Reese also sang the show 's theme song , `` Walk with You '' , and was featured prominently on the soundtrack album produced in conjunction with the show . </P> <P> During its first season in 1994 , many critics were skeptical about the show , it being the second overtly religious prime - time fantasy series , after Highway to Heaven . The show had a rocky start , low ratings and was cancelled 11 episodes into the first season . However , with the help of a massive letter - writing campaign , the show was resuscitated the following season and became a huge ratings winner for the next seven seasons . At the beginning of the fourth season in 1997 , Reese threatened to leave the show because she was making less than her co-stars ; CBS ended up raising her salary . Touched by an Angel was cancelled in 2003 , but it continued re-running heavily in syndication and on Ion Television ( formerly PAX - TV ) , The Hallmark Channel , Up , and later MeTV . Roma Downey said of her on - and off - screen relationship with Reese : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> She 's very wise . She 's very loving . She can be a little gruff at times , but she 's always adoring and adorable . I lost my mother when I was very young , and during my whole adolescence and into my twenties , I 'd been looking for a mother figure , and I really think I can say with absolute truth and sincerity that I feel that I finally found her in Della Reese . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Downey later also said : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I think I 'll just always remember the feel of her neck against my cheek when she hugs me and the love I know that she has for me and the love that I feel for her and the love that she has for God . To know Della is to know that she loves God . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2005 , Reese was honored by Oprah Winfrey at her Legends Ball ceremony , along with 25 other black women . On July 6 , 2011 , Reese celebrated her 80th birthday at the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles . In 2015 , a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her . Della Reese was the godmother of Roma Downey 's daughter Reilly Marie . Reese officiated at the marriage ceremony of Roma Downey and Mark Burnett in the absence of Downey 's late mother . </P> <H3> Family ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reese 's mother , Nellie Mitchelle Early , died in 1949 of an intracerebral hemorrhage . Reese 's father , Richard Early , died ten years later . Reese had an adoptive daughter whom she acquired from a family member unable to care for her , named Delorese Daniels Owens , in 1961 . Owens died on March 14 , 2002 . She passed away from complications stemming from pituitary disease . Reese said about the painful experience , sharing her frustration with the lack of awareness and knowledge of pituitary disorders : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> When it happened , I thought , ' It 's such an odd thing to die from , ' because pituitary problems are n't something you hear about . It makes it harder because you do n't understand what happened . It seemed so strange and hard to explain . It still is , to be honest . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Marriages ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1952 , Reese married factory worker Vermont Adolphus Bon Taliaferro , nineteen years her senior , and adopted the stage name Pat Ferro for a week , before introducing the stage name she used for the rest of her life -- though sources differ as to whether this was after the failure of the marriage , or simply a show - business decision . A second marriage ceremony , on December 28 , 1959 , to accountant Leroy Basil Gray , who had two children by a previous marriage , was kept secret for some time . This marriage either ended in divorce or was annulled on the basis that Gray 's previous divorce was invalid . Reese appears to have been briefly married to Mercer Ellington ( who was then her manager ) in 1961 , before this was annulled later that year due to Ellington 's Mexican divorce being ruled invalid.In 1983 , she married Franklin Thomas Lett , Jr. , a concert producer and writer . </P> <H3> Health ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1979 , after taping a guest spot for The Tonight Show , she suffered a near - fatal brain aneurysm , but made a full recovery after two surgeries by neurosurgeon Charles Drake at University Hospital in London , Ontario . In 2016 , shortly after her 85th birthday , Reese was said to be in poor health , and had undergone multiple surgeries . She further disclosed that she had neglected her health for years , which had contributed to her developing diabetes . After her last appearance on Signed , Sealed , Delivered , she had retired from acting . While Reese sometimes used a wheelchair , she avoided using one often , because it would make her condition worse . </P> <H3> Ministry ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1980s , Reese was ordained as a minister through the Christian New Thought branch known as Unity , after serving as the senior minister and founder of her own church , Understanding Principles for Better Living . The `` Up Church '' is under Universal Foundation for Better Living , a denomination of Christian New Thought founded by Rev. Johnnie Colemon , a close friend of Rev. Reese - Lett . As of 2009 , they meet at First Lutheran Church in Inglewood , California . In her ministerial work , she was known as the Rev. Dr. Della Reese Lett . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> <P> Reese died on November 19 , 2017 , at her Los Angeles , California , home at the age of 86 . No cause was given , although she had suffered from Type 2 - diabetes. . Her representative Lynda Blensky told USA Today , `` We lost a magnificent woman who was a trailblazer in many ways . '' </P> <P> Longtime friends Roma Downey ( with whom she worked on Touched by an Angel ) and Jackee Harry ( with whom she worked on 227 and The Royal Family ) reflected on her death . Downey said , `` On behalf of her husband , Franklin Lett , and all her friends and family , I share with you the news that our beloved Della Reese has passed away peacefully at her California home last evening surrounded by love , '' She then said : `` She was an incredible wife , mother , grandmother , friend , and pastor , as well as an award - winning actress and singer . Through her life and work , she touched and inspired the lives of millions of people . She was a mother to me and I had the privilege of working with her side by side for so many years on Touched by an Angel . I know heaven has a brand new angel this day . Della Reese will be forever in our hearts . Rest In Peace , sweet angel . We love you . '' </P> <P> Harry tweeted , `` I am completely devastated by the loss of Della Reese . She was a great co-star , sparring partner , drinking buddy , and friend . She taught me the power of prayer and the importance of humility . I 'll be forever grateful to call her my friend .

The Pelicans compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member club of the league 's Western Conference Southwest Division . The team plays their home games in the Smoothie King Center ( formerly known as the New Orleans Arena ) . </P> <P> The Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the 2002 -- 03 season when then - owner of the Charlotte Hornets , George Shinn , relocated the franchise to New Orleans . Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the franchise temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City , where they spent two seasons officially known as the New Orleans / Oklahoma City Hornets . The team returned to New Orleans full - time for the 2007 -- 08 season . On January 24 , 2013 , the franchise announced it would rename itself the Pelicans , effective after the conclusion of the 2012 -- 13 season . The Charlotte Hornets name , history and records from 1988 to 2002 were returned to its original city to be used by the then -- Charlotte Bobcats franchise , which subsequently became the Charlotte Hornets , starting May 20 , 2014 . </P> <P> In 14 seasons of play since the original franchise relocated from North Carolina , the Louisiana franchise has achieved an overall regular season record of 528 -- 604 , and has qualified for the playoffs six times . Their achievements include one playoff series victory and one division title . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Franchise history <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Relocation to New Orleans </Li> <Li> 1.2 2002 -- 2005 : Early years in New Orleans </Li> <Li> 1.3 2005 -- 2011 : Chris Paul era </Li> <Li> 1.4 2011 -- 2013 : CP3 's departure ; beginning the Anthony Davis era </Li> <Li> 1.5 2013 -- present : The Pelicans take flight <Ul> <Li> 1.5. 1 2015 : Return to the playoffs </Li> <Li> 1.5. 2 2017 -- present : Davis and Cousins era </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Logos and uniforms </Li> <Li> 3 Players <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Current roster </Li> <Li> 3.2 Retained draft rights </Li> <Li> 3.3 Retired numbers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Franchise records </Li> <Li> 5 Seasons <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Head coaches </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Home arenas </Li> <Li> 7 Mascot </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Franchise history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the New Orleans Pelicans <H3> Relocation to New Orleans ( edit ) </H3> <P> While the Charlotte Hornets put a competitive team on the court throughout the 1990s , the team 's attendance began falling dramatically . Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team 's owner , George Shinn , who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city . In 1997 , a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her , and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city . The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball - crazy as ever , fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team . Shinn had also become discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum , which , although considered state - of - the - art when it opened in 1988 , had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes . On March 26 , 2001 , both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis , Tennessee , which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies . Shinn issued an ultimatum : unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him , the Hornets would leave town . The city initially refused , leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk , Louisville , or St. Louis . Of the cities in the running , only St. Louis had an NBA - ready arena ( Savvis Center , now known as Scottrade Center ) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time ; also , it was the only one of the four to have previously hosted an NBA franchise -- the St. Louis Hawks , who moved to Atlanta in 1968 . </P> <P> Finally , a new arena in Uptown , which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena ( now known as Spectrum Center ) , was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts - related package , and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team . Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage . However , just days before the referendum , Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance . The veto prompted many of the city 's black ministers to oppose the referendum ; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees were n't paid enough to make a living . After the referendum failed , city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support , but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team . While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans , league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners . The city council refused to remove the statement , leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans -- a move which would eventually return the NBA to that city since the Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979 . Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs , the NBA approved the move . As part of a deal , the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team , which took the court two years later as the Charlotte Bobcats . </P> <P> In a 2008 interview with the Charlotte Observer , Shinn , who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved , admitted that the `` bad judgment I made in my life '' played a role in the Hornets ' departure . He also said that if he had it to do all over again , he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial . Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying , `` I 've made enough mistakes in my life . I 'm not going to make one here . This city needs us here . We 're going to make this ( New Orleans ) thing work . '' </P> <H3> 2002 -- 2005 : early years in New Orleans ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hornets opened their inaugural season in New Orleans on October 30 , 2002 , against New Orleans ' original NBA franchise , the now - Utah Jazz . In the first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years , the Hornets defeated the Jazz 100 -- 75 , and posthumously retired # 7 of `` Pistol '' Pete Maravich during halftime . The Hornets finished the season with a 47 -- 35 record but were defeated by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs . Following the season , the team unexpectedly fired head coach Paul Silas and replaced him with Alan Bristow . The Hornets began the 2003 -- 04 season strong with a 17 -- 7 start but sputtered at the end and finished 41 -- 41 . They lost to the Miami Heat in the first round of the 2004 playoffs . After the season , Floyd was fired and the team hired Byron Scott as its new head coach . </P> <P> During the first two seasons in New Orleans the Hornets competed in the NBA 's Eastern Conference . The 2004 -- 05 season saw the team moved to the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . In a season marred by injury to the team 's three all - stars , the team finished the year with a franchise - worst record of 18 -- 64 . </P> <H3> 2005 -- 2011 : Chris Paul era ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the subsequent draft , the Hornets used their first round pick to select point guard Chris Paul out of Wake Forest University . </P> Chris Paul , selected by the Hornets as the 4th pick of the 2005 NBA draft <P> Because of the catastrophic devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina upon the communities of southeastern Louisiana , the Hornets franchise temporarily relocated its base of operations to Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , in 2005 -- 06 and 2006 -- 07 , posting records of 38 -- 44 and 39 -- 43 respectively . During this time , the franchise was known as the New Orleans / Oklahoma City Hornets . In these two seasons , most home games were played at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City , while a few remained at New Orleans Arena . One year after the Hornets moved back to New Orleans permanently , the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder . </P> <P> The Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full - time for the 2007 -- 08 season , with all 41 home games in the New Orleans Arena . The 2008 NBA All - Star Game and its accompanying festivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was commenced in February 2007 . Healthier than previous seasons , the Hornets raced to a 29 -- 12 record at the halfway mark , completing the regular season with a record of 56 -- 26 , making the season their most successful ever . The Hornets also won their first - ever division title , winning the Southwest Division . Having clinched the 2nd overall seed for the Western Conference in the 2008 playoffs , the Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks in the first round but eventually lost to the defending - champion San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the conference semifinals . </P> <P> In August 2008 the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the colors of Creole blue , purple , and Mardi Gras gold . Pinstripes were also added to the uniforms . The Hornets also introduced a new gold alternate uniform in 2010 which was used mostly in games played on Saturday at home and on the road . The Hornets finished the 2008 -- 09 season with a 49 -- 33 record . Paired up with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs , the Hornets were eliminated in five games . The Hornets started the 2009 -- 10 season in a disappointing fashion , and head coach Byron Scott was fired after a 3 -- 6 start to the season . General manager Jeff Bower took over the head coaching duties for the remainder of the season . The Hornets finished the season with a 37 -- 45 record , finishing last in the Southwest division they had won only two seasons before . Jeff Bower later resigned as head coach , and Monty Williams was brought in as new head coach . The team finished the 2010 -- 11 season with a 46 -- 36 record and qualified for the 2011 NBA Playoffs , where they lost to the Lakers 4 -- 2 . </P> <P> In December 2010 the NBA purchased the Hornets from George Shinn for an estimated $300 million . </P> <H3> 2011 -- 2013 : cp3 's departure ; beginning the Anthony Davis era ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before the 2011 -- 12 NBA season , the Hornets were considering trade offers for Chris Paul . Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks . The Hornets looked at many teams , including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners , but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles . A three - team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon , but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade . On December 14 , 2011 , the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon , Chris Kaman , Al - Farouq Aminu , and a first - round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004 . </P> <P> At the end of the 66 - game lockout - shortened 2011 -- 12 NBA season , the Hornets had the worst record in the West , 21 -- 45 . </P> <P> On April 13 , 2012 , it was announced that Tom Benson , owner of the New Orleans Saints , had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338 million . In addition , Benson announced that he would change the team name to something that would better suit the region , fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte , where the Bobcats play . In June 2012 , Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets as well : Saints general manager Mickey Loomis became head of basketball operations , overseeing general manager Dell Demps , and Saints business operations head Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets . </P> <P> The Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to the Wizards for Rashard Lewis , whom they bought out , and a draft pick . </P> <P> On May 30 , 2012 , the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft and subsequently drafted Anthony Davis . They also drafted Austin Rivers with the 10th pick ( acquired from the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade ) . </P> <P> On July 11 , 2012 , Ryan Anderson , 2012 's Most Improved Player and three - point field goals leader , was acquired in a sign - and - trade by the New Orleans Hornets , with the Orlando Magic , for Gustavo Ayón . </P> <H3> 2013 -- present : the Pelicans take flight ( edit ) </H3> <P> New owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team 's name to something more local , even preferring that the Utah Jazz -- founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979 , give up the `` Jazz '' name . But the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it . Benson had also heavily favored the names `` Brass '' and `` Krewe '' . </P> <P> However , on December 4 , 2012 , it was reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013 -- 14 season . The team name is inspired by Louisiana 's state bird , the brown pelican . </P> <P> The name `` Pelicans '' previously had been used by a minor - league baseball team that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957 . The Hornets organization officially confirmed the name change in a press conference held on January 24 , 2013 , where officials unveiled the team 's new logos and navy blue -- gold -- red color scheme . On April 18 , 2013 , after the end of the team 's 2012 -- 13 season , the team 's name was officially changed to the Pelicans . </P> <P> Following the New Orleans franchise 's 2013 disestablishment of the `` Hornets '' name , on May 21 , 2013 , Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014 -- 15 NBA season pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas , on July 18 , 2013 . Then - NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process . The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014 -- 15 . </P> <P> On June 27 , 2013 , during the 2013 NBA draft , the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall , and traded him along with a 2014 protected first - round pick for All - Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick , Pierre Jackson . At a May 20 , 2014 press conference announcing the Charlotte Bobcats ' official team name change to Hornets , it was also announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer the records and statistics of the original Hornets ( 1988 -- 2002 ) to the current Charlotte franchise , thus unifying all of Charlotte 's NBA basketball history under one franchise ; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to New Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans , retroactively turning the Pelicans into a 2002 expansion team . </P> <P> To restate and clarify a confusing series of events : after the 2002 season , the original Hornets moved to New Orleans . In 2004 , Charlotte was granted a new franchise , the Bobcats . After the 2013 -- 14 season , the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988 -- 2002 Hornets . As a result , the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004 , while the Pelicans are now reckoned as having joined the league in 2002 . </P> 2015 : return to the playoffs ( edit ) Alvin Gentry is the New Orleans Pelicans current head coach . <P> For the first time under the name Pelicans , the team qualified for the playoffs with a 45 -- 37 record as the number 8 seed in the Western Conference . They owned the tie - breaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder by winning the regular season head - to - head series 3 -- 1 , and they faced the Golden State Warriors in the first round ; the Warriors swept the Pelicans in four games . After the season , the Pelicans fired coach Monty Williams despite qualifying for the playoffs . </P> <P> On May 31 , 2015 , the Pelicans hired Alvin Gentry as the franchise 's 6th head coach . </P> 2017 -- present : Davis and Cousins era ( edit ) <P> On February 20 , 2017 , Pelicans acquired DeMarcus Cousins in a trade with the Sacramento Kings when they traded Buddy Hield , Tyreke Evans , Langston Galloway , a 2017 1st round pick , and a 2017 2nd round pick in exchange for Cousins and Omri Casspi . </P> <H2> Logos and uniforms ( edit ) </H2> <P> The New Orleans Hornets were sold to Tom Benson on April 13 , 2012 . After purchasing the team , Benson indicated that he wanted to change the club 's nickname to something more regionally appropriate . On December 14 , 2012 , it was reported that the Hornets would change their nickname to the New Orleans Pelicans . On January 24 , 2013 , the team held a press conference , where it unveiled its new nickname , logos and colors . The name Pelicans is a reference to the brown pelican , the state bird of Louisiana . The team said in a press release that its colors would be navy , gold and red ; each color is represented in the city flag of New Orleans . The team formally adopted its new brand identity at the end of the 2012 -- 13 NBA season . </P> <P> On August 1 , 2013 , the Pelicans released their new uniforms . The ' New Orleans ' wordmark logo across the front of the jerseys is inspired by French Quarter street signs ; the Pelicans are one of three NBA teams to wear the city name across the front of both home and road jerseys . The partial logo is featured on the sides of the shorts , and the `` Bird - de-Lis '' logo ( a combination mark of the pelican , fleur - de-lis and crescent basketball shape ) is featured on the back neck . NBA teams were not allowed to have alternate uniforms during their first season of operation . </P> <P> On September 23 , 2014 , the Pelicans unveiled a red alternate uniform for the 2014 -- 15 season that would be worn four times in the year . Prior to the red alternate uniform unveiling , the NBA announced that its league logo would be moved to the back neck of game jerseys for all 30 clubs ; as a result , the NBA league logo replaced the `` Bird - de-Lis '' logo on the back neck . </P> <P> On September 17 , 2015 , the Pelicans unveiled a new alternate uniform , introduced as part of the NBA 's `` Pride '' uniforms for the 2015 -- 16 season . The short - sleeved uniforms feature Mardi Gras ' signature colors -- purple , green and gold . The tops are purple with green accents on the sleeves and sport ' NOLA ' ( a local acronym for New Orleans , Louisiana ) across the chest in the Pelicans ' signature font in gold letters trimmed in green . The Pelicans ' NO ' logo is featured at the bottom of the v - neck and the Crescent City basketball logo is on the left sleeve in Mardi Gras colors . Additionally , the trim around the neckline is purple , green and gold - striped . Additionally , on the back of the jersey , the players ' numbers will be gold with green trim , last name in white traditional lettering and the NBA logo will be featured at the base of the neck . The purple shorts will have green and gold stripes down the side with a small secondary logo -- the `` Bird - de-Lis '' in gold centered on the waistband .

The name for the mascot was selected by the fans through an online poll on the team 's website . However , Pierre 's unconventional design frightened some fans . The mascot 's redesigned head was released on February 11 . The Pelicans ' prior mascot was Hugo the Hornet , who was part of the organization from 2002 -- 13 . Hugo returned as the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets starting with the 2014 -- 15 season . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas '' .

It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column , leading to the first craniates and vertebrates . The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha , or jawless fish . Early examples include Haikouichthys . During the late Cambrian , eel - like jawless fish called the conodonts , and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms , first appeared . Most jawless fish are now extinct ; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish . Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata , which includes the extant hagfish , and this group may have split early on from other agnathans . </P> <P> The first jawed vertebrates probably developed during the late Ordovician period . They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish : the armoured fish known as placoderms , which evolved from the ostracoderms ; and the Acanthodii ( or spiny sharks ) . The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian : the Chondrichthyes ( or cartilaginous fish ) and the Osteichthyes ( or bony fish ) . The bony fish evolved into two separate groups : the Actinopterygii ( or ray - finned fish ) and Sarcopterygii ( which includes the lobe - finned fish ) . </P> <P> During the Devonian period a great increase in fish variety occurred , especially that of the ostracoderms and placoderms , as well as lobe - finned fish and early sharks . This has led to the Devonian being known as the age of fishes . It was from the lobe - finned fish that the tetrapods evolved , the four - limbed vertebrates , represented today by amphibians , mammals , reptiles and birds . Transitional tetrapods first appeared during the early Devonian , and by the late Devonian the first tetrapods appeared . The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth ; but it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force , improved respiration , or a combination of factors . Fish do not represent a monophyletic group , but a paraphyletic one , as they exclude the tetrapods . </P> <P> Fish , like many other organisms , have been greatly affected by extinction events throughout natural history . The Ordovician -- Silurian extinction events led to the loss of many species . The late Devonian extinction led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian , as well as other fish . The spiny sharks became extinct at the Permian -- Triassic extinction event ; the conodonts became extinct at the Triassic -- Jurassic extinction event . The Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , and the present day Holocene extinction , have also affected fish variety and fish stocks . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Overview </Li> <Li> 2 Jawless fish <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Conodonts </Li> <Li> 2.2 Ostracoderms </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Jawed fish <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Placoderms </Li> <Li> 3.2 Spiny sharks </Li> <Li> 3.3 Cartilaginous fishes </Li> <Li> 3.4 Bony fishes <Ul> <Li> 3.4. 1 Lobe - finned fishes </Li> <Li> 3.4. 2 Ray - finned fishes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Timeline <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Pre Devonian : Origin of fish </Li> <Li> 4.2 Devonian : Age of fishes </Li> <Li> 4.3 Fish to tetrapods </Li> <Li> 4.4 Post Devonian </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Prehistoric fish </Li> <Li> 6 Living fossils </Li> <Li> 7 Fossil sites </Li> <Li> 8 Fossil collections </Li> <Li> 9 Paleoichthyologists </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Citations </Li> <Li> 11.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Overview ( edit ) </H2> Vertebrate classes Spindle diagram for the evolution of fish and other vertebrate classes . The diagram is based on Michael Benton , 2005 . <P> Conventional classification has living vertebrates as a subphylum grouped into eight classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits . In turn , these classes are grouped into the vertebrates that have four limbs ( the tetrapods ) and those that do not : fishes .

Further information : Vertebrate paleontology and List of transitional fossils § Invertebrates to Fish <P> Fish may have evolved from an animal similar to a coral - like sea squirt ( a tunicate ) , whose larvae resemble early fish in important ways . The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood ( as some sea squirts do today ) , although this path can not be proven . </P> <P> Vertebrates , among them the first fishes , originated about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion , which saw the rise in organism diversity . </P> The lancelet , a small , translucent , fish - like animal , is the closest living invertebrate relative of the olfactoreans ( vertebrates and tunicates ) . The early vertebrate Haikouichthys , from about 518 million years ago in China , may be the `` ancestor to all vertebrates '' and is one of the earliest known fish . Somewhat dated view of continuous evolutionary gradation ( click to animate ) <P> The first ancestors of fish , or animals that were probably closely related to fish , were Pikaia , Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia . These three genera all appeared around 530 Ma . Pikaia had a primitive notochord , a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later . Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian , these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan : a notochord , rudimentary vertebrae , and a well - defined head and tail . All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed . </P> <P> These were followed by indisputable fossil vertebrates in the form of heavily armoured fishes discovered in rocks from the Ordovician Period 500 -- 430 Ma . </P> <P> The first jawed vertebrates appeared in the late Ordovician and became common in the Devonian , often known as the `` Age of Fishes '' . The two groups of bony fishes , the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii , evolved and became common . The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes , save for lampreys and hagfish , as well as the Placodermi , a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late Silurian . The Devonian also saw the rise of the first labyrinthodonts , which was a transitional between fishes and amphibians . </P> <P> The colonisation of new niches resulted in diversification of body plans and sometimes an increase in size . The Devonian Period ( 395 to 345 Ma ) brought in such giants as the placoderm Dunkleosteus , which could grow up to seven meters long , and early air - breathing fish that could remain on land for extended periods . Among this latter group were ancestral amphibians . </P> <P> The reptiles appeared from labyrinthodonts in the subsequent Carboniferous period . The anapsid and synapsid reptiles were common during the late Paleozoic , while the diapsids became dominant during the Mesozoic . In the sea , the bony fishes became dominant . </P> <P> The later radiations , such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods , involved fewer taxa , mainly with very similar body plans . The first animals to venture onto dry land were arthropods . Some fish had lungs and strong , bony fins and could crawl onto the land also . </P> <H2> Jawless fish ( edit ) </H2> A modern jawless fish , the lamprey , attached to a modern jawed fish Lamprey mouth Main article : Agnatha <P> Jawless fishes belong to the superclass Agnatha in the phylum Chordata , subphylum Vertebrata . Agnatha comes from the Greek , and means `` no jaws '' . It excludes all vertebrates with jaws , known as gnathostomes . Although a minor element of modern marine fauna , jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic . Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins , vertebrate musculature , and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China : Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia . They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier . A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella . A possible agnathid that has not been formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia . </P> <P> Many Ordovician , Silurian , and Devonian agnathians were armoured with heavy bony - spiky plates . The first armoured agnathans -- the Ostracoderms , precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods ( including humans ) -- are known from the middle Ordovician , and by the Late Silurian the agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution . Most of the ostracoderms , such as thelodonts , osteostracans , and galeaspids , were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans , known as cyclostomes . Cyclostomes apparently split from other agnathans before the evolution of dentine and bone , which are present in many fossil agnathans , including conodonts . Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered . </P> <P> The agnathans as a whole are paraphyletic , because most extinct agnathans belong to the stem group of gnathostomes . Recent molecular data , both from rRNA and from mtDNA strongly supports the theory that living agnathans , known as cyclostomes , are monophyletic . In phylogenetic taxonomy , the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks , but illustrated as a nested `` family tree '' known as a cladogram . Phylogenetic groups are given definitions based on their relationship to one another , rather than purely on physical traits such as the presence of a backbone .

They appeared 495 Ma and were wiped out 200 Ma . Initially they were known only from tooth - like microfossils called conodont elements . These `` teeth '' have been variously interpreted as filter - feeding apparatuses or as a `` grasping and crushing array '' . Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40 cm Promissum . Their large eyes had a lateral position , which makes a predatory role unlikely . The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts ( Promissum at least ) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed . In 2012 researchers classified the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays , chevron - shaped muscles and notochord . Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys , though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups . </P> <H3> Ostracoderms ( edit ) </H3> Ostracoderms ( extinct ) were armoured jawless fishes <P> Ostracoderms ( shell - skinned ) are armoured jawless fishes of the Paleozoic . The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is paraphyletic or polyphyletic , and has no phylogenetic meaning . However , the term is still used informally to group together the armoured jawless fishes . </P> <P> The ostracoderm armour consisted of 3 -- 5 mm polygonal plates that shielded the head and gills , and then overlapped further down the body like scales . The eyes were particularly shielded . Earlier chordates used their gills for both respiration and feeding , whereas ostracoderms used their gills for respiration only . They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head , which were permanently open with no protective operculum . Unlike invertebrates that use ciliated motion to move food , ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving prey into their mouths . </P> <P> The first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms . The Swiss anatomist Louis Agassiz received some fossils of bony armored fish from Scotland in the 1830s . He had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature . He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as catfish and sturgeons but later realizing that they had no movable jaws , classified them in 1844 into a new group `` ostracoderms '' . </P> <P> Ostracoderms existed in two major groups , the more primitive heterostracans and the cephalaspids . Later , about 420 million years ago , the jawed fish evolved from one of the ostracoderms . After the appearance of jawed fish , most ostracoderm species underwent a decline , and the last ostracoderms became extinct at the end of the Devonian period . </P> <H2> Jawed fish ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article includes a list of references , but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations .

The two most anterior pharyngeal arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch , respectively . The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull , permitting great mobility of the jaws . Already long assumed to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to more derived gnathostomes , the discovery of Entelognathus suggests that placoderms are directly ancestral to modern bony fish . </P> <P> As in most vertebrates , fish jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically , comprising an upper jaw and a lower jaw . The jaw is derived from the most anterior two pharyngeal arches supporting the gills , and usually bears numerous teeth . The skull of the last common ancestor of today 's jawed vertebrates is assumed to have resembled sharks . </P> <P> It is thought that the original selective advantage garnered by the jaw was not related to feeding , but to increased respiration efficiency . The jaws were used in the buccal pump ( observable in modern fish and amphibians ) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians . Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws ( to humans ) , in feeding , was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates . Many teleost fish have substantially modified their jaws for suction feeding and jaw protrusion , resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved . </P> <P> Jawed vertebrates and jawed fish evolved from earlier jawless fish , and the cladogram below for jawed vertebrates is a continuation of the cladogram in the section above .

The diagram is based on Michael Benton , 2005 . Placoderms ( extinct ) were armoured jawed fishes ( compare with the ostracoderms above ) Further information : Placodermi and List of placoderms <P> Placoderms , class Placodermi ( plate skinned ) , are extinct armoured prehistoric fish , which appeared about 430 Ma in the Early to Middle Silurian . They were mostly wiped out during the Late Devonian Extinction event , 378 Ma , though some survived and made a slight recovery in diversity during the Famennian epoch before dying out entirely at the close of the Devonian , 360 mya ; they are ultimately ancestal to modern vertebrates . Their head and thorax were covered with massive and often ornamented armoured plates . The rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species . The armour shield was articulated , with the head armour hinged to the thoratic armour . This allowed placoderms to lift their heads , unlike ostracoderms . Placoderms were the first jawed fish ; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches . The chart on the right shows the rise and demise of the separate placoderm lineages : Acanthothoraci , Rhenanida , Antiarchi , Petalichthyidae , Ptyctodontida and Arthrodira . </P> <H3> Spiny sharks ( edit ) </H3> Spiny sharks ( extinct ) were the earliest known jawed fishes . They resembled sharks and were indeed ancestral to them . Further information : Acanthodii and List of acanthodians <P> Spiny sharks , class Acanthodii , are extinct fishes that share features with both bony and cartilaginous fishes , though ultimately more closely related to and ancestral to the latter . Despite being called `` spiny sharks '' , acanthodians predate sharks , though they gave rise to them . They evolved in the sea at the beginning of the Silurian Period , some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared . Eventually competition from bony fishes proved too much , and the spiny sharks died out in Permian times about 250 Ma . In form they resembled sharks , but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans ( gars , bowfins ) . </P> <H3> Cartilaginous fishes ( edit ) </H3> Radiation of cartilaginous fishes , derived from work by Michael Benton , 2005 . Further information : List of transitional fossils § Chondrichthyes , and List of prehistoric cartilaginous fish <P> Cartilaginous fishes , class Chondrichthyes , consisting of sharks , rays and chimaeras , appeared by about 395 million years ago , in the middle Devonian , evolving from acanthodians . The class contains the sub classes Holocephali ( chimaera ) and Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) . The radiation of elasmobranches in the chart on the right is divided into the taxa : Cladoselache , Eugeneodontiformes , Symmoriida , Xenacanthiformes , Ctenacanthiformes , Hybodontiformes , Galeomorphi , Squaliformes and Batoidea . </P> <H3> Bony fishes ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Osteichthyes , List of transitional fossils § Bony fish , and List of prehistoric bony fish <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Chordate Evolution and Bony Fish YouTube </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Bony fishes , class Osteichthyes , are characterised by bony skeleton rather than cartilage . They appeared in the late Silurian , about 419 million years ago . The recent discovery of Entelognathus strongly suggests that bony fishes ( and possibly cartilaginous fishes , via acanthodians ) evolved from early placoderms . A subclass of the Osteichthyes , the ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) , have become the dominant group of fishes in the post-Paleozoic and modern world , with some 30,000 living species . </P> <P> The bony ( and cartilaginous ) fish groups that emerged after the Devonian , were characterised by steady improvements in foraging and locomotion . </P> Lobe - finned fishes ( edit ) Further information : Sarcopterygii and List of lobe - finned fishes The Queensland lungfish is a lobe - finned fish that is a living fossil . Lungfish evolved the first proto - lungs and proto - limbs . They developed the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian ( 397 - 385 Ma ) , and have remained virtually the same for over 100 million years . Phylogenomic analysis has shown that `` the closest living fish to the tetrapod ancestor is the lungfish , not the coelacanth '' . <P> Lobe - finned fishes , fish belonging to the class Sarcopterygii , are mostly extinct bony fishes , basally characterised by robust and stubby lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton , cosmoid scales and internal nostrils . Their fins are fleshy , lobed , paired fins , joined to the body by a single bone . The fins of lobe - finned fish differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy , lobelike , scaly stalk extending from the body . The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to . The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates , amphibians . They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases , as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray - finned fish . The braincase of lobe - finned fishes primitively has a hinge line , but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish . Many early lobe - finned fishes have a symmetrical tail . All lobe - finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel . </P> <P> Lobe - finned fishes , such as coelacanths and lungfish , were the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian . Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within the Sarcopterygii , and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four - limbed vertebrates . The fin - limbs of lobe - finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs . The lobe - finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses , the Rhipidistia ( including the lungfish , and the Tetrapodomorpha , which include the Tetrapoda ) and the Actinistia ( coelacanths ) . The first lobe - finned fishes , found in the uppermost Silurian ( ca 418 Ma ) , closely resembled spiny sharks , which became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic . In the early -- middle Devonian ( 416 - 385 Ma ) , while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas , some lobe - finned fishes came into freshwater habitats . </P> The coelacanth is another lobe - finned fish that is a living fossil . It is thought to have evolved into roughly its current form about 408 million years ago , during the early Devonian , and has not essentially evolved further from its ancient form . <P> In the Early Devonian ( 416 - 397 Ma ) , the lobe - finned fishes split into two main lineages -- the coelacanths and the rhipidistians . The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the Late Devonian and Carboniferous , from 385 to 299 Ma , as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic ; coelacanths still live today in the oceans ( genus Latimeria ) . The Rhipidistians , whose ancestors probably lived in estuaries , migrated into freshwater habitats . They in turn split into two major groups : the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs . The lungfish 's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period ; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left . The lungfish evolved the first proto - lungs and proto - limbs ; developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian ( 397 - 385 Ma ) . The first tetrapodomorphs , which included the gigantic rhizodonts , had the same general anatomy as the lungfish , who were their closest kin , but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch ( 385 - 359 Ma ) , with the appearance of tetrapods ( four - legged vertebrates ) . Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian . Lobe - finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era , suffering heavy losses during the Permian - Triassic extinction event ( 251 Ma ) . </P> Ray - finned fishes ( edit ) <P> Ray - finned fishes , class Actinopterygii , differ from lobe - finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin supported by spines ( `` rays '' ) made of bone or horn . There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures . Ray - finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone , though this is not true of sturgeons and paddlefishes . </P> <P> Ray - finned fishes are the dominant vertebrate group , containing half of all known vertebrate species . They inhabit abyssal depths in the sea , coastal inlets and freshwater rivers and lakes , and are a major source of food for humans . </P> <H2> Timeline ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Preceded by Proterozoic Eon </Th> <Th_colspan=""12""> Phanerozoic Eon </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""6""> Paleozoic Era </Th> <Th_colspan=""3""> Mesozoic Era </Th> <Th_colspan=""3""> Cenozoic Era </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Cambrian </Th> <Th> Ordovician </Th> <Th> Silurian </Th> <Th> Devonian </Th> <Th> Carboniferous </Th> <Th> Permian </Th> <Th> Triassic </Th> <Th> Jurassic </Th> <Th> Cretaceous </Th> <Th> Paleogene </Th> <Th> Neogene </Th> <Th> 4ry </Th> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Pre Devonian : origin of fish ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Cambrian </Th> <Td_colspan=""3""> Cambrian ( 541 -- 485 Ma ) : The beginning of the Cambrian was marked by the Cambrian explosion , the sudden appearance of nearly all of the invertebrate animal phyla ( molluscs , jellyfish , worms and arthropods , such as crustaceans ) in great abundance .

Pikaia is a genus that appeared about 530 Ma during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life . Pikaia gracilens ( pictured ) is a transitional fossil between invertebrates and vertebrates , and may be the earliest known chordate . In this sense it may have been the original ancestor of fishes . It was a primitive creature with no evidence of eyes , without a well defined head , and less than 2 inches ( 5 centimetres ) long . Pikaia was a sideways - flattened , leaf - shaped animal that swam by throwing its body into a series of S - shaped , zig - zag curves , similar to movement of snakes . Fish inherited the same swimming movement , but they generally have stiffer backbones . It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages , which may be linked to gill slits , on either side of its head . Pikaia shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates . The flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks , seen as faint vertical lines . The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Haikouichthys </Td> <Td> Haikouichthys ( fish from Haikou ) is another genus that also appears in the fossil record about 530 Ma , and also marks the transition from invertebrate to vertebrates .

They also had a defined skull and other characteristics that have led paleontologists to label it a true craniate , and even to be popularly characterized as one of the earliest fishes .

It was about 15 cm ( 6 in ) long , with a streamlined body covered in rows of knobbly armoured scutes . The front of the body and the head were protected by hard plates with openings for the eyes , nostrils and gills . Although it was jawless , Arandaspis might have had some moveable plates in its mouth , serving as lips , sucking in food particles . The low position of its mouth suggests it foraged the ocean floor . It lacked fins and its only method of propulsion was its horizontally flattened tail . As a result , it probably swam in a fashion similar to a modern tadpole . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Astraspis </Td> <Td> Astraspis ( star shield ) is an extinct genus of primitive jawless fish related to other Ordovician fishes , such as Sacabambaspis and Arandaspis . Fossils show clear evidence of a sensory structure ( lateral line system ) . The arrangement of these organs in regular lines allows the fish to detect the direction and distance from which a disturbance in the water is coming . Arandaspis are thought to have had a mobile tail covered with small protective plates and a head region covered with larger plates . A specimen described by Sansom et al. had relatively large , lateral eyes and a series of eight gill openings on each side . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pteraspidomorphi </Td> <Td> Pteraspidomorphi is an extinct class of early jawless fish . The fossils show extensive shielding of the head . Many had hypocercal tails to generate lift to increase ease of movement through the water for their armoured bodies , which were covered in dermal bone . They also had sucking mouth parts and some species may have lived in fresh water . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Thelodonts </Td> <Td> Thelodonts ( nipple teeth ) are a class of small , extinct jawless fishes with distinctive scales instead of large plates of armour . There is debate over whether these represent a monophyletic grouping , or disparate stem groups to the major lines of jawless and jawed fish . Thelodonts are united by their characteristic `` thelodont scales '' . This defining character is not necessarily a result of shared ancestry , as it may have been evolved independently by different groups . Thus the thelodonts are generally thought to represent a polyphyletic group . If they are monophyletic , there is no firm evidence on what their ancestral state was . These scales were easily dispersed after death ; their small size and resilience makes them the most common vertebrate fossil of their time . The fish lived in both freshwater and marine environments , first appearing during the Ordovician , and perishing during the Frasnian -- Famennian extinction event of the Late Devonian . They were predominantly deposit - feeding bottom dwellers , although some species may have been pelagic . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""3""> The Ordovician ended with the Ordovician -- Silurian extinction event ( 450 -- 440 Ma ) .

They are classically regarded as the ancestors of lampreys . Anaspids were small , primarily marine agnathans that lacked heavy bony shield and paired fins , but have highly exaggerated hypocercal tails . They first appeared in the early Silurian , and flourished until the Late Devonian extinction , where most species , save for lampreys , became extinct . Unusually for an agnathan , anaspids did not possess a bony shield or armour . The head is instead covered in an array of smaller , weakly mineralised scales . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Osteostraci </Td> <Td> Osteostraci ( `` bony shields '' ) was a class of bony - armored jawless fish that lived from the Middle Silurian to Late Devonian . Anatomically speaking , the osteostracans , especially the Devonian species , were among the most advanced of all known agnathans . This is due to the development of paired fins , and their complicated cranial anatomy . The osteostracans were more similar to lampreys than to jawed vertebrates in possessing two pairs of semicircular canals in the inner ear , as opposed to the three pairs found in the inner ears of jawed vertebrates . Most osteostracans had a massive cephalothorac shield , but all Middle and Late Devonian species appear to have had a reduced , thinner , and often micromeric dermal skeleton . They were probably relatively good swimmers , possessing dorsal fins , paired pectoral fins , and a strong tail . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Spiny sharks </Td> <Td> Spiny sharks , more formally called `` Acanthodians '' ( having spines ) , constitute the class Acanthodii . They first appeared by the late Silurian ~ 420 Ma , and were among the first fishes to evolve jaws . They share features with both cartilaginous fish and bony fish , but they are not true sharks , though leading to them . They became extinct before the end of the Permian ~ 250 Ma . However , scales and teeth attributed to this group , as well as more derived jawed fish , such as cartilaginous and bony fish , date from the Ordovician ~ 460 Ma . Acanthodians were generally small shark - like fishes varying from toothless filter - feeders to toothed predators . They were once often classified as an order of the class Placodermi , but recent authorities tend to place the acanthodians as a paraphyletic assemblage leading to modern cartilaginous fish . They are distinguished in two respects : they were the earliest known jawed vertebrates , and they had stout spines supporting all their fins , fixed in place and non-movable ( like a shark 's dorsal fin ) , an important defensive adaptation . Their fossils are extremely rare . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Placoderms </Td> <Td> Placoderms , ( plate - like skin ) , are a group of armoured jawed fishes , of the class Placodermi . The oldest fossils appeared during the late Silurian , and became extinct at the end of the Devonian . Recent studies suggest that the placoderms are possibly a paraphyletic group of basal jawed fishes , and the closest relatives of all living jawed vertebrates . Some placoderms were small , flattened bottom - dwellers , such as antiarchs . However many , particularly the arthrodires , were active midwater predators . Dunkleosteus , which appeared later in the Devonian below , was the largest and most famous of these .

Axis scale : millions of years ago . <P> The Devonian Period is broken into the Early , Middle and Late Devonian . By the start of the Early Devonian 419 mya , jawed fishes had divided into four distinct clades : the placoderms and spiny sharks , both of which are now extinct , and the cartilaginous and bony fishes , both of which are still extant . The modern bony fishes , class Osteichthyes , appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian , about 416 million years ago . Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks . A subclass of bony fishes , the ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) , have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world , with some 30,000 living species . </P> <P> Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high . Marine faunas were dominated by bryozoa , diverse and abundant brachiopods , the enigmatic hederelloids , microconchids and corals . Lily - like crinoids were abundant , and trilobites were still fairly common . Among vertebrates , jawless armoured fish ( ostracoderms ) declined in diversity , while the jawed fish ( gnathostomes ) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water . Armoured placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian , perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species . Early cartilaginous ( Chondrichthyes ) and bony fishes ( Osteichthyes ) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas . The first abundant genus of shark , Cladoselache , appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period . The great diversity of fish around at the time have led to the Devonian being given the name `` The Age of Fish '' in popular culture . </P> <P> The first ray - finned and lobe - finned bony fish appeared in the Devonian , while the placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment . However , another subclass of Osteichthyes , the Sarcopterygii , including lobe - finned fishes including coelacanths and lungfish ) and tetrapods , was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian . Sarcopterygians are basally characterized by internal nostrils , lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton , and cosmoid scales . </P> <P> During the Middle Devonian 393 -- 383 Ma , the armoured jawless ostracoderm fishes were declining in diversity ; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater . The shallow , warm , oxygen - depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes , surrounded by primitive plants , provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time . Cartilaginous fishes , class Chondrichthyes , consisting of sharks , rays and chimaeras , appeared by about 395 million years ago , in the middle Devonian </P> <P> During the Late Devonian the first forests were taking shape on land . The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record over a period , the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events . This lasted until the end of the Devonian 359 mya . The ancestors of all tetrapods began adapting to walking on land , their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs ( see Tiktaalik ) . In the oceans , primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and the late Ordovician . The first ammonite mollusks appeared . Trilobites , the mollusk - like brachiopods and the great coral reefs , were still common . </P> <P> The Late Devonian extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period , the Famennian faunal stage , ( the Frasnian - Famennian boundary ) , about 372.2 Ma . Many fossil agnathan fishes , save for the psammosteid heterostracans , make their last appearance shortly before this event . The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community , and selectively affected shallow warm - water organisms rather than cool - water organisms . The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef - builders of the great Devonian reef - systems . </P> <P> A second extinction pulse , the Hangenberg event closed the Devonian period and had a dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas . Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event , as did most members of other groups including lobe - finned fishes , acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats , leaving only a handful of survivors . This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""5""> Devonian ( 419 -- 359 mya ) : The start of Devonian saw the first appearance of lobe - finned fish , precursors to the tetrapods ( animals with four limbs ) .

Its rounded scales and body form indicate that it could have swum quickly through the water to catch prey . Similar to other rhipidistians , it had fang - like teeth on its palate in addition to smaller teeth on the jaws . Its asymmetrical tail sported a caudal fin on its lower end .

Their armor was reduced to a pattern of small plates around the head and neck . Like the extinct and related acanthothoracids , and the living and unrelated holocephalians , most of the ptyctodontids are thought to have lived near the sea bottom and preyed on shellfish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Petalichthyida </Td> <Td> The Petalichthyida was an order of small , flattened placoderms that existed from the beginning of the Devonian to the Late Devonian .

Laccognathus grew to 1 -- 2 metres ( 3 -- 7 ft ) in length . They had very short dorsoventrally flattened heads , less than one - fifth the length of the body . The skeleton was structured so large areas of skin were stretched over solid plates of bone . This bone was composed of particularly dense fibers -- so dense that exchange of oxygen through the skin was unlikely . Rather , the dense ossifications served to retain water inside the body as Laccognathus traveled on land between bodies of water . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Middle Devonian </Td> <Td_colspan=""3""> Middle Devonian ( 393 -- 383 Ma ) : Cartilaginous fishes , consisting of sharks , rays and chimaeras , appeared about 395 Ma . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Dipterus </Td> <Td> Dipterus ( two wings ) is an extinct genus of lungfish from 376 -- 361 Ma .

It had a very weak jaw joint compared with modern - day sharks , but it compensated for that with very strong jaw - closing muscles . Its teeth were multi-cusped and smooth - edged , making them suitable for grasping , but not tearing or chewing . Cladoselache therefore probably seized prey by the tail and swallowed it whole . It had powerful keels that extended onto the side of the tail stalk and a semi-lunate tail fin , with the superior lobe about the same size as the inferior . This combination helped with its speed and agility , which was useful when trying to outswim its probable predator , the heavily armoured 10 metres ( 33 ft ) long placoderm fish Dunkleosteus . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Coccosteus </Td> <Td> Coccosteus ( seed bone ) is an extinct genus of arthrodire placoderm .

Like all other arthrodires , Coccosteus had a joint between the armour of the body and skull . In addition , it also had an internal joint between its neck vertebrae and the back of the skull , allowing it to open its mouth even wider . Along with the longer jaws , this allowed Coccosteus to feed on fairly large prey . As with all other arthrodires , Coccosteus had bony dental plates embedded in its jaws , forming a beak .

Ichthyostega ( hindleg ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The first tetrapods are four - legged , air - breathing , terrestrial animals from which the land vertebrates descended , including humans . They evolved from lobe - finned fish of the clade Sarcopterygii , appearing in coastal water in the middle Devonian , and giving rise to the first amphibians . </P> <P> The group of lobe - finned fishes that were the ancestors of the tetrapod are grouped together as the Rhipidistia , and the first tetrapods evolved from these fish over the relatively short timespan 385 -- 360 Ma . The early tetrapod groups themselves are grouped as Labyrinthodontia . They retained aquatic , fry - like tadpoles , a system still seen in modern amphibians . From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land , possibly so they could go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper . However , in 1987 , nearly complete fossils of Acanthostega from about 363 Ma showed that this Late Devonian transitional animal had legs and both lungs and gills , but could never have survived on land : its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight ; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight ; its fish - like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground . The current hypothesis is that Acanthostega , which was about 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) long , was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water . Its skeleton differed from that of most fish , in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged , including : its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air ; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together , providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head ; the head is not joined to the shoulder girdle and it has a distinct neck . </P> Until the 1980s early transitional lobe - finned fishes , such as the Eusthenopteron shown here , were depicted as emerging onto land . Paleontologists now widely agree this did not happen , and they were strictly aquatic . <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Tetrapod Evolution Animal Planet 1 2 3 4 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Evolution fish with fingers Transitional fossils -- YouTube </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air - breathing would have been an advantage : leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation ; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them ; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish ; air - breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen , since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen . </P> <P> There are three major hypotheses as to how tetrapods evolved their stubby fins ( proto - limbs ) . The traditional explanation is the `` shrinking waterhole hypothesis '' or `` desert hypothesis '' posited by the American paleontologist Alfred Romer . He believed limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up . </P> <P> The second hypothesis is the `` inter-tidal hypothesis '' put forward in 2010 by a team of Polish paleontologists led by Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki . They argued that sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from intertidal zones rather than inland bodies of water . Their hypothesis is based on the discovery of the 395 million - year - old Zachełmie tracks in Zachełmie , Poland , the oldest ever discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods . </P> <P> The third hypothesis , the `` woodland hypothesis '' , was proposed by the American paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack in 2011 . He argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water in woodlands as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation . He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded floodplains . </P> <P> Research by Jennifer A. Clack and her colleagues showed that the very earliest tetrapods , animals similar to Acanthostega , were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land . This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land -- either in search of prey ( like modern mudskippers ) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out -- and later evolved legs , lungs , etc . </P> <P> Two ideas about the homology of arms , hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years . First that digits are unique to tetrapods and second that antecedents were present in the fins of early sarcopterygian fish . Until recently it was believed that `` genetic and fossil data support the hypothesis that digits are evolutionary novelties '' . However new research that created a three - dimensional reconstruction of Panderichthys , a coastal fish from the Devonian period 385 million years ago , shows that these animals already had many of the homologous bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates . For example , they had radial bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm - like base of their fins . Thus there was in the evolution of tetrapods a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and eventually replaced by early digits . This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of actinopterygians , sharks and lungfish that the digits of tetrapods arose from pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish . Controversy still exists since Tiktaalik , a vertebrate often considered the missing link between fishes and land - living animals , had stubby leg - like limbs that lacked the finger - like radial bones found in the Panderichthys . The researchers of the paper commented that it `` is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is autapomorphic , that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent , or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik . At any rate , it demonstrates that the fish -- tetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures . '' . </P> <P> From the end of the Devonian to the Mid Carboniferous a 30 million year gap occurs in the fossil record . This gap , called Romer 's gap , is marked by the absence of ancestral tetrapod fossils and fossils of other vertebrates that look well - adapted for life on land . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=""4""> Transition from lobe - finned fishes to tetrapods </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ~ 385 Ma </Td> <Td> Eusthenopteron </Td> <Td> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Eusthenopteron -- Animal Planet </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Genus of extinct lobe - finned fishes that has attained an iconic status from its close relationships to tetrapods .

Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands , coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time , and there is much to suggest that this is the kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved .

Stethacanthus ' unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals . Apart from the fins , Stethacanthidae resembled Falcatus ( below ) . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Falcatus </Td> <Td> Falcatus is a genus of small cladodont - toothed sharks that lived 335 -- 318 Ma . They were about 25 -- 30 cm ( 10 -- 12 in ) long . They are characterised by the prominent fin spines that curved anteriorly over their heads . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Orodus </Td> <Td> Orodus is another shark of the Carboniferous , a genus from the family Orodontidae that lived into the early Permian from 303 to 295 Ma .

It had gills but no teeth , and was presumably a filter feeder . Acanthodes had only two skull bones and were covered in cubical scales . Each paired pectoral and pelvic fins had one spine , as did the single anal and dorsal fins , giving it a total of six spines , less than half that of many other spiny sharks . Acanthodians share qualities of both bony fish ( osteichthyes ) and cartilaginous fish ( chondrichthyes ) , and it has been suggested that they may have been stem chondrichthyans and stem gnathostomes . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""3""> The Permian ended with the most extensive extinction event recorded in paleontology : the Permian - Triassic extinction event . 90 % to 95 % of marine species became extinct , as well as 70 % of all land organisms . It is also the only known mass extinction of insects . Recovery from the Permian - Triassic extinction event was protracted ; land ecosystems took 30M years to recover , and marine ecosystems took even longer . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Triassic </Th> <Td_colspan=""3""> Triassic ( 252 -- 201 Ma ) : The fish fauna of the Triassic was remarkably uniform , reflecting the fact that very few families survived the Permian extinction . A considerable radiation of ray - finned fishes occurred during the Triassic , laying the foundation for many modern fishes . See Category : Triassic fish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Perleidus </Td> <Td> Perleidus was a ray - finned fish from the Early Triassic . About 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) in length , it was a freshwater predatory fish with jaws that hung vertically under the braincase , allowing them to open wide . Perleidus had highly flexible dorsal and anal fins , with a reduced number of fin rays , which would have made the fish more agile in the water . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pachycormiformes </Td> <Td> <P> Pachycormiformes are an extinct order of ray - finned fish that existed from the Middle Triassic to the K - Pg extinction ( below ) . They were characterized by serrated pectoral fins , reduced pelvic fins and a bony rostrum . Their relations with other fish are unclear . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pholidophorus </Td> <Td> Pholidophorus was an extinct genus of teleost , around 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) long , from about 240 -- 140 Ma . Although not closely related to the modern herring , it was somewhat like them . It had a single dorsal fin , a symmetrical tail , and an anal fin placed towards the rear of the body . It had large eyes and was probably a fast swimming predator , hunting planktonic crustaceans and smaller fish . A very early teleost , Pholidophoris had many primitive characteristics such as ganoid scales and a spine that was partially composed of cartilage , rather than bone . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""3""> The Triassic ended with the Triassic -- Jurassic extinction event . About 23 % of all families , 48 % of all genera ( 20 % of marine families and 55 % of marine genera ) and 70 % to 75 % of all species became extinct . Non-dinosaurian archosaurs continued to dominate aquatic environments , while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Jurassic </Th> <Td_colspan=""3""> Jurassic ( 201 -- 145 Ma ) : During the Jurassic period , the primary vertebrates living in the seas were fish and marine reptiles . The latter include ichthyosaurs who were at the peak of their diversity , plesiosaurs , pliosaurs , and marine crocodiles of the families Teleosauridae and Metriorhynchidae . Numerous turtles could be found in lakes and rivers . See Category : Jurassic fish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Leedsichthys </Td> <Td> Along with its close pachycormid relatives Bonnerichthys and Rhinconichthys , Leedsichthys is part of a lineage of large - sized filter - feeders that swam the Mesozoic seas for over 100 million years , from the middle Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous period . Pachycormids might represent an early branch of Teleostei , the group most modern bony fishes belong to ; in that case Leedsichthys is the largest known teleost fish . In 2003 , a fossil specimen 22 meters ( 72 feet ) long was unearthed . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ichthyodectidae </Td> <Td> This fossil Ichthyodectidae from the Lower Jurassic is one of the best conserved fossil fishes worldwide <P> The family Ichthyodectidae ( literally `` fish - biters '' ) was a family of marine actinopterygian fish . They first appeared 156 Ma during the Late Jurassic and disappeared during the K - Pg extinction event 66 Ma . They were most diverse throughout the Cretaceous period . Sometimes classified in the primitive bony fish order Pachycormiformes , they are today generally regarded as members of the `` bulldog fish '' order Ichthyodectiformes in the far more advanced Osteoglossomorpha . Most ichthyodectids ranged between 1 and 5 meters ( 3.3 and 16.4 ft ) in length . All known taxa were predators , feeding on smaller fish ; in several cases , larger Ichthyodectidae preyed on smaller members of the family . Some species had remarkably large teeth , though others , such as Gillicus arcuatus , had small ones and sucked in their prey . The largest Xiphactinus was 20 feet long , and appeared in the Late Cretaceous ( below ) . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Cret - aceous </Th> <Td_colspan=""3""> Cretaceous ( 145 -- 66 Ma ) : See Category : Cretaceous fish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Sturgeon </Td> <Td> True sturgeons appear in the fossil record during the Upper Cretaceous . Since that time , sturgeons have undergone remarkably little morphological change , indicating their evolution has been exceptionally slow and earning them informal status as living fossils . This is explained in part by the long generation interval , tolerance for wide ranges of temperature and salinity , lack of predators due to size , and the abundance of prey items in the benthic environment . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Cretoxyrhina </Td> <Td> <P> Cretoxyrhina mantelli was a large shark that lived about 100 to 82 million years ago , during the mid Cretaceous period . It is commonly known as the Ginsu Shark . This shark was first identified by a famous Swiss Naturalist , Louis Agassiz in 1843 , as Cretoxyhrina mantelli . However , the most complete specimen of this shark was discovered in 1890 , by the fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg , who published his findings in 1907 . The specimen consisted of a nearly complete associated vertebral column and over 250 associated teeth . This kind of exceptional preservation of fossil sharks is rare because a shark 's skeleton is made of cartilage , which is not prone to fossilization . Charles dubbed the specimen Oxyrhina mantelli . This specimen represented a 20 - foot - long ( 6.1 m ) shark . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Enchodus </Td> <Td> <P> Enchodus is an extinct genus of bony fish . It flourished during the Upper Cretaceous and was small to medium in size . One of the genus ' most notable attributes are the large `` fangs '' at the front of the upper and lower jaws and on the palatine bones , leading to its misleading nickname among fossil hunters and paleoichthyologists , `` the saber - toothed herring '' . These fangs , along with a long sleek body and large eyes , suggest Enchodus was a predatory species . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Xiphactinus </Td> <Td> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Xiphactinus -- YouTube </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Xiphactinus is an extinct genus of large predatory marine bony fish of the Late Cretaceous .

Ptychodus mortoni ( pictured ) was about 32 feet ( 9.8 metres ) long and was unearthed in Kansas , United States . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""3""> The end of the Cretaceous was marked by the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event ( K - Pg extinction ) . There are substantial fossil records of jawed fishes across the K -- T boundary , which provides good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates . Within cartilaginous fish , approximately 80 % of the sharks , rays , and skates families survived the extinction event , and more than 90 % of teleost fish ( bony fish ) families survived . There is evidence of a mass kill of bony fishes at a fossil site immediately above the K -- T boundary layer on Seymour Island near Antarctica , apparently precipitated by the K -- Pg extinction event . However , the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event , and evidence shows that there was a major increase in size and abundance of teleosts immediately after the extinction , apparently due to the elimination of their ammonite competitors ( there was no similar change in shark populations across the boundary ) . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Cenozoic Era </Th> <Td_colspan=""3""> Cenozoic Era ( 66 Ma to present ) : The current era has seen great diversification of bony fishes . Over half of all living vertebrate species ( about 32,000 species ) are fishes ( non-tetrapod craniates ) , a diverse set of lineages that inhabit all the world 's aquatic ecosystems , from snow minnows ( Cypriniformes ) in Himalayan lakes at elevations over 4,600 metres ( 15,100 feet ) to flatfishes ( order Pleuronectiformes ) in the Challenger Deep , the deepest ocean trench at about 11,000 metres ( 36,000 feet ) . Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world 's water bodies , both freshwater and marine . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Amphistium </Td> <Td> Amphistium is a 50 - million - year - old fossil fish that has been identified as an early relative of the flatfish , and as a transitional fossil . In a typical modern flatfish , the head is asymmetric with both eyes on one side of the head . In Amphistium , the transition from the typical symmetric head of a vertebrate is incomplete , with one eye placed near the top of the head . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Megalodon </Td> <Td> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Megalodon Giant Shark -- National Geographic ( full documentary ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Megalodon battle History Channel </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> The Nightmarish Megalodon Discovery </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Megalodon is an extinct species of shark that lived about 28 to 1.5 Ma . It looked much like a stocky version of the great white shark , but was much larger with fossil lengths reaching 20.3 metres ( 67 ft ) .

Before settling on their current name in 1982 , the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man . Bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest remaining members of the band , having been involved with Faith No More since its inception . The band underwent several lineup changes early in their career , along with some major changes later on . The current lineup of Faith No More consists of Gould , Bordin , keyboardist / rhythm guitarist Roddy Bottum , lead guitarist Jon Hudson and vocalist / lyricist Mike Patton . </P> <P> After releasing six studio albums , including their best - selling records The Real Thing ( 1989 ) and Angel Dust ( 1992 ) , Faith No More officially announced their breakup on April 20 , 1998 . They have since reunited , embarked on The Second Coming Tour from 2009 to 2012 , and released their seventh studio album , Sol Invictus , in May 2015 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early days ( 1979 -- 1984 ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself ( 1985 -- 1988 ) </Li> <Li> 1.3 Mike Patton joins and The Real Thing ( 1989 -- 1991 ) </Li> <Li> 1.4 Angel Dust ( 1992 -- 1994 ) </Li> <Li> 1.5 King for a Day ... , Album of the Year and break - up ( 1995 -- 1998 ) </Li> <Li> 1.6 Reformation ( 2009 -- 2012 ) </Li> <Li> 1.7 Sol Invictus and hiatus ( 2015 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Musical style and influences </Li> <Li> 3 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Concert tours </Li> <Li> 5 Members </Li> <Li> 6 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 7 Discography </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Notes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early days ( 1979 -- 1984 ) ( edit ) </H3> Vocalist Chuck Mosley joined Faith No More in 1983 , and during his five - year tenure with the band , he appeared on their first two studio albums . <P> Faith No More was originally formed as Sharp Young Men in 1979 by bassist Billy Gould , drummer Mike Bordin , vocalist Mike Morris , and keyboardist Wade Worthington . Mike Morris described the name as `` a piss - take on all the ' elegant ' groups at the time . '' Later on , Morris proposed the name Faith In No Man , but , eventually , the band settled on Bordin 's suggestion Faith No Man ( stylized as Faith . No Man ) . </P> The band 's classic logo , used on their 1985 debut We Care a Lot . It was originally designed by Billy Gould as an homage to the Symbol of Chaos . <P> They recorded `` Quiet in Heaven / Song of Liberty '' , released in 1983 . The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace 's parents ' garage , where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men , with Mike Morris , Billy Gould , Mike Bordin and Wade Worthington . Worthington left shortly thereafter . They changed their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single , which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace 's garage , and hired Roddy Bottum to replace Worthington . Bottum , Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More . They chose the name to accentuate the fact that `` The Man '' ( Mike Morris ) was `` No More '' . They did n't have any constant guitarists or vocalists until they eventually settled on Chuck Mosley in 1983 and later Jim Martin . </P> <H3> We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself ( 1985 -- 1988 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the name change , the band initially started recording We Care a Lot without backing from a record label and , after pooling their money , recorded five songs . This gained the attention of Ruth Schwartz , who was then forming the independent label Mordam Records , under which the band , after getting the necessary financial support , finished and released the album . It was the first official release for both the band and the label . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Why Do You Bother '' ( 1985 ) 30 second sample of the We Care a Lot song `` Why Do You Bother '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Problems playing this file ?

The label had recently been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records , ensuring a widespread release for the band 's following albums . Introduce Yourself was released in 1987 , and a revamped version of their debut album 's title track `` We Care a Lot '' saw minor success on MTV . Mosley 's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic , particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988 . Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage , the release party for the album Introduce Yourself -- during which he fell asleep on stage -- and one of Mosley 's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour . Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe . Billy Gould reflected `` There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal , and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs . It was just so far off the mark . The upshot was that I got up , walked out and quit the band . I Just said : ' I 'm done -- I ca n't take this any longer . It 's just so ridiculous ' . The same day , I talked to Bordin , and he said : ' Well , I still want to play with you ' . Bottum did the same thing . It was another one of these ' firing somebody without firing them ' scenarios .

Patton , who was singing with his high school band , Mr. Bungle , was recruited at Martin 's suggestion after he heard a demo of Mr. Bungle . According to Patton , he first met the band during a 1986 gig at `` a pizza parlour '' in his hometown of Eureka , California . Two weeks after joining Faith No More , he had written all the lyrics for the songs that would make up the Grammy award - nominated The Real Thing . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Epic '' ( 1989 ) 30 second sample from Faith No More 's `` Epic '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Problems playing this file ?

The music video for `` Epic '' received extensive airplay on MTV in 1990 , despite anger from animal rights activists for a slow motion shot of a fish flopping out of water . That same year , Faith No More performed at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards ( September 6 ) and on the 293rd episode of Saturday Night Live ( December 1 ) `` From Out of Nowhere '' and `` Falling to Pieces '' saw releases as singles , and a cover of Black Sabbath 's `` War Pigs '' was also produced for non-vinyl releases . In 1990 , the band went on an extensive US tour , sending The Real Thing to Platinum status in Canada , the US , and South America . The album also had big sales numbers in Australia , UK , and the rest of Europe , pushing the total sales well above 4 million worldwide . </P> Vocalist Mike Patton joined Faith No More in 1988 , replacing Chuck Mosley . <P> In February 1991 , Faith No More released their only official live album , Live at the Brixton Academy . The album also included two previously unreleased studio tracks , `` The Grade '' and `` The Cowboy Song '' . That same year , the band contributed a track for the motion picture soundtrack to Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey with the song `` The Perfect Crime '' . Jim Martin also made a brief cameo in the film as `` Sir James Martin '' as the head of the `` Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center '' . Mike Patton 's original band Mr. Bungle would go on to sign with Slash / London 's parent label Warner Bros. Records in 1991 , following the worldwide success of The Real Thing . </P> <H3> Angel Dust ( 1992 -- 1994 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Faith No More displayed an even more experimental effort on their next album , Angel Dust . One critic writes that the album is `` one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label '' and another writes that the single `` ' A Small Victory ' , which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers ( ... ) reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions . '' </P> <P> Aside from `` A Small Victory '' ( which received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards ) , the tracks `` Midlife Crisis '' and `` Everything 's Ruined '' were also released as singles . The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy , and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores `` Easy '' , which in some parts of the world became the band 's biggest hit . Angel Dust , though not as successful as The Real Thing in the US , sold 665,000 copies there , and managed to outsell The Real Thing in many other countries . In Germany , the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies . The album also matched the sales of The Real Thing in Canada ( Platinum ) , Australia ( Gold ) , and surpassed it in the Netherlands , France , Russia , and the UK . Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Midlife Crisis '' ( 1992 ) 30 second sample from Faith No More 's `` MidLife Crisis '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=""2""> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1993 , long - time guitarist Jim Martin left the band due to internal conflicts . He was reportedly unhappy with the band 's change in musical direction on Angel Dust , describing it as `` gay disco '' . According to Roddy Bottum , Martin was fired via fax . However , Martin himself states it was his decision to leave . Both Godflesh guitarist Justin Broadrick and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker were reportedly offered to join Faith No More after Martin 's departure , but declined to join . The position was filled by Mike Patton 's bandmate from Mr. Bungle , Trey Spruance , who left soon after recording 1995 's King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime and just before the band was to begin their world tour . Spruance was replaced by Dean Menta , the band 's keyboard tech . </P> <H3> King for a Day ... , album of the Year and break - up ( 1995 -- 1998 ) ( edit ) </H3> The alternate `` barking dog logo '' , based on the artwork for Faith No More 's 1995 album King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime <P> 1995 's King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime varies greatly from song to song in style ; post-hardcore / punk , country , jazz , bossa nova , thrash metal , gospel music , along with other signature FNM elements , are woven together throughout the album . Singles included `` Digging the Grave '' , `` Evidence '' , and `` Ricochet '' . The album featured Mr. Bungle 's Trey Spruance on guitar . The record went Gold in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , Netherlands and Germany , which gave the album a respectable sales figure of around 1.5 million copies ; this was significantly lower than sales of their previous albums . A 7 x 7 - inch box set of singles was released , which included the B - sides and some interviews between the songs . </P> <P> Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist , Jon Hudson , who was a former roommate of Billy Gould . The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries ( for example , in Germany , the album debuted at No. 2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months ) . In Australia , Album of the Year went to No. 1 and was certified Platinum . The album charted in many countries in Europe . To date , Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide . The singles `` Ashes to Ashes '' and `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' had minimal success ( notably , the music video for `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' , which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh , was inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo ) . `` Stripsearch '' was released as a single in various countries ( excluding the US and UK ) . The album received largely negative reviews from US - based critics at the time . Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review `` ( They ) are floundering around desperately , groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant '' , while Pitchfork Media stated `` Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night 's used condom -- sure , the ride was fun while it lasted , but what remains is just plain icky . And you definitely do n't want it in your CD player .

Starting with a rumor posted to the Faith No More newsgroup alt. music. faith - no - more claiming Mike Patton had quit the band in favor of side projects , this rumor , although denied at the time , proved to be at least partly true . Faith No More played their last show in Lisbon , Portugal on April 7 , 1998 . The band cancelled their planned support tour for Aerosmith and on April 20 , Billy Gould released a statement by email and fax , saying `` ( T ) he decision among the members is mutual '' and `` the split will now enable each member to pursue his individual project ( s ) unhindered . '' The band `` thank ( ed ) all of those fans and associates that have stuck with and supported the band throughout its history . '' </P> <P> Immediately after the dissolution of Faith No More , the members went on to numerous different projects . Mike Patton notably co-founded the supergroups Fantômas and Tomahawk in 1998 - 99 , as well as continuing his original band Mr. Bungle , who were still signed with Warner Bros. Records . The sound of Tomahawk in particular has often been compared to Faith No More 's mid-late 1990s output . </P> <P> When Faith No More was brought up in a 1999 interview with The A.V. Club , Patton ( then fronting Mr. Bungle ) stated `` I 'm definitely glad it 's over : It was a great thing while it lasted , but it really had to end . I think if it had continued it would have gotten really ugly . No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that , but the music would have been substandard . So the line must be drawn there . '' In another interview from 2001 , he similarly stated that the band had broken up `` because we were starting to make bad music . '' However , Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton on the quality of the band 's late material , stating in 1998 `` However many records we sold or did n't , we maintained over a long period of time a high standard of music that we 're proud of , and we never sucked . Whatever shit that happened to us on the way , thank God it did n't get in the way of the music . '' </P> <H3> Reformation ( 2009 -- 2012 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for shows in the UK in the summer of 2009 were circulating in late November 2008 , but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould . He explained : `` If anything like this were to happen , it would have to come from the band , and I have n't spoken with any of them in over a year . So as far as I know , there is n't anything to talk about , and I 'm pretty sure that if you were to contact Patton , he would tell you the same thing . '' </P> <P> However , on February 24 , 2009 after months of speculation and rumors , Faith No More announced they would be reforming with a line - up identical to the Album of the Year era , embarking on a reunion tour called The Second Coming Tour . To coincide with the band 's reunion tour , Rhino released the sixth Faith No More compilation , The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection , a double album that includes their hit singles and b sides & rarities , in the UK on June 8 . Faith No More then played in major European festivals including Download Festival in the UK in June , Hurricane and Southside festivals in Germany , Greenfield Festival in Switzerland , Hove Festival in Norway and Roskilde Festival in Denmark , among other dates . The tour continued into 2010 with appearances at the Soundwave Festival in Australian cities throughout February and March . During their tour , the band added covers to their repertoire including `` Switch '' by Siouxsie and the Banshees . </P> <P> After an eleven - month hiatus , Faith No More played four shows in South America in November 2011 . On the first date ( November 8 , 2011 ) , the band played a `` mystery song , '' which led to speculation of new material . They played Sonisphere France on July 7 , 2012 . Following several more shows in Europe during 2012 , Faith No More became temporarily inactive again . Mike Patton spent 2013 touring with his reformed rock supergroup Tomahawk , while the band 's other members also pursued their own side projects . In July 2013 , Billy Gould confirmed that the band 's hiatus would not be permanent , saying `` We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that , and ready for the challenge . This is not the time ... yet .

'' On July 4 , Faith No More played their first show in two years at Hyde Park in London , supporting Black Sabbath . At that show , Faith No More debuted two new songs `` Motherfucker '' and `` Superhero '' ( also known by fans as `` Leader of Men '' ) . On August 20 , the band posted `` The Reunion Tour is over ; in 2015 things are going to change . '' These tweets led to speculation that the band was working on new material . On August 30 , Gould said that the band is `` considering doing something new '' , and may begin work on a new studio album at some point in the not - too - distant future , explaining , `` to do something creative would be a really good thing to do . '' On September 2 , Bill Gould revealed to Rolling Stone that the band had begun work on a new album . Faith No More headlined the final edition of Australia 's Soundwave in February and March 2015 . The band released their seventh studio album , Sol Invictus , in May 2015 . The songs on the album were influenced by The Cramps , Link Wray and Siouxsie and the Banshees . Speaking to Revolver , Gould described the song `` Cone of Shame '' as `` blues - based rock and roll '' . Describing the song `` Matador '' , he said : `` parts of it remind me of the first Siouxsie and the Banshees album . We used real pianos and that brings this organic quality to it to the music '' . The second single from the album , `` Superhero '' , was shared by the band on March 1 , 2015 . </P> <P> In a June 2016 interview , guitarist Jon Hudson stated that he has been `` working on a few ideas '' for the next Faith No More album , and added that `` it 's something that ( he ) wanted to focus on after the tour ended . '' When asked about the prospect of more music from Faith No More , Patton told Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald , `` I do n't know whether or not we 're going to attack it , but there is some stuff we wrote around the time of the last one and said , ' Why do n't we save this for the next record ? ' . So we 'll see . '' </P> <P> In August 2016 , the band performed two concerts with former lead singer Chuck Mosley to celebrate the reissue of their debut album We Care a Lot . The band was billed as `` Chuck Mosley & Friends '' for the two shows and featured the lineup of Mosley , Mike Bordin , Billy Gould , Jon Hudson and Roddy Bottum . </P> <P> In a September 2017 interview on Full Metal Jackie Radio , Patton revealed that Faith No More has been `` on an extended break . '' He added that he does not rule out more shows with the band , explaining , `` If something happens , it 'll happen organically and naturally . But I kind of do n't think it will . I kind of feel like we 've tipped the scales a little bit . But we 'll see . Who knows ? I 've learned my lesson not to say ' no . ' '' </P> <P> Former Faith No More singer Chuck Mosley died on November 9 , 2017 , due to `` the disease of addiction . '' He was 57 years old . </P> <H2> Musical style and influences ( edit ) </H2> <P> While Faith No More 's music is generally considered as alternative metal , experimental rock , and funk metal , as Faith No Man , their sound was described as post-punk . The band 's first single from 1983 , `` Quiet in Heaven / Song of Liberty '' , was labelled as a `` solid post-punk / pre-goth single . '' During their tenure with Chuck Mosley in the mid-1980s , Billy Gould stated the band were in a `` weird spot '' , as their eclectic sound did n't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era . Upon Mike Patton 's arrival in 1989 , the band began to expand their sound range even further , merging disparate genres such as synthpop , thrash metal and carousel music on The Real Thing . Rolling Stone states that during the 1990s , the band were `` too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind ( and ) too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle - draggers they spawned . '' Over the course of their career , they have experimented with heavy metal , funk , hip hop , progressive rock , alternative rock , hardcore punk , polka , easy listening , jazz , samba , ska , bossa nova , hard rock , pop , soul , gospel , and lounge music . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Ugly in the Morning '' ( 1995 ) 30 second sample of the King for a Day ...

See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Faith No More 's lyrics have been described as `` bizarrely humorous '' . When interviewed about his lyrics , Patton responded , `` I think that too many people think too much about my lyrics . I am more a person who works more with the sound of a word than with its meaning . Often I just choose the words because of the rhythm , not because of the meaning '' . </P> <P> Bordin acknowledged certain bands as early influences , including Killing Joke , PiL , Black Sabbath , and Theatre of Hate , and upon reforming , Faith No More returned to their early post-punk / goth influences on Sol Invictus . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> In a 2015 article by Artistdirect , Duff McKagan , Chino Moreno , Serj Tankian , Corey Taylor , Max Cavalera and Jonathan Davis praised the band for their significance and influence . Nirvana bassist , and co-founder , Krist Novoselic cited Faith No More as a band that `` paved the way for Nirvana '' in the late 1980s . Robert Plant , singer of Led Zeppelin , mentioned the then Chuck Mosley - led Faith No More as one of his current favorite bands in a 1988 interview with Rolling Stone . Plant and Faith No More subsequently toured together following The Real Thing 's release . Scott Ian of Anthrax has also named Faith No More as one of his favorite bands . </P> <P> Corey Taylor ( frontman for both Slipknot and Stone Sour ) told Loudwire in 2015 that if it was n't for Faith No More , he `` would n't be here today . '' While recovering from an attempted suicide at his grandmother 's house , he saw the band perform `` Epic '' live on the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the performance inspired him to begin writing and performing music again . </P> <P> They were voted No. 52 on VH1 's `` 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock '' . The band is credited for inventing the alternative metal genre which began in the 1980s and that fuses metal with other genres , including alternative rock . Tim Grierson of about.com said the band `` helped put alternative metal on the map . '' Faith No More has also been credited for influencing nu metal bands , such as Limp Bizkit , Korn , and Sevendust , primarily due to the popularity of `` Epic '' , and other early material that featured rap and rock crossovers . Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix , a self - confessed fan of the band , stated in a 2015 interview `` They fused some of that hip - hop and rock together . They were one of the earliest bands to do that , and definitely pioneers to a whole genre . If you listen to Korn , if you listen to how the bass and the drums lock up , it 's quite similar to how Faith No More was doing it in their early years . '' </P> <P> Faith No More have been covered by prominent metal acts such as 36 Crazyfists , Apocalyptica , Atreyu , Between the Buried and Me , Disturbed , Five Finger Death Punch , Helloween , Ill Niño , Korn , Machine Head , Papa Roach , Redemption , Revocation , Sentenced , Slaves on Dope and Trail of Tears . In 2002 , a tribute album titled Tribute of the Year ( a reference to Faith No More 's Album of the Year ) was released by Underground Inc . It featured 30 Faith No More songs covered by mostly unknown independent hardcore , industrial and alternative metal acts . </P> <P> The band and their 1989 single `` Epic '' have frequently been cited as an example of an ' 80s or ' 90s one - hit wonder . Flavorwire stated in 2014 `` Although the band always had a loyal fan base and Patton remains an indie hero , they only cracked the Billboard Hot 100 once , with Epic . '' Others have noted that after `` Epic '' 's success , the band still managed to remain highly popular in regions outside North America : including Australia , South America , Europe and the UK . The band 's original final record Album of the Year notably experienced high sales in countries such as Australia ( where it went platinum ) , New Zealand and Germany , while being deemed a critical and commercial failure in their native USA . </P> <H3> Relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Anthony Kiedis § Feud with Mike Patton <P> After the release of The Real Thing , Faith No More developed somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers , whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour . Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his `` style '' in the `` Epic '' music video . He told Kerrang ! magazine `` My drummer says he 's gon na kidnap ( Patton ) , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet , just so he 'll be forced to find a style of his own '' . In a separate interview , he clarified his comment , remarking `` I love The Real Thing , and I liked his vocals on that record . I mean , when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities , but when I saw that video it was like , ' Wait a second here , what the fuck ? . ' '' Roddy Bottum responded by saying `` To me , our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers . If you 're talking about long hair , rapping with his shirt off , then yeah , I can see similarities . But beyond that , I ca n't see any . I have n't talked to them since this whole thing started . We 're really good friends with that band and i 'd like to think they 're doing it ... like as a favour '' . Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990 , commenting that `` It just kind of came out of the blue . It does n't bother me a bit . I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth . I mean , if he 's gon na talk about me in interviews , that 's fine - it 's free press ! Either he 's feeling inadequate or old or I do n't know , but I have no reason to talk shit about him . '' Later in 2001 , Patton also theorized that `` I think Anthony , deep down , feels like I 'm a better dancer than he is . I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does . And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me . Maybe one day we 'll have a breakoff , just breakdance . '' </P> <P> Following a period of silence , the feud between Patton and Kiedis quickly escalated again in 1999 with Patton 's other band Mr. Bungle , culminating in an infamous Halloween show during 1999 in which Patton ( dressed as Kiedis ) and his bandmates parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers and their hit singles . The performance was in response to getting kicked off a series of lucrative festival gigs shared with Red Hot Chili Peppers , due to Kiedis 's staunch refusal to perform with Mike Patton . </P> <P> Despite this , other members of both groups appear to have remained on good terms since the initial controversy . Regarding the perceived conflict , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated `` There was never any fight between us , that was a bunch of bullshit created by the media . I mean I think they 're a good band . Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer ( Patton ) , but it all means nothing to me . Those guys in the band are nice people and there 's no fight . '' At a 2014 show in Brooklyn , the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley - era song `` We Care a Lot '' . </P> <P> Fox News commentator Greg Gutfeld attracted media attention in 2016 when he stated `` You 're either a Faith No More fan , or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan . You can not love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis , because they are two different people . You have to love Mike Patton , you can not love Anthony Kiedis . So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe , because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe .

It primarily focuses on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers , dealers and importers . </P> <P> The GCA was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22 , 1968 , and is Title I of the U.S. federal firearms laws . The National Firearms Act of 1934 ( NFA ) is Title II . Both GCA and NFA are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Prohibited persons </Li> <Li> 3 Federal Firearms License ( FFL ) system <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Gunsmith and Factory Repair Exception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Import restrictions </Li> <Li> 5 Marking requirements </Li> <Li> 6 Commentary </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Passage of the Gun Control Act was initially prompted by the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963 . The President was shot and killed with a rifle purchased by mail - order from an ad in the magazine American Rifleman . Congressional hearings followed and a ban on mail - order gun sales was discussed , but no law was passed until 1968 . At the hearings NRA Executive Vice-President Franklin Orth supported a ban on mail - order sales , stating , `` We do not think that any sane American , who calls himself an American , can object to placing into this bill the instrument which killed the president of the United States . '' </P> <P> Precursors of the passage of the Gun Control Act were Senate Bill 1975 in 1963 , `` A Bill to Regulate the Interstate Shipment of Firearms , '' and Senate Bill 1592 in 1965 , `` A Bill to Amend the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 . '' Both were introduced by Senator Thomas J. Dodd and met with fierce opposition on the floor but the bills also paved the way for the creation of the Gun Control Act of 1968 . </P> <P> The deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy in June 1968 , along with fears of armed uprising in black cities , renewed efforts to pass the bill . On June 11 , 1968 , a tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee halted the bill 's passage . On reconsideration nine days later , the bill was passed by the committee . The Senate Judiciary Committee similarly brought the bill to a temporary halt , but as in the House , it was passed on reconsideration . House Resolution 17735 , known as the Gun Control Act , was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22 , 1968 banning mail order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons , drug users and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns . </P> <H2> Prohibited persons ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Gun Control Act of 1968 was enhanced in 1993 with the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act . The Brady Act created a background check system which required licensed sellers to inspect the criminal history background of prospective gun purchasers , and the Brady Act created a list of categories of individuals to whom the sale of firearms is prohibited . As quoted from 18 U.S.C. 922 ( d ) : </P> <P> It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person -- ( 1 ) is under indictment for , or has been convicted in any court of , a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ; ( 2 ) is a fugitive from justice ; ( 3 ) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance ( as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 802 ) ) ; ( 4 ) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution ; ( 5 ) who , being an alien -- ( A ) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States ; or ( B ) except as provided in subsection ( y ) ( 2 ) , has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa ( as that term is defined in section 101 ( a ) ( 26 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 8 U.S.C. 1101 ( a ) ( 26 ) ) ) ; ( 6 ) who ( 2 ) has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions ; ( 7 ) who , having been a citizen of the United States , has renounced his citizenship ; ( 8 ) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing , stalking , or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person , or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child , except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that -- ( A ) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice , and at which such person had the opportunity to participate ; and ( B ) ( i ) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child ; or ( ii ) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use , attempted use , or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury ; or ( 9 ) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence . </P> <P> Exceptions as quoted from 18 U.S.C. 921 ( a ) ( 33 ) ( B ) : </P> <P> ( ii ) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or set aside , or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ( if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense ) unless the pardon , expungement , or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship , transport , possess , or receive firearms . </P> <P> Many states automatically reinstate gun ownership rights upon completion of sentence . Some states reinstate rights depending on the crime convicted of , and others have a petition process . Those convicted of a federal offense must contact the Office of the Pardon Attorney , Department of Justice , to receive a presidential pardon . Under the Department 's rules governing petitions for executive clemency , 28 C.F.R. § § 1.1 et seq. , an applicant must satisfy a minimum waiting period of five years before he becomes eligible to apply for a presidential pardon of his federal conviction . </P> <P> According to a 21 Sep 2011 `` Open Letter to All Federal Firearms Licensees '' from ATF , holders of state - issued medical marijuana cards are automatically `` prohibited persons '' under 18 U.S.C 922 ( g ) ( 3 ) and `` shipping , transporting , receiving or possessing firearms or ammunition '' by a medical marijuana card holder is a violation . </P> <P> Additionally , 18 U.S.C 922 ( x ) generally prohibits persons under 18 years of age from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition with certain exceptions for employment , target practice , education , and a handgun possessed while defending the home of the juvenile or a home in which they are an invited guest . </P> <P> The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) to prevent firearms sales to such prohibited persons . </P> <H2> Federal firearms license ( FFL ) system ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Federal Firearms License <P> The Gun Control Act mandated the licensing of individuals and companies engaged in the business of selling firearms . This provision effectively prohibited the direct mail order of firearms ( except antique firearms ) by consumers and mandated that anyone who wants to buy a gun in an interstate transaction from a source other than a private individual must do so through a federally licensed firearms dealer . The Act also banned unlicensed individuals from acquiring handguns outside their state of residence . The interstate purchase of long guns ( rifles and shotguns ) was not impeded by the Act so long as the seller is federally licensed and such a sale is allowed by both the state of purchase and the state of residence . </P> <P> Private sales between residents of two different states are also prohibited without going through a licensed dealer , except for the case of a buyer holding a Curio & Relic license purchasing a firearm that qualifies as a curio or relic . </P> <P> Private sales between unlicensed individuals who are residents of the same state are allowed under federal law so long as such transfers do not violate the other existing federal and state laws . While current law mandates that a background check be performed if the seller has a federal firearms license , private parties living in the same state are not required to perform such checks under federal law . </P> <P> A person who does not have a Federal Firearms License may not be in the business of buying or selling firearms . Individuals buying and selling firearms without a federal license must be doing so from their own personal collection . </P> <P> Under the Gun Control Act , a federally licensed importer , manufacturer , dealer or collector shall not sell or deliver any rifle or shotgun or ammunition for rifle or shotgun to any individual less than 18 years of age , nor any handgun or ammunition for a handgun to any individual less than 21 years of age . </P> <H3> Gunsmith and factory repair exception ( edit ) </H3> <P> While the Gun Control Act prohibits the direct mail - ordering of firearms , a person may ship a gun via contract carrier ( such as United Parcel Service - UPS , United States Postal Service or FedEx ) to a gunsmith ( who has an FFL ) or the gunmaker 's factory for repairs or modification . After the repair work is done , the gunsmith or the factory can ship the gun directly back to the customer . </P> <H2> Import restrictions ( edit ) </H2> ATF Form 4590 ( `` Factoring Criteria for Weapons '' ) <P> The GCA created what is known as the `` sporting purposes '' standard for imported firearms , saying that they must `` be generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes . '' GCA sporting purposes includes hunting and organized competitive target shooting , but does not include `` plinking '' or `` practical shooting '' ( which the ATF says is closer to police / combat - style competition and not comparable to more traditional types of sports ) , nor does it allow for collection for historical or design interest . </P> <H2> Marking requirements ( edit ) </H2> <P> The law also required that all newly manufactured firearms produced by licensed manufacturers in the United States and imported into the United States bear a serial number . Firearms manufactured prior to the Gun Control Act and firearms manufactured by non-FFLs remain exempt from the serial number requirement . Defacement or removal of the serial number ( if present ) is a felony offense . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Commentary ( edit ) </H2> <P> In a June 1966 essay , Neal Knox wrote that what was then called the Dodd Bill was opposed by outdoorsmen and conservationists Harry R. Woodward , C.R. Gutermuth of the Wildlife Management Institute , Richard H. Stroud of the Sport Fishing Institute , Howard Carter Jr. of the National Shooting Sports Foundation , E.C. Hadley of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute , Robert T. Dennis of the Izaak Walton League , `` and countless other sportsmen , and sportsmen and industry groups '' because it would have a far - reaching and damaging effect on the hunting and shooting sports , while failing to reduce crime . </P> <P> In his remarks upon signing the act in October 1968 , Johnson said : </P> <P> Congress adopted most of our recommendations . But this bill -- as big as this bill is -- still falls short , because we just could not get the Congress to carry out the requests we made of them . I asked for the national registration of all guns and the licensing of those who carry those guns . For the fact of life is that there are over 160 million guns in this country -- more firearms than families . If guns are to be kept out of the hands of the criminal , out of the hands of the insane , and out of the hands of the irresponsible , then we just must have licensing . If the criminal with a gun is to be tracked down quickly , then we must have registration in this country . The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation . They were the voices of a powerful lobby , a gun lobby , that has prevailed for the moment in an election year . </P> <P> At the time of its passage in 1968 , NRA executive vice president Franklin Orth wrote in American Rifleman that `` the measure as a whole appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can live with '' . </P> <P> In the May 1993 issue of Guns & Ammo magazine , Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership ( JPFO ) compared the GCA to Nazi gun laws . </P> <P> In a 2011 article noting the death of former U.S. Senator James A. McClure , the NRA called provisions of the GCA `` draconian . '' McClure was cosponsor of the Firearm Owners Protection Act ( FOPA ) of 1986 , also called the McClure - Volkmer Act . </P> <P> Political scientist Robert Spitzer wrote in 2011 that the Gun Control Act of 1968 `` provides an ideal case study to highlight the political processes affecting a direct effort to regulate firearms . '' He also stated in his book that President Johnson 's proposal called for national registration of all guns as well as licensing for all gun carriers , but his influence over the enacted law was small . House Rules Committee chair William Colmer only released H.R. 177735 to the floor after Judiciary Committee chair Emanuel Celler promised to oppose efforts to add licensing and registration provisions . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Gun law in the United States </Li> <Li> Gun politics in the United States </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Michaud , Jon ( April 19 , 2012 ) . `` The Birth of the Modern Gun Debate '' .

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 , and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818 , when she was 20 . Her name first appeared on the second edition , published in France in 1823 . </P> <P> Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814 , journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) away from Frankenstein Castle , where , two centuries before , an alchemist was engaged in experiments . Later , she travelled in the region of Geneva ( Switzerland ) -- where much of the story takes place -- and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions , particularly her lover and future husband , Percy Shelley . Mary , Percy , Lord Byron and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story . After thinking for days , Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made ; her dream later evolved into the novel 's story . </P> <P> Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement . At the same time , it is an early example of science fiction . Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because , in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction , the central character `` makes a deliberate decision '' and `` turns to modern experiments in the laboratory '' to achieve fantastic results . It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories , films and plays . </P> <P> Since the novel 's publication , the name `` Frankenstein '' has often been used to refer to the monster itself . This usage is sometimes considered erroneous , but usage commentators regard it as well - established and acceptable . In the novel , the monster is identified by words such as `` creature '' , `` monster '' , `` demon '' , `` wretch '' , `` abortion '' , `` fiend '' and `` it '' . Speaking to Victor Frankenstein , the wretch refers to himself as `` the Adam of your labours '' , and elsewhere as someone who `` would have ( been ) your Adam '' , but is instead `` your fallen angel '' ( which ties to Lucifer in Paradise Lost , which the monster reads , and which relates to the disobedience of Prometheus in the book 's subtitle ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Summary <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Captain Walton 's Introductory Frame Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.2 Victor Frankenstein 's Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.3 The Creature 's Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.4 Victor Frankenstein 's Narrative Resumes </Li> <Li> 1.5 Captain Walton 's Concluding Frame Narrative </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Characters </Li> <Li> 3 Composition </Li> <Li> 4 Publication </Li> <Li> 5 Frankenstein and the Monster <Ul> <Li> 5.1 The Creature </Li> <Li> 5.2 Victor Frankenstein 's Surname </Li> <Li> 5.3 Victor Frankenstein 's Given Name </Li> <Li> 5.4 Modern Prometheus </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Shelley 's sources </Li> <Li> 7 Reception </Li> <Li> 8 Derivative works </Li> <Li> 9 Films , plays and television </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 Notes </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 Further reading <Ul> <Li> 13.1 Editions <Ul> <Li> 13.1. 1 1818 text </Li> <Li> 13.1. 2 1831 text </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Summary </H2> A variety of different editions <P> Frankenstein is written in the form of a frame story that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister . It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century , as the letters ' dates are given as `` 17 -- '' . </P> <H3> Captain Walton 's introductory frame narrative </H3> <P> The novel Frankenstein is written in epistolary form , documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister , Margaret Walton Saville . Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame . During the voyage , the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure . A few hours later , the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein . Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton 's crew . Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion ; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him , and recounts a story of his life 's miseries to Walton as a warning . The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein 's narrative . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's narrative </H3> <P> Victor begins by telling of his childhood . Born in Naples , into a wealthy Genevan family , Victor and his brothers , Ernest and William , all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort , are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry . As a young boy , Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders . When Victor is five years old , his parents adopt Elizabeth Lavenza , the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman , with whom Victor later falls in love . During this period , Victor 's parents , Alphonse and Caroline , take in yet another orphan , Justine Moritz , who becomes William 's nanny . </P> <P> Weeks before he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany , his mother dies of scarlet fever ; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief . At the university , he excels at chemistry and other sciences , soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter . Eventually , he undertakes the creation of a humanoid , but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body , Victor makes the Creature tall , about 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) in height and proportionally large . Despite his intentions , the beautiful creation of his dreams is instead hideous , with yellow eyes and skin that barely conceals the muscle tissue and blood vessels underneath . Repulsed by his work , Victor flees and dismisses him when it awakens . While wandering the streets , he meets his childhood friend , Henry Clerval , and takes Henry back to his apartment , fearful of Henry 's reaction if he sees the monster . Victor does not have to deal with that issue , however , because the monster has escaped . </P> <P> Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry . After a four - month recovery , he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William . Upon arriving in Geneva , Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain , leading him to believe his creation is responsible . Justine Moritz , William 's nanny , is convicted of the crime after William 's locket , which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline , is found in her pocket . Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged , as he knows no one would believe his story . </P> <P> Ravaged by grief and guilt , Victor retreats into the mountains . The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale . </P> <H3> The Creature 's narrative </H3> <P> Intelligent and articulate , the Creature relates his first days of life , living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance , which led him to fear and hide from them . While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage , he grew fond of the poor family living there , and discreetly collected firewood for them . Secretly living among the family for months , the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods . When he saw his reflection in a pool , he realized his physical appearance was hideous , and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans . Nevertheless , he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend . Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family , but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home , resulting in the Creature burning the cottage in a fit of rage . He then swore revenge on his creator for bringing him into a world that hated him . He traveled to Victor 's family estate using details from Victor 's journal , murdered William , and framed Justine . </P> <P> The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself . He argues that as a living being , he has a right to happiness . The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness , never to reappear , if Victor grants his request . Should Victor refuse his request , The Creature also threatens to kill Victor 's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him . </P> <P> Fearing for his family , Victor reluctantly agrees . The Creature says he will watch over Victor 's progress . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's narrative resumes </H3> <P> Clerval accompanies him to England , but they separate at Victor 's insistence at Perth , Scotland . Victor suspects that the Creature is following him . Working on the female creature on the Orkney Islands , he is plagued by premonitions of disaster , such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him , but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind . He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature , who had indeed followed Victor , watching through a window . The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again , but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well , and the pair would threaten all humanity . Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will `` be with ( him ) on ( his ) wedding night '' . Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life , believing that the Creature will kill him after finally becoming happy . When Victor lands in Ireland , he is soon imprisoned for Clerval 's murder , as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived , causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison . After being acquitted , Victor returns home with his father , who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father 's fortune . </P> <P> In Geneva , Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death , arming himself with pistols and a dagger . The night following their wedding , Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for `` the fiend '' . While Victor searches the house and grounds , the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death . From the window , Victor sees the Creature , who tauntingly points at Elizabeth 's corpse ; Victor tries to shoot him , but the Creature escapes . After getting back to Geneva , Victor 's father , weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth , dies a few days later . Seeking revenge , Victor pursues the Creature to the North Pole , but collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry . </P> <H3> Captain Walton 's concluding frame narrative </H3> <P> At the end of Victor 's narrative , Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story , closing the frame around Victor 's recounting . A few days after the Creature vanished , the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and multiple crewmen die in the cold , before the rest of Walton 's crew insists on returning south once it is freed . Walton sees Victor 's story as a warning , and decides to turn the ship around . </P> <P> Victor dies shortly thereafter , but not before telling Walton to `` avoid ambition '' . Walton discovers the Creature on his ship , mourning over Victor 's body . The Creature tells Walton that Victor 's death has not brought him peace ; rather , his crimes have left him completely alone . The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence . Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon lost in darkness and distance , never to be seen again . </P> <H2> Characters </H2> <Ul> <Li> Victor Frankenstein - Protagonist and narrator of most of the story .

'' ) <P> `` How I , then a young girl , came to think of , and to dilate upon , so very hideous an idea ? '' -- Mary Shelley </P> <P> During the rainy summer of 1816 , the `` Year Without a Summer '' , the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 . Mary Shelley , aged 18 , and her lover ( and later husband ) Percy Bysshe Shelley , visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in Switzerland . The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned , so the group retired indoors until dawn . </P> <P> Sitting around a log fire at Byron 's villa , the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana , then Byron proposed that they `` each write a ghost story '' . Unable to think of a story , young Mary became anxious : `` Have you thought of a story ? I was asked each morning , and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative . '' During one evening in the middle of summer , the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life . `` Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated '' , Mary noted , `` galvanism had given token of such things '' . It was after midnight before they retired , and unable to sleep , she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her `` waking dream '' . </P> <P> I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together . I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out , and then , on the working of some powerful engine , show signs of life , and stir with an uneasy , half vital motion . Frightful must it be ; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world . </P> <P> In September 2011 , astronomer Donald Olson , after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year , and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars , concluded that her `` waking dream '' took place `` between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. '' on 16 June 1816 , several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story . </P> <P> She began writing what she assumed would be a short story . With Percy Shelley 's encouragement , she expanded the tale into a full - fledged novel . She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment `` when I first stepped out from childhood into life '' . Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half - sister Fanny . This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley 's work . Shelley 's first child died in infancy , and when she began composing Frankenstein in 1816 , she was likely nursing her second child , who would also be dead at Frankenstein 's publication . </P> <P> Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans , and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre ( 1819 ) , the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre . Thus two legendary horror tales originated from the conclave . </P> <P> The group talked about Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment ideas as well . Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly ; however , she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society ( Bennett 36 -- 42 ) . </P> <P> Mary 's and Percy Bysshe Shelley 's manuscripts for the first three - volume edition in 1818 ( written 1816 -- 1817 ) , as well as Mary Shelley 's fair copy for her publisher , are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford . The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004 , and they belong now to the Abinger Collection . In 2008 , the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein , edited by Charles E. Robinson , that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley 's original text with Percy Shelley 's additions and interventions alongside . </P> <H2> Publication </H2> Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell ( 1840 -- 41 ) <P> Shelley completed her writing in April / May 1817 , and Frankenstein ; or , The Modern Prometheus was published on 1 January 1818 by the small London publishing house Lackington , Hughes , Harding , Mavor , & Jones . It was issued anonymously , with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin , her father . It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes , the standard `` triple - decker '' format for 19th - century first editions . </P> <P> The second edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1822 in two volumes ( by G. and W.B. Whittaker ) following the success of the stage play Presumption ; or , the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake . This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book 's author on its title page . </P> <P> On 31 October 1831 , the first `` popular '' edition in one - volume appeared , published by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley . This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley , partially to make the story less radical . It included a lengthy new preface by the author , presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story . This edition is the one most widely published and read now , although a few editions follow the 1818 text . Some scholars prefer the original version , arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley 's vision ( see Anne K. Mellor 's `` Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach '' in the W.W. Norton Critical edition ) . </P> <P> In 2008 , a new edition of the novel , titled The Original Frankenstein , edited by Charles E. Robinson , was published . Robinson examined the original manuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made to it . </P> <H2> Frankenstein and the monster </H2> <H3> The Creature </H3> Main article : Frankenstein 's monster An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish Fenian movement as akin to Frankenstein 's creature , in the wake of the Phoenix Park murders . Illustration from an 1882 issue of Punch <P> Part of Frankenstein 's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name , which causes a lack of identity . Instead it is referred to by words such as `` wretch '' , `` monster '' , `` creature '' , `` demon '' , `` devil '' , `` fiend '' , and `` it '' . When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10 , he addresses it as `` vile insect '' , `` abhorred monster '' , `` fiend '' , `` wretched devil '' , and `` abhorred devil '' . </P> <P> During a telling of Frankenstein , Shelley referred to the creature as `` Adam '' . Shelley was referring to the first man in the Garden of Eden , as in her epigraph : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Did I request thee , Maker , from my clay </Dd> <Dd> To mould Me man ? Did I solicit thee </Dd> <Dd> From darkness to promote me ? <Dl> <Dd> John Milton , Paradise Lost ( X . 743 -- 5 ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity , this description is not entirely consistent with Shelley 's work ; both the use of electricity and the cobbled - together image of Frankenstein 's monster were more the result of James Whale 's popular 1931 film adaptation of the story , and other early motion - picture works based upon the creature . In Shelley 's original work , Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life , and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter , though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous . After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power , Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature 's body ( one anatomical feature at a time , from raw materials supplied by `` the dissecting room and the slaughter - house '' ) , which he then brings to life using his unspecified process . </P> <P> The creature has often been mistakenly called `` Frankenstein '' . In 1908 one author said `` It is strange to note how well - nigh universally the term `` Frankenstein '' is misused , even by intelligent people , as describing some hideous monster `` . Edith Wharton 's The Reef ( 1916 ) describes an unruly child as an `` infant Frankenstein . '' David Lindsay 's `` The Bridal Ornament '' , published in The Rover , 12 June 1844 , mentioned `` the maker of poor Frankenstein . '' After the release of Whale 's cinematic Frankenstein , the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as `` Frankenstein '' . This also occurs in Frankenstein films , including Bride of Frankenstein ( 1935 ) and several subsequent films , as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein . Furthermore , future renditions and adaptations of the story include an evil laboratory assistant Igor or Ygor , who does not actually exist within the original narrative . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's surname </H3> <P> Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dream - vision . Despite her public claims of originality , however , a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley 's actual inspiration . The German name Frankenstein means `` stone of the Franks '' , and it is associated with various places in Germany , including Frankenstein Castle ( Burg Frankenstein ) in Darmstadt , Hesse , and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein , a town in the Palatinate . There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen , Thuringia , and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony . Until 1945 , Ząbkowice Śląskie , now a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship , Poland , was mainly populated by Germans and named Frankenstein in German , and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606 , which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author . Finally , the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia . </P> <P> Radu Florescu argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland . It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist , Conrad Dippel , had experimented with human bodies , and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality . A literary essay by A. J. Day supports Florescu 's position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel . Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley 's ' lost ' journals . According to Jörg Heléne , the ' lost journals ' , as well as Florescu 's claims , can not be verified . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's given name </H3> Main article : Victor Frankenstein <P> A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton , a great influence on Shelley ( a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein and Shelley even has the monster himself read it ) . Milton frequently refers to God as `` the Victor '' in Paradise Lost , and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life . In addition , Shelley 's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost ; indeed , the monster says , after reading the epic poem , that he empathizes with Satan 's role in the story . </P> <P> There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley , Mary 's husband . Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley 's , as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth , Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire . There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley 's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy , who at Eton had `` experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions '' , and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment . </P> <P> Percy Shelley was the first - born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley , 1st Baronet of Castle Goring , and Richard Fitzalan , 10th Earl of Arundel . Victor 's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics . Percy had a sister named Elizabeth ; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth . </P> <P> On 22 February 1815 , Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely , and the baby died two weeks later . Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire , Mary 's stepsister , for a lurid affair . When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment , though the newborn creature approached him , as a child would a parent . The question of Victor 's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book . </P> <H3> Modern Prometheus </H3> <P> The Modern Prometheus is the novel 's subtitle ( though some modern editions now drop the subtitle , mentioning it only in an introduction ) . Prometheus , in later versions of Greek mythology , was the Titan who created mankind at the behest of Zeus . He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it . Prometheus taught man to hunt , read , and heal their sick , but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor - quality offerings from humans , Zeus kept fire from mankind . Prometheus , being the creator , took back the fire from Zeus to give to man . When Zeus discovered this , he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus , where each day an eagle would peck out his liver , only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god . He was intended to suffer alone for eternity , but eventually Heracles ( Hercules ) released him . </P> <P> Prometheus was also a myth told in Latin , but was a very different story . In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water , again a very relevant theme to Frankenstein , as Victor rebels against the laws of nature ( how life is naturally made ) and as a result is punished by his creation . </P> In 1910 , Edison Studios released the first motion - picture adaptation of Shelley 's story . <P> The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein . Victor 's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans . </P> <P> Some have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil , and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat ( fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing ) . </P> <P> Byron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus , and Percy Shelley would soon write his own Prometheus Unbound ( 1820 ) . The term `` Modern Prometheus '' was actually coined by Immanuel Kant in reference to Benjamin Franklin and his experiments with electricity . </P> <H2> Shelley 's sources </H2> <P> Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work , one of which was the Promethean myth from Ovid . The influence of John Milton 's Paradise Lost , and Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , are also clearly evident within the novel . Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein 's character from Humphry Davy 's book Elements of Chemical Philosophy , in which he had written that `` science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative ; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ... '' . References to the French Revolution run through the novel ; a possible source may lie in François - Félix Nogaret ( fr ) 's Le Miroir des événemens actuels , ou la Belle au plus offrant ( 1790 ) : a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life - sized automaton . </P> <P> Within the past thirty years or so , many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers ( now called physical scientists ) with Shelley 's work on account of several notable similarities . Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley 's contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini , who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London and Johann Konrad Dippel , who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans . While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities , she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> Illustration by Theodor von Holst from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition <P> Frankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818 . Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views , along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author . The Belle Assemblee described the novel as `` very bold fiction '' ( 139 ) . The Quarterly Review stated that `` the author has the power of both conception and language '' ( 185 ) . Sir Walter Scott , writing in Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine congratulated `` the author 's original genius and happy power of expression '' ( 620 ) , although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language . The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see `` more productions from this author '' ( 253 ) . On the other hand , the Quarterly Review described it `` a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity '' . </P> <P> In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin , the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley . The British Critic attacks the novel 's flaws as the fault of the author : `` The writer of it is , we understand , a female ; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel ; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex , it is no reason why we should ; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment '' ( 438 ) . The Literary Panorama and National Register attacks the novel as a `` feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin 's novels '' produced by the `` daughter of a celebrated living novelist '' ( 414 ) . Despite the reviews , Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success . It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations -- Mary Shelley saw a production of Presumption ; or The Fate of Frankenstein , a play by Richard Brinsley Peake , in 1823 . A French translation appeared as early as 1821 ( Frankenstein : ou le Prométhée Moderne , translated by Jules Saladin ) . </P> <P> Critical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid-20th century . Major critics such as M.A. Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the `` aesthetic and moral '' relevance of the novel , although there are also critics such as Germaine Greer , who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects ( such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way ) . In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism : Lawrence Lipking states ' even the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism , for instance , has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel ' The novel today is generally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature , as well as science fiction . </P> <P> Film director Guillermo del Toro describes Frankenstein as `` the quintessential teenage book '' , adding `` You do n't belong . You were brought to this world by people that do n't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering , and tears and hunger . It 's an amazing book written by a teenage girl . It 's mind blowing . '' Professor of philosophy Patricia MacCormack says the creature , brought to life by Victor Frankenstein , addresses the most fundamental human questions : `` It 's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is . Why are we here , what can we do ?

the human tendency to mimic other people’s behavior is an example of,Mirroring,"Mirroring ( psychology ) - wikipedia <H1> Mirroring ( psychology ) </H1> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .

Mirroring often occurs in social situations , particularly in the company of close friends or family . The concept often affects other individuals ' notions about the individual that is exhibiting mirroring behaviors , which can lead to the individual building rapport with others . </P> <P> Mirroring is the subconscious replication of another person 's nonverbal signals . This concept takes place in everyday interactions , and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored . The activation of mirror neurons takes place within the individual who begins to mirror another 's movements , and allows them a greater connection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring , as well as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with the other individual . Mirroring is distinct from conscious imitation under the premise that while the latter is a conscious , typically overt effort to copy another person , mirroring is subconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed . </P> <P> The display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy , as babies begin to mimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body movements . The ability to mimic another person 's actions allows the infant to establish a sense of empathy and thus begin to understand another person 's emotions . The infant continues to establish connections with other individual 's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements . </P> <P> Mirroring can establish rapport with the individual who is being mirrored , as the similarities in nonverbal gestures allow the individual to feel more connected with the person exhibiting the mirrored behavior . As the two individuals in the situation display similar nonverbal gestures , they may believe that they share similar attitudes and ideas as well . Mirror neurons react to and cause these movements , allowing the individuals to feel a greater sense of engagement and belonging within the situation . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Occurrence <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Interviews </Li> <Li> 1.2 Effects of lacking </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Development <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Self - concept </Li> <Li> 2.2 Empathy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Rapport <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Power dynamics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Occurrence ( edit ) </H2> Mirroring taking place during a meeting with President Reagan . <P> Mirroring generally takes place subconsciously as individuals react with the situation . Mirroring is common in conversation , as the listeners will typically smile or frown along with the speaker , as well as imitate body posture or attitude about the topic . Individuals may be more willing to empathize with and accept people whom they believe hold similar interests and beliefs , and thus mirroring the person with whom one is speaking may establish connections between the individuals involved . </P> <H3> Interviews ( edit ) </H3> <P> Additionally , mirroring may play a role in how well an individual fares in a job interview . Within a study conducted by Word , Zanna and Cooper , interviewers were instructed to follow specific types of body language in different experimental conditions . In one condition , interviewers were instructed to demonstrate distant and uninterested body language ( such as leaning away or avoiding eye contact ) , and in another condition they were asked to demonstrate more welcoming body language ( such as smiling and making eye contact ) . As a result , the individuals being interviewed began to mirror the actions of the interviewer , and thus the individuals in the condition with less friendly body language fared worse within the interview than did individuals in the friendly condition . The study demonstrates that the initial attitudes that an interviewer may have of the individual being interviewed may affect the performance of the interviewee due to mirroring . </P> <H3> Effects of lacking ( edit ) </H3> <P> Individuals with autism or other social difficulties may be less likely to exhibit mirroring , as they may be less subconsciously and consciously aware of the actions of others . This factor may cause additional difficulties for the individuals , as without mirroring , establishing connections with other people may be more difficult . Additionally , other individuals may be less likely to build rapport with the person , as without mirroring the person may seem more dissimilar and less friendly . Individuals who are not subconsciously aware of gesture may have difficulties in social situations , as they may be less able to understand another person 's perspective without it being explicitly stated , and thus may not understand covert cues that are often used in the social world . It is possible , though very rare , for some of these individuals to deliberately learn and become aware of these cues . This , however , is the exception to the rule , not the norm . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> A young boy mirrors the gesture of his grandmother . <P> In infant - parent interactions , mirroring consists of the parent imitating the infant 's expressions while vocalizing the emotion implied by the expression . This imitation helps the infant to associate the emotion with their expression , as well as feel validated in their own emotions as the parent shows approval through imitation . Studies have demonstrated that mirroring is an important part of child and infant development . According to Kohut 's theories of self - psychology , individuals need a sense of validation and belonging in order to establish their concepts of self . When parents mirror their infants , the action may help the child develop a greater sense of self - awareness and self - control , as they can see their emotions within their parent 's faces . Additionally , infants may learn and experience new emotions , facial expressions , and gestures by mirroring expressions that their parents utilize . The process of mirroring may help infants establish connections of expressions to emotions and thus promote social communication later in life . Infants also learn to feel secure and valid in their own emotions through mirroring , as the parent 's imitation of their emotions may help the child recognize their own thoughts and feelings more readily . </P> <H3> Self - concept ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Self - concept <P> Mirroring has been shown to play a critical role in the development of an infant 's notion of self . The importance of mirroring suggests that infants primarily gather their social skills from their parents , and thus a household that lacks mirroring may inhibit the child 's social development . Without mirroring , it may be difficult for the child to relate their emotions to socially learned expressions and thus have a difficult experience in expressing their own emotions . </P> <H3> Empathy ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Empathy <P> The inability to properly mirror other individuals may strain the child 's social relationships later in life . This strain may exist because others may feel more distant from the child due to a lack of rapport , or because the child may have a difficult time feeling empathy for others without mirroring . Mirroring helps to facilitate empathy , as individuals more readily experience other people 's emotions through mimicking posture and gestures . This empathy may help individuals create lasting relationships and thus excel in social situations . The action of mirroring allows individuals to believe they are more similar to another person , and perceived similarity can be the basis for creating a relationship . </P> <H2> Rapport ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Rapport <P> Rapport may be an important part of social life , as establishing rapport with an individual is generally the initial route to becoming friends or acquaintances with another person . Mirroring can help establish rapport , as exhibiting similar actions , attitudes , and speech patterns as another person may lead them to believe that one is more similar to them and thus more likely to be a friend . Individuals may believe that because one replicates the individual 's gestures , that one may hold similar beliefs and attitudes as the individual . Mirroring may be more pervasive in close friendships or romantic relationships , as the individuals regard each other highly and thus wish to emulate or appease them . Additionally , individuals who are friends may have more similarities than two strangers , and thus may be more likely to exhibit similar body language regardless of mirroring . </P> <H3> Power dynamics ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Power ( social and political ) <P> Additionally , individuals are likely to mirror the person of higher status or power within the situation . Mirroring individuals of higher power may create an illusion of higher status , or create rapport with the individual in power , thus allowing the person to gain favor with the individual in power . This mechanism may be helpful for individuals in situations where they are in a position of bargaining with an individual who possesses more power , as the rapport that mirroring creates may help to persuade the higher status individual to help the person of lower status . These situations include job interviews , other work situations such as requesting promotions , parent - child interactions , and asking professors for favors . Each of these situations involve one party who is in a more powerless position for bargaining , and another party who has the ability to fulfill the person of lower status 's needs , but may not necessarily wish to . Thus , mirroring can be a useful tool for individuals of lower status in order to persuade the other party to relinquish goods or privileges for the lower status party . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Eye contact </Li> <Li> Facial expression </Li> <Li> Gesture </Li> <Li> Kinesthetic learning </Li> <Li> Nonverbal communication </Li> <Li> Mirror stage </Li> <Li> Mirror neuron </Li> <Li> Posture </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Chartrand , T. ; Bargh , J. `` The Chameleon Effect : The Perception - Behavior Link and Social Interaction '' ( PDF ) . yale.edu .

The series is filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , with some scenes in season two filmed in Coquitlam , British Columbia , at Riverview Hospital . Production began on the pilot episode on December 2 , 2010 . The pilot is written by series creator and executive producer Veena Sud and is directed by Patty Jenkins . </P> <P> In contrast to the original Danish series , executive producer Veena Sud explained , `` We 're creating our own world . We are using the Danish series as a blueprint , but we are kind of diverging and creating our own world , our world of suspects and , potentially , ultimately who killed Rosie Larsen . '' Sud describes the series as `` slow - burn storytelling in a sense that every moment that we do n't have to prettify or gloss over or make something necessarily easy to digest , that we 're able to go to all sorts of places that are honest , and dark , and beautiful and tragic , in a way that is how a story should be told . '' </P> <H3> First cancellation and Revival ( edit ) </H3> <P> AMC announced on July 27 , 2012 that the series would not be renewed for a third season . However , Fox Television Studios announced that they were attempting to shop the show to other networks . In August 2012 , it was revealed that Fox Television Studios was in talks with both DirecTV and Netflix in an attempt to revive the series . In November 2012 , it was confirmed that Fox Television Studios was in final negotiations with Netflix to continue the series for a third season . AMC , which had originally canceled the show , was also included in the deal , which would gain the network the privilege of airing the new episodes before being hosted by Netflix , in return for sharing any associated production costs with Netflix . Variety reported on November 30 , 2012 , that the show would be returning to AMC , planning for a May 2013 debut , with production set to begin months before that . Cast members Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman were confirmed to return , with Veena Sud as showrunner and returning writers including executive producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin . On December 12 , 2012 , it was confirmed that cast members Billy Campbell , Michelle Forbes , and Brent Sexton would not return for the third season . </P> <P> On January 15 , 2013 , AMC and Fox Television Studios announced that the series had been renewed for a 12 - episode third season . Production started on February 25 , 2013 , in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , and ended on June 25 , 2013 . </P> <H3> Second cancellation and Revival ( edit ) </H3> <P> AMC ultimately canceled the series after the third season in September 2013 . However , in November 2013 , two months after its cancellation , Netflix announced it had picked up The Killing for a fourth and final season consisting of six episodes . Cast members Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman returned , with Veena Sud as showrunner , and executive producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin returning as writers . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reviewers and fans of three seasons of Veena Sud 's U.S. TV series , The Killing , have noted similarities and borrowed elements from David Lynch 's TV series Twin Peaks and the follow - up film Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me , and compared and contrasted Sud and Lynch 's works . </P> Season 1 ( edit ) <P> The series premiere was praised by most critics , Metacritic gave it a score of 84 / 100 based on reviews from 29 critics , indicating `` Universal acclaim '' . </P> <P> Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave the series a very positive review , calling it `` excellent , absorbing and addictive . When each episode ends , you long for the next -- a hallmark of great dramas . '' Goodman also praised Mireille Enos 's performance as the lead character Sarah , saying , `` It 's not until you watch Enos play Sarah for a while that it sinks in -- there has n't been a female American character like her probably ever . '' </P> <P> Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker gave it a B+ , saying , `` The acting is strikingly good '' and that `` ( s ) ome viewers may find The Killing a little too cold and deliberate , but give it time . Its intensity builds steadily , giving the series unexpected power . '' Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun said the series `` is soaked in atmosphere and steeped in the stark realism of Scandinavian crime novelists Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson '' and that it `` is not as much about a young girl 's murder as it is a psychological study of what happens afterward , how a tight - knit community tries to recover and how a dead child 's mother , father and siblings learn to deal with their pain in their own private ways . '' Matt Roush of TV Guide applauded the series , calling the acting `` tremendous '' and saying that he `` was instantly hooked by the moody atmosphere of this season - long murder mystery set in Seattle . '' He went on to say , `` What really stands out for me , in this age of cookie - cutter procedurals , is how The Killing dramatizes the devastation a violent death has on a family , a community , on the people involved in the investigation . Nothing about this show is routine . '' </P> <P> Subsequent episodes were met with lesser praise by some critics , criticizing the show 's reliance upon increasingly implausible red herrings to drive each episode and the withholding of details about each character 's background , especially Rosie 's , thus making them difficult to relate to or empathize with . </P> <P> The first - season finale was met with negative reviews from some critics . The Los Angeles Times called it `` one of the most frustrating finales in TV history , '' with Alan Sepinwall of HitFix.com calling the end `` insulting . '' Finally , Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said that the finale `` killed off any interest I had in ever watching the show again . '' `` ( The show ) began last spring looking like the smartest , most stylish pilot in years , '' complained Heather Havrilevsky in The New York Times Magazine . `` Fast - forward to the finale , in which we learn that what we 've been watching is actually a 26 - hour - long episode of Law & Order , and we 're only halfway through it . '' </P> Season 2 ( edit ) <P> The early seasonal episodes received generally favorable reviews from critics , with Metacritic giving it a score of 68 / 100 based on reviews from 23 critics . </P> <P> Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun - Times stated : `` Few television shows are as addictive as this pensive , wonderfully paced suspenser . '' The Washington Post 's Hank Stuever stated : `` My own enjoyment of The Killing begins and ends with the gloom so brilliantly conveyed by its pace and performances . '' Brian Lowry of Variety stated the series remained `` compelling , '' adding that `` the writers ... are adept at overcoming the stodgy pace by dangling tantalizing clues near each hour 's end , creating a strong pull to see what transpires next . '' HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall compared this season to the first and called it `` better . '' He added : `` The performances are still good , and now the characterization is a bit better . When you add that to the fine atmosphere ... and you view the mystery itself as a kind of necessary evil that allows you to see the parts of the show that do work , then it 's not bad . '' </P> <P> The season finale , `` What I Know , '' received mixed reviews . Sepinwall stated : `` I 'd like to say that season 2 of The Killing was an improvement on season 1 , and in some ways , it probably was . The second season certainly did a better job of doing what Veena Sud claimed to be doing last year , in that it took advantage of the extra time to sketch in some of the characters ... I honestly feel like any kinder feelings I have for the second season came from the complete lack of investment I had in it . '' Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the finale 4.7 out of 5 stars , but , upon first viewing , `` was n't sure what to feel . I was n't elated . I was n't excited '' but after watching it again was `` sucked into the world , mesmerized not by the victory of our hero cops ... but by the gut - wrenching moments that unfolded . '' CraveOnline 's William Bibbiani called the finale `` an odd duck . '' After citing Jamie 's early revelation as `` melodramatic silliness , '' Bibbiani added : `` The rest of the episode gets its job done , with one major , glaring flaw . The characters end up more or less where they need to be , but some nearly ridiculous loose ends remain . '' Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this finale a C - , calling it `` so unconvincing , '' adding `` I could n't believe how little all this resolution affected me after The Killing so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks ago . This is the same show that delivered Richmond 's hospital nightmare , the hunt for Holder , the anti-Western standoff `` Sayonara , Hiawatha , '' and the crazy train of the last two weeks ? No , this is the full - circle episode , the one that takes the show back to its roots . Wah wah . '' </P> <H3> Ratings ( edit ) </H3> <P> When it premiered , the pilot was AMC 's second - highest original series premiere , following The Walking Dead . The premiere drew 2.7 million viewers and a 2 household rating .

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th - century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . </P> <P> The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed : </P> <Ul> <Li> catholic in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of Jesus Christ in unbroken continuity with the early apostolic church . This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early Church Fathers , as formalised in the Apostles ' , Nicene , and Athanasian creeds . </Li> <Li> reformed in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th - century Protestant Reformation , in particular in the Thirty - Nine Articles of Religion and the Book of Common Prayer . </Li> </Ul> <P> In the earlier phase of the English Reformation there were both Catholic martyrs and radical Protestant martyrs . The later phases saw the Penal Laws punish Roman Catholic and nonconforming Protestants . In the 17th century , the Puritan and Presbyterian factions continued to challenge the leadership of the Church which under the Stuarts veered towards a more catholic interpretation of the Elizabethan Settlement especially under Archbishop Laud and the rise of the concept of Anglicanism as the Via Media . After the victory of the Parliamentarians the Prayer Book was abolished and the Presbyterian and Independent factions dominated . The Episcopacy was abolished . The Restoration restored the Church of England , episcopacy and the Prayer Book . Papal recognition of George III in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance . </P> <P> Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has used a liturgy in English . The church contains several doctrinal strands , the main three known as Anglo - Catholic , Evangelical and Broad Church . Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the ordination of women and homosexuality . The church includes both liberal and conservative clergy and members . </P> <P> The governing structure of the church is based on dioceses , each presided over by a bishop . Within each diocese are local parishes . The General Synod of the Church of England is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops , other clergy and laity . Its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early Christianity in England </Li> <Li> 1.2 Separation from Rome </Li> <Li> 1.3 Stuart period </Li> <Li> 1.4 19th century </Li> <Li> 1.5 Overseas developments </Li> <Li> 1.6 21st century <Ul> <Li> 1.6. 1 Deposition from holy orders overturned </Li> <Li> 1.6. 2 Dwindling congregations </Li> <Li> 1.6. 3 Low salaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Doctrine and practice <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Worship and liturgy </Li> <Li> 2.2 Women 's ministry </Li> <Li> 2.3 Same - sex unions and LGBT clergy </Li> <Li> 2.4 Liberal theology </Li> <Li> 2.5 Bioethics issues </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Poverty <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Church Urban Fund <Ul> <Li> 3.1. 1 Child poverty </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2 Action on hunger </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Membership </Li> <Li> 5 Structure <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Primates </Li> <Li> 5.2 Diocesan bishops </Li> <Li> 5.3 Representative bodies </Li> <Li> 5.4 House of Lords </Li> <Li> 5.5 Crown dependencies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Sex abuse </Li> <Li> 7 Financial situation </Li> <Li> 8 Online church directory </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Further reading </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the Church of England <H3> Early Christianity in England ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : History of Christianity in England and Anglo - Saxon Christianity <P> According to tradition , Christianity arrived in Britain in the 1st or 2nd century , during which time southern Britain became part of the Roman Empire . The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native Britons is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as Tertullian and Origen in the first years of the 3rd century . Three Romano - British bishops , including Restitutus , are known to have been present at the Council of Arles in 314 . Others attended the Council of Serdica in 347 and that of Ariminum in 360 , and a number of references to the church in Roman Britain are found in the writings of 4th century Christian fathers . Britain was the home of Pelagius , who opposed Augustine of Hippo 's doctrine of original sin . </P> <P> While Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the Anglo - Saxon invasion , Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their native paganism . Consequently , in 597 , Pope Gregory I sent the prior of the Abbey of St Andrew 's ( later canonised as Augustine of Canterbury ) from Rome to evangelise the Angles . This event is known as the Gregorian mission and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history . With the help of Christians already residing in Kent , Augustine established his church at Canterbury , the capital of the Kingdom of Kent , and became the first in the series of Archbishops of Canterbury in 598 . A later archbishop , the Greek Theodore of Tarsus , also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England . The Church of England has been in continuous existence since the days of St Augustine , with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its episcopal head . Despite the various disruptions of the Reformation and the English Civil War , the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by Augustine . </P> <P> While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the Synod of Whitby , the Christian in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times . Queen Bertha of Kent was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived , and Celtic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the Synod of Whitby . </P> Hereford is one of the church 's 43 cathedrals ; many have histories stretching back centuries <P> The Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in England . This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda 's double monastery of Streonshalh ( Streanæshalch ) , later called Whitby Abbey . It was presided over by King Oswiu , who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling . </P> <H3> Separation from Rome ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1534 , King Henry VIII separated the English Church from Rome . A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church , such as Lollardy , but the English Reformation gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne Boleyn . Pope Clement VII , considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a papal dispensation and how Catherine 's nephew , Emperor Charles V , might react to such a move , refused the annulment . Eventually , Henry , although theologically opposed to Protestantism , took the position of Supreme Head of the Church of England to ensure the annulment of his marriage . He was excommunicated by Pope Paul III . </P> <P> In 1536 -- 40 Henry VIII engaged in the Dissolution of the Monasteries , which controlled much of the richest land . He disbanded monasteries , priories , convents and friaries in England , Wales and Ireland , appropriated their income , disposed of their assets , and provided pensions for the former residents . The properties were sold to pay for the wars . Bernard argues : </P> <Dl> <Dd> The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history . There were nearly 900 religious houses in England , around 260 for monks , 300 for regular canons , 142 nunneries and 183 friaries ; some 12,000 people in total , 4,000 monks , 3,000 canons , 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns ... one adult man in fifty was in religious orders . </Dd> </Dl> <P> The population of England at the time is estimated to have been only 2.5 million : half male of whom 750,000 adult . This is one in 75 , not 1 in 50 . However the latter figure is creditable if secular clergy are included . </P> <P> Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and , during his reign , Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England . Indeed , this part of Henry 's reign saw trials for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics . </P> <P> Under his son , King Edward VI , more Protestant - influenced forms of worship were adopted . Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Cranmer , a more radical reformation proceeded . A new pattern of worship was set out in the Book of Common Prayer ( 1549 and 1552 ) . These were based on the older liturgy in particular the Prayer Book of 1549 , but both influenced by Protestant doctrines such as justification by faith alone , the rejection of the sacrifice of the Mass , and the Real Presence understood as physical presence ( Cranmer was Calvinist in that he believed Christ was truly and really present in the Eucharist but after a spiritual manner as in a sacrament ) . The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the Forty - two Articles ( later revised to thirty - nine ) . The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king . Queen Mary I , who succeeded him , returned England again to the authority of the papacy , thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England . During her co-reign with her husband , King Philip , many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith . These are known as the Marian martyrs and the persecution led to her nickname of `` Bloody Mary '' . </P> Stained glass window in Rochester Cathedral , Kent <P> Mary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half - sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church . The settlement under Queen Elizabeth I ( from 1558 ) , known as the Elizabethan Settlement , tried to stir a middle way between radical Protestantism and Roman Catholicism , the via media , ( a term that actually only became current in the 1620s ) , as the character of the Church of England , a church moderately Reformed in doctrine , as expressed in the Thirty - Nine Articles , but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the Church Fathers . The three-fold ministry in the Apostolic Succession was maintained ; the institutional continuity of the Church was preserved without break ( at her accession almost all clergy had been ordained in Catholic Orders using the Roman Pontifical ) , although the character of the organization was changed by the adoption of some reformed doctrines and the simplification of the outwards forms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work ; the retention of medieval Canon Law , a much shortened Calendar of Saints and liturgical music . It was also an established church ( constitutionally established by the state with the Head of State as its supreme governor ) . The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century . </P> <H3> Stuart period ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Stuart period <P> For the next century , through the reigns of James I , who ordered the translation of the Bible known as the King James Version ( Authorized to be used in parishes which does not mean it was the official version ) , and Charles I , culminating in the English Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell , there were significant swings back and forth between two factions : the Puritans ( and other radicals ) who sought more far - reaching Protestant reforms , and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices . The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare . By Continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high , since the Civil was mainly about politics , but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury , William Laud and tens of thousands of civilians who died from the unsettled conditions . Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660 , the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed , and Presbyterian ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate . The 39 Articles were replaced by the Westminster Confession , the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship . Despite this , about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism . </P> Major repairs were done to Canterbury Cathedral after the Restoration in 1660 <P> With the Restoration of Charles II , Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version . One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation , taken for granted by the Tudors , had to be abandoned . The religious landscape of England assumed its present form , with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground , and those Puritans and Protestants who dissented from the Anglican establishment , having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control of it . One result of the Restoration was the ousting of 2,000 parish ministers who had not been ordained by bishops in the Apostolic Succession or had been by presbyters ( ministers in presbyter 's orders ) . Continuing official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century . Roman Catholics , perhaps 5 % of the English population ( down from 20 % in 1600 ) were grudgingly tolerated , having had little or no official representation after the Pope 's excommunication of Queen Elizabeth in 1570 , though the Stuarts were sympathetic to them . In the 18th century they dwindled to 1 % of the population mostly among eccentric gentry and their tenants and extended families . </P> <H3> 19th century ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the Fifth Article of the Union with Ireland 1800 , the Church of England and Church of Ireland were united into `` one Protestant Episcopal church , to be called , the United Church of England and Ireland '' . Although this union was declared `` an essential and fundamental Part of the Union '' , the Irish Church Act 1869 separated the Irish part of the church again and disestablished it , the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871 . </P> <H3> Overseas developments ( edit ) </H3> Captain John Smith 's 1624 map of Bermuda , showing St Peter 's at centre , left Main article : Anglican Communion Further information : Historical development of Church of England dioceses § Colonial dioceses <P> As the British Empire expanded , British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England . As they developed or , beginning with the United States of America , became sovereign or independent states , many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the Anglican Communion . </P> <P> In Bermuda , the oldest remaining English colony ( now designated a British Overseas Territory ) , the first Church of England services were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck , one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the Sea Venture which initiated Bermuda 's permanent settlement . The nine parishes of the Church of England in Bermuda , each with its own church and glebe land , rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the Nineteenth Century . From 1825 to 1839 , Bermuda 's parishes were attached to the See of Nova Scotia . Bermuda was then grouped into the new Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from 1839 . In 1879 , the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed . At the same time , a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland , but both continued to be grouped under the Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda until 1919 , when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop . </P> <P> The Church of England in Bermuda was renamed in 1978 as the Anglican Church of Bermuda , which is an extra-provincial diocese , with both metropolitan and primatial authority coming directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury . Among its parish churches is St Peter 's Church in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of St George 's Town , which is both the oldest Anglican and the oldest non-Roman Catholic church in the New World . </P> <H3> 21st century ( edit ) </H3> Deposition from Holy orders overturned ( edit ) <P> Under the guidance of Rowan Williams and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives , the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003 . The clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice , because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible . Although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry , they remain ordained as priests . </P> Dwindling congregations ( edit ) One of the now `` redundant '' buildings , Holy Trinity Church , Wensley , in North Yorkshire ; much of the current structure was built in the 14th and 15th Centuries <P> The archbishops of Canterbury and York warned in January 2015 that the Church of England will no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership is somehow reversed as typical Sunday attendances had halved to 800,000 in the previous 40 years : </P> <P> The urgency of the challenge facing us is not in doubt . Attendance at Church of England services has declined at an average of one per cent per annum over recent decades and , in addition , the age profile of our membership has become significantly older than that of the population ... Renewing and reforming aspects of our institutional life is a necessary but far from sufficient response to the challenges facing the Church of England ... The age profile of our clergy has also been increasing . Around 40 per cent of parish clergy are due to retire over the next decade or so . </P> <P> However , Sarah Mullally , the fourth woman chosen to become a bishop in the Church of England , insisted in June 2015 that declining numbers at services should not necessarily be a cause of despair for churches because people will still `` encounter God '' without ever taking their place in a pew , saying that people might hear the Christian message through social media sites such as Facebook or in a café run as a community project . Additionally , the church 's own statistics reveal that 9.7 million people visit an Anglican church every year and 1 million students are educated at Anglican schools ( which number 4,700 ) . </P> <P> Approximately 30 Church of England parish churches are declared `` closed for regular public worship '' ( previously termed `` redundant '' ) each year . Between 1969 and 2010 , a full 1795 closures were achieved , equalling roughly 11 % of the stock , with just over a third being Listed buildings , either Grade I or II . Of these , closures , only 514 were made since 1990 . Some active use is made of about half of the closed churches . </P> Low salaries ( edit ) <P> In 2015 the Church of England admitted that it was embarrassed to be paying staff under the living wage . The Church of England had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount . The archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged it was not the only area where the church `` fell short of its standards '' . </P> <H2> Doctrine and practice ( edit ) </H2> See also : Anglicanism and Anglican doctrine Richard Hooker ( 1554 -- 1600 ) , one of the most influential figures in shaping Anglican theology and self - identity <P> The canon law of the Church of England identifies the Christian scriptures as the source of its doctrine . In addition , doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the Church Fathers and ecumenical councils ( as well as the ecumenical creeds ) in so far as these agree with scripture . This doctrine is expressed in the Thirty - Nine Articles of Religion , the Book of Common Prayer , and the Ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of deacons , priests , and the consecration of bishops . Unlike other traditions , the Church of England has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder . However , Richard Hooker 's appeal to scripture , church tradition , and reason as sources of authority continue to inform Anglican identity . </P> Canterbury Cathedral houses the cathedra or episcopal chair of the Archbishop of Canterbury and is the cathedral of the Diocese of Canterbury and the mother church of the Church of England as well as a focus for the Anglican Communion <P> The Church of England 's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the Elizabethan Settlement , which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism . The Church of England affirms the Protestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters . The Thirty - nine Articles are the church 's only official confessional statement . Though not a complete system of doctrine , the articles highlight areas of agreement with Lutheran and Reformed positions , while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and Anabaptism . </P> <P> While embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation , the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers , unless these are considered contrary to scripture . It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation . The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to episcopal polity , with ordained orders of bishops , priests and deacons . There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy . Some consider it essential , while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church . In sum these express the ' Via Media ' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity , as minimum and sufficient ; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines . It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic , Reformed and Lutheran teachings . The Bible , the Creeds , Apostolic Order , and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity . Indeed , not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation , Diarmid MacCulloch , The Later Reformation in England , 1990 , p. 55 . The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions . The proponents of further changes , nonetheless , tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order ( abolition of bishops ) , governance ( Canon Law ) and liturgy ( ' too Catholic ' ) . They did not succeed because the Monarchy , the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent . Moreover , `` despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church , it had retained a catholic character . '' The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest ... '' a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it ; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments , especially the eucharist , ceremonial , and anti-Calvinist doctrine '' ( ibid pp. 78 -- 86 ) . The existence of cathedrals `` without substantial alteration '' and `` where the `` old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism , '' p. 79 . This is `` One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation , '' ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue . The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past , ibid . p. 142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I . </P> <P> The Church of England has , as one of its distinguishing marks , a breadth and `` open - mindedness '' . This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist . The three `` parties '' ( see Churchmanship ) in the Church of England are sometimes called high church ( or Anglo - Catholic ) , low church ( or evangelical Anglican ) and broad church ( or liberal ) . The high church party places importance on the Church of England 's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church , adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood . As their name suggests , Anglo - Catholics maintain many traditional Catholic practices and liturgical forms . The low church party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology . Historically , broad church has been used to describe those of middle - of - the - road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal Protestantism . The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static : in 2013 , 40 % of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical churches ( compared with 26 % in 1989 ) , and 83 % of very large congregations were evangelical . Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others . </P> <H3> Worship and liturgy ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Church of England 's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the Book of Common Prayer . In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern liturgical book , Common Worship , dating from 2000 , which can be used as an alternative to the BCP . Like its predecessor , the 1980 Alternative Service Book , it differs from the Book of Common Prayer in providing a range of alternative services , mostly in modern language , although it does include some BCP - based forms as well , for example Order Two for Holy Communion . ( This is a revision of the BCP service , altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the Agnus Dei before communion . ) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship . </P> <P> The liturgies are organised according to the traditional liturgical year and the calendar of saints . The sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist are generally thought necessary to salvation . Infant baptism is practised . At a later age , individuals baptised as infants receive confirmation by a bishop , at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors . The Eucharist , consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ 's Words of Institution , is believed to be `` a memorial of Christ 's once - for - all redemptive acts in which Christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith '' . </P> <P> The use of hymns and music in the Church of England has changed dramatically over the centuries . Traditional Choral evensong is a staple of most cathedrals . The style of psalm chanting harks back to the Church of England 's pre-reformation roots . During the 18th century , clergy such as Charles Wesley introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns . </P> <P> In the latter half of the 20th century , the influence of the Charismatic Movement significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes , primarily affecting those of evangelical persuasion . These churches now adopt a contemporary worship form of service , with minimal liturgical or ritual elements , and incorporating contemporary worship music . </P> <H3> Women 's ministry ( edit ) </H3> <P> Women were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy . Women have been lay readers for a long time . During the First World War , some women were appointed as lay readers , known as `` bishop 's messengers '' , who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men . After that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969 . </P> <P> Legislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987 . The ordination of women as priests was passed by the General Synod in 1992 and began in 1994 . In 2010 , for the first time in the history of the Church of England , more women than men were ordained as priests ( 290 women and 273 men ) . </P> <P> In July 2005 , the synod voted to `` set in train '' the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops . In February 2006 , the synod voted overwhelmingly for the `` further exploration '' of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who is a woman . On 7 July 2008 , the synod voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept the ministry of bishops who are women . Actual ordinations of women to the episcopate required further legislation , which was narrowly rejected in a vote at General Synod in November 2012 . </P> <P> On 20 November 2013 , the General Synod voted overwhelmingly in support of a plan to allow the ordination of women as bishops , with 378 in favour , 8 against and 25 abstentions . </P> <P> On 14 July 2014 , the General Synod approved the ordination of women as bishops . The House of Bishops recorded 37 votes in favour , two against with one abstention . The House of Clergy had 162 in favour , 25 against and four abstentions . The House of Laity voted 152 for , 45 against with five abstentions . This legislation had to be approved by the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Parliament before it could be finally implemented at the November 2014 synod . </P> <P> In December 2014 , Libby Lane was announced as the first woman to become a bishop in the Church of England . She was consecrated as a bishop in January 2015 . </P> <P> In July 2015 , Rachel Treweek was the first woman to become a diocesan bishop in the Church of England when she became the Bishop of Gloucester . She and Sarah Mullally , Bishop of Crediton , were the first women to be ordained as bishops at Canterbury Cathedral . Treweek later made headlines by calling for gender - inclusive language , saying that `` God is not to be seen as male . God is God . '' </P> <P> In May 2018 , the Diocese of London consecrated Dame Sarah Mullally as the first woman to serve as the Bishop of London . Bishop Sarah Mullally occupies the third most senior position in the Anglican church . Mullally has described herself as a feminist and will ordain both men and women to the priesthood . She is also considered by some to be a theological liberal . On women 's reproductive rights , Mullally describes herself as pro-choice while also being personally pro-life . On marriage , she supports the current stance of the Church of England that marriage is between a man and a woman , but also said that `` It is a time for us to reflect on our tradition and scripture , and together say how we can offer a response that is about it being inclusive love . '' </P> <P> After the consecration of the first women as bishops , Women and the Church ( WATCH ) , a group supporting the ministries of women in the Church of England , called for language referring to God as `` Mother '' . This call for more gender inclusive language has receive the outspoken support of the Rt Rev Alan Wilson , the Bishop of Buckingham . In 2015 , the Rev Jody Stowell , from WATCH , expressed her support for female images saying `` we 're not restricted to understanding God with one gender . I would encourage people to explore those kinds of images . They 're wholly Biblical . '' </P> <H3> Same - sex unions and LGBT clergy ( edit ) </H3> See also : Same - sex marriage in the United Kingdom , LGBT rights in the United Kingdom , and Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion <P> The Church of England has been discussing same - sex marriages and LGBT clergy . `` The Church of England does not allow gay weddings , but its priests are allowed to be in a civil partnership . '' The church holds that marriage is a union of one man with one woman . However , the church teaches `` Same - sex relationships often embody genuine mutuality and fidelity . '' The church also officially supports civil partnerships ; `` We believe that Civil Partnerships still have a place , including for some Christian LGBTI couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship . '' The `` Church of England does not conduct Civil Partnership Ceremonies or Same Sex Marriages but individual churches can conduct a service of thanksgiving after a ceremony . '' The church says `` clergy in the Church of England are permitted to offer prayers of support on a pastoral basis for people in same - sex relationships ; '' As such , many Anglican churches , with clergy open to it , `` already bless same - sex couples on an unofficial basis . '' </P> <P> Civil Partnerships for clergy have been allowed since 2005 . The church extends pensions to clergy in civil unions . In a missive to clergy , the church communicated that `` there was a need for committed same - sex couples to be given recognition and ' compassionate attention ' from the Church , including special prayers . '' `` There is no prohibition on prayers ' being said in church or there being a ' service ' '' after a civil union . After same - sex marriage was legalised , the church asked for the government to continue to offer civil unions saying `` The Church of England recognises that same - sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality . Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework . '' </P> <P> In 2014 , the Bishops released guidelines that permit `` more informal kind of prayer '' for couples . In the guidelines , `` gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding , the bishops have agreed . '' In 2016 , The Bishop of Grantham , the Rt Rev Nicholas Chamberlain , announced he is gay , in a same - sex relationship and celibate ; becoming the first bishop to do so in the church . The church had decided in 2013 that gay clergy in civil partnerships could become bishops . `` The House ( of Bishops ) has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships , and living in accordance with the teaching of the church on human sexuality , can be considered as candidates for the episcopate . '' </P> <P> In 2017 , the House of Clergy voted against the motion to ' take note ' of the Bishops ' report defining marriage as between a man and a woman . Due to passage in all three houses being required , the motion was rejected . After General Synod rejected the motion , the Archbishops of Canterbury and York called for `` radical new Christian inclusion '' that is `` based on good , healthy , flourishing relationships , and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual . '' The church officially opposes ' conversion ' therapy , a practice which attempts to change a gay or lesbian person 's sexual orientation , calling it unethical and supports the banning of ' conversion ' therapy in the UK . The Diocese of Hereford approved a motion calling for the church `` to create a set of formal services and prayers to bless those who have had a same - sex marriage or civil partnership . '' </P> <P> Regarding transgender issues , the 2017 General Synod voted in favour of a motion saying that transgender people should be `` welcomed and affirmed in their parish church ... '' The motion also asked the Bishops `` to look into special services for transgender people . '' The House of Bishops declined to create a new liturgy , but advised that clergy adapt the service for an affirmation of baptism to mark a gender transition . `` The House notes that the Affirmation of Baptismal Faith , found in Common Worship , is an ideal liturgical rite which trans people can use to mark this moment of personal renewal . '' Transgender people may marry in the Church of England after legally making a transition . `` Since the Gender Recognition Act ( 2004 ) , trans people legally confirmed in their gender identity under its provisions are able to marry someone of the opposite sex in their parish church . '' Since 2000 , the church has allowed priests to undergo gender transition and remain in office . The church has ordained openly transgender clergy since 2005 . </P> <H3> Liberal theology ( edit ) </H3> See also : Liberal Christianity <P> Just as the Church of England has a large conservative or `` traditionalist '' wing , it also has many liberal members and clergy . Approximately one third of clergy `` doubt or disbelieve in the physical resurrection '' . Others , such as the Revd Giles Fraser , a contributor to The Guardian , have argued for an allegorical interpretation of the virgin birth of Jesus . The Independent reported in 2014 that , according to a YouGov survey of Church of England clergy , `` as many as 16 per cent are unclear about God and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct . '' Moreover , many congregations are seeker - friendly environments . For example , one report from the Church Mission Society suggested that the church open up `` a pagan church where Christianity ( is ) very much in the centre '' to reach out to spiritual people . </P> <H3> Bioethics issues ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Church of England is generally opposed to abortion but recognises that `` there can be - strictly limited - conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative '' . The church also opposes euthanasia . Its official stance is that `` While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying / suicide and voluntary euthanasia , the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying / suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice . '' It also states that `` Equally , the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering , but believes that assisted dying / suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals . '' However , George Carey , a former Archbishop of Canterbury , announced that he had changed his stance on euthanasia in 2014 and now advocated legalising `` assisted dying '' . On embryonic stem - cell research , the church has announced `` cautious acceptance to the proposal to produce cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for research '' . </P> <H2> Poverty ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Church Urban Fund ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Church Urban Fund <P> The Church of England set up the Church Urban Fund in the 1980s to tackle poverty and deprivation . They see poverty as trapping individuals and communities with some people in urgent need . This leads to dependency , homelessness , hunger , isolation , low income , mental health problems , social exclusion and violence . They feel that poverty reduces confidence and life expectancy and that people born in poor conditions have difficulty escaping their disadvantaged circumstances . </P> Child poverty ( edit ) <P> In parts of Liverpool , Manchester and Newcastle two - thirds of babies are born to poverty and have poorer life chances , also life expectancy 15 years lower than babies born in most fortunate communities . South Shore , Blackpool , has lowest life expectancy at 66 years for men . </P> <P> The deep - rooted unfairness in our society is highlighted by these stark statistics . Children being born in this country , just a few miles apart , could n't witness a more wildly differing start to life . In child poverty terms , we live in one of the most unequal countries in the western world . We want people to understand where their own community sits alongside neighbouring communities . The disparity is often shocking but it 's crucial that , through greater awareness , people from all backgrounds come together to think about what could be done to support those born into poverty . ( Paul Hackwood , the Chair of Trustees at Church Urban Fund ) </P> <H3> Action on hunger ( edit ) </H3> <P> Many prominent people in the Church of England have spoken out against poverty and welfare cuts in the United Kingdom . Twenty - seven bishops are among 43 Christian leaders who signed a letter which urged David Cameron to make sure people have enough to eat . </P> <P> We often hear talk of hard choices . Surely few can be harder than that faced by the tens of thousands of older people who must ' heat or eat ' each winter , harder than those faced by families whose wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30 % in just five years . Yet beyond even this we must , as a society , face up to the fact that over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system , whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions . </P> <P> Benefit cuts , failures and `` punitive sanctions '' force thousands of UK citizens to use food banks . The campaign to end hunger considers this `` truly shocking '' and called for a national day of fasting on 4 April 2014 . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> <P> Official figures from 2005 showed there were 25 million baptised Anglicans in England and Wales . Due to its status as the established church , in general , anyone may be married , have their children baptised or their funeral in their local parish church , regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers . </P> <P> Between 1890 and 2001 , churchgoing in the United Kingdom declined steadily . In the years 1968 to 1999 , Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved , from 3.5 per cent of the population to 1.9 per cent . By the year 2014 , Sunday church attendances had declined further to 1.4 per cent of the population . One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends were to continue , Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and just 87,800 in 2050 . </P> <P> In 2011 , the Church of England published statistics showing 1.7 million people attending at least one of its services each month , a level maintained since the turn of the millennium ; approximately one million participating each Sunday and three million taking part in a Church of England service on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve . The church also claimed that 30 % attend Sunday worship at least once a year ; more than 40 % attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there . Nationally the Church of England baptises one child in ten ( 2011 ) . In 2015 , the church 's statistics showed that 2.6 million people attended a special Advent service , 2.4 million attended a Christmas service , 1.3 million attended an Easter service , and 980,000 attended service during an average week . In 2016 , 2.6 million people attended a Christmas service , 1.2 million attended an Easter service , 1.1 million people attended a service in the Church of England each month , an average of 930,000 people attended a weekly service , an additional 180,000 attended a service for school each week , and an average of 740,000 people attended Sunday service . </P> <P> The Church of England has 18,000 active ordained clergy and 10,000 licensed lay ministers . In 2009 , 491 people were recommended for ordination training , maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium , and 564 new clergy ( 266 women and 298 men ) were ordained . More than half of those ordained ( 193 men and 116 women ) were appointed to full - time paid ministry . In 2011 , 504 new clergy were ordained , including 264 to paid ministry , and 349 lay readers were admitted to ministry ; and the mode age - range of those recommended for ordination training had remained 40 -- 49 since 1999 . </P> <H2> Structure ( edit ) </H2> See also : Anglican ministry and List of Church of England dioceses Dioceses of the Church of England Province of Canterbury Province of York <P> Article XIX ( ' Of the Church ' ) of the 39 Articles defines the church as follows : </P> <P> The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men , in which the pure Word of God is preached , and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ 's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same . </P> <P> The British monarch has the constitutional title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England . The canon law of the Church of England states , `` We acknowledge that the Queen 's most excellent Majesty , acting according to the laws of the realm , is the highest power under God in this kingdom , and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes , as well ecclesiastical as civil . '' In practice this power is often exercised through Parliament and the Prime Minister . </P> <P> The Church of Ireland and the Church in Wales separated from the Church of England in 1869 and 1920 respectively and are autonomous churches in the Anglican Communion ; Scotland 's national church , the Church of Scotland , is Presbyterian but the Scottish Episcopal Church is in the Anglican Communion . </P> <P> In addition to England , the jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands and a few parishes in Flintshire , Monmouthshire , Powys and Radnorshire in Wales which voted to remain with the Church of England rather than joining the Church in Wales . Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe . </P> <P> The church is structured as follows ( from the lowest level upwards ) : </P> The parish church of St Lawrence in Toot Baldon is typical of many small English village churches <Ul> <Li> Parish is the most local level , often consisting of one church building and community , although many parishes are joining forces in a variety of ways for financial reasons . The parish is looked after by a parish priest who for historical or legal reasons may be called by one of the following offices : vicar , rector , priest in charge , team rector , team vicar . The first , second , and fourth of these may also be known as the ' incumbent ' . The running of the parish is the joint responsibility of the incumbent and the Parochial Church Council ( PCC ) , which consists of the parish clergy and elected representatives from the congregation . The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is not formally divided into parishes . </Li> <Li> There are a number of local churches that do not have a parish . In urban areas there are a number of proprietary chapels ( mostly built in the 19th century to cope with urbanisation and growth in population ) . Also in more recent years there are increasingly church plants and fresh expressions of church , whereby new congregations are planted in locations such as schools or pubs to spread the Gospel of Christ in non-traditional ways . </Li> </Ul> Map showing the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe with the archdeaconries colour - coded <Ul> <Li> Deanery , e.g. , Lewisham or Runnymede . This is the area for which a Rural Dean ( or area dean ) is responsible . It consists of a number of parishes in a particular district . The rural dean is usually the incumbent of one of the constituent parishes . The parishes each elect lay ( non-ordained ) representatives to the deanery synod . Deanery synod members each have a vote in the election of representatives to the diocesan synod . </Li> <Li> Archdeaconry , e.g. , the seven in the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe . This is the area under the jurisdiction of an archdeacon . It consists of a number of deaneries . </Li> <Li> Diocese , e.g. , Diocese of Durham , Diocese of Guildford , Diocese of St Albans . This is the area under the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop , e.g. , the Bishops of Durham , Guildford and St Albans , and will have a cathedral . There may be one or more assisting bishops , usually called suffragan bishops , within the diocese who assist the diocesan bishop in his ministry , e.g. , in Guildford diocese , the Bishop of Dorking . In some very large dioceses a legal measure has been enacted to create `` episcopal areas '' , where the diocesan bishop runs one such area himself and appoints `` area bishops '' to run the other areas as mini-dioceses , legally delegating many of his powers to the area bishops . Dioceses with episcopal areas include London , Chelmsford , Oxford , Chichester , Southwark , and Lichfield . The bishops work with an elected body of lay and ordained representatives , known as the Diocesan Synod , to run the diocese . A diocese is subdivided into a number of archdeaconries . </Li> <Li> Province , i.e. , Canterbury or York . This is the area under the jurisdiction of an archbishop , i.e. the Archbishops of Canterbury and York . Decision - making within the province is the responsibility of the General Synod ( see also above ) . A province is subdivided into dioceses . </Li> <Li> Primacy , i.e. , Church of England . In addition to his specific authority in his own province , each archbishop is `` Primate of All England '' ( Canterbury ) or `` Primate of England '' ( York ) and has powers that extend over the whole country -- for example his licence to marry without the banns ( marriage licence ) . </Li> <Li> Royal Peculiar , a small number of churches more closely associated with the Crown , and a very few with the law and are outside the usual church hierarchy though conforming to the rite . These are outside episcopal jurisdiction . </Li> </Ul> <P> All rectors and vicars are appointed by patrons , who may be private individuals , corporate bodies such as cathedrals , colleges or trusts , or by the bishop or directly by the Crown . No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty , and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience `` in all things lawful and honest '' to the bishop . Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property -- church and parsonage . Curates ( assistant clergy ) are appointed by rectors and vicars , or if priests - in - charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron . Cathedral clergy ( normally a dean and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter ) are appointed either by the Crown , the bishop , or by the dean and chapter themselves . Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed , or simply with permission . </P> <H3> Primates ( edit ) </H3> Justin Welby , Archbishop of Canterbury <P> The most senior bishop of the Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury , who is the metropolitan of the southern province of England , the Province of Canterbury . He has the status of Primate of All England . He is the focus of unity for the worldwide Anglican Communion of independent national or regional churches . Justin Welby has been Archbishop of Canterbury since the confirmation of his election on 4 February 2013 . </P> <P> The second most senior bishop is the Archbishop of York , who is the metropolitan of the northern province of England , the Province of York . For historical reasons ( relating to the time of York 's control by the Danes ) he is referred to as the Primate of England . John Sentamu became Archbishop of York in 2005 . The Bishop of London , the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions . </P> <H3> Diocesan bishops ( edit ) </H3> <P> The process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex , due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy , and is handled by the Crown Nominations Committee which submits names to the Prime Minister ( acting on behalf of the Crown ) for consideration . </P> <H3> Representative bodies ( edit ) </H3> Main article : General Synod of the Church of England <P> The Church of England has a legislative body , the General Synod . Synod can create two types of legislation , measures and canons . Measures have to be approved but can not be amended by the British Parliament before receiving the Royal Assent and becoming part of the law of England . Although it is the established church in England only , its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members . Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent , but form the law of the church , rather than the law of the land . </P> <P> Another assembly is the Convocation of the English Clergy , which is older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly . By the 1969 Synodical Government Measure almost all of the Convocations ' functions were transferred to the General Synod . Additionally , there are Diocesan Synods and deanery synods , which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the Church . </P> <H3> House of Lords ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Lords Spiritual <P> Of the 42 diocesan archbishops and bishops in the Church of England , 26 are permitted to sit in the House of Lords . The Archbishops of Canterbury and York automatically have seats , as do the Bishops of London , Durham and Winchester . The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by consecration . It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords , at which point he becomes a Lord Spiritual . The Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom . </P> <H3> Crown dependencies ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although they are not part of England or the United Kingdom , the Church of England is also the Established Church in the Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man , the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey . The Isle of Man has its own diocese of Sodor and Man , and the Bishop of Sodor and Man is an ex officio member of the Legislative Council of the Tynwald on the island . The Channel Islands are part of the Diocese of Winchester , and in Jersey the Dean of Jersey is a non-voting member of the States of Jersey . In Guernsey the Church of England is the Established Church , although the Dean of Guernsey is not a member of the States of Guernsey . </P> <H2> Sex abuse ( edit ) </H2> See also : Anglican Communion sexual abuse cases <P> The Archbishop of Canterbury , Justin Welby , has made some effort to prevent complaints of sex abuse cases being covered up . Independent investigators are examining files as far back as the 1950s and Welby hopes this independence will prevent any possibility of a cover - up . </P> <P> We will systematically bring those transparently and openly first of all working with the survivors where they are still alive and then seeing what they want . The rule is survivors come first , not our own interests , and however important the person was , however distinguished , however well - known , survivors come first . ( Justin Welby ) </P> <P> The personal files of all Anglican clergy since the 1950s are being audited in an effort to ensure no cover - up . Welby emphasised repeatedly that no cover - up would be acceptable . </P> <P> Despite such assurances there is concern that not enough may be done and historic abuse may still sometimes be covered up . Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society stated : </P> <P> The problem was n't that bishops were n't trained in such matters , it is the institutional culture of denial and the bullying of the abused and whistleblowers into silence . One report suggests that 13 bishops ignored letters written in the 1990s warning of abuse by Ball on behalf of a victim who later committed suicide . I have seen evidence that such bullying persists to this day . I hope that the Archbishop 's review into the case of Peter Ball will deal with such bullying and what appears to be the undue influence exerted on the police and CPS by the Church in dealing with this case . The total failure of procedures , outlined by Ian Elliott , echoes that revealed in the totally damning Cahill Report about the conduct of the Archbishop Hope of York in respect of Robert Waddington . The current Archbishop of York has decided that this report should remain in printed form rather than be more widely available on the web . </P> <P> Bishop Peter Ball was convicted in October 2015 on several charges of indecent assault against young adult men . There are allegations of large - scale earlier cover - ups involving many British establishment figures which prevented Ball 's earlier prosecution . There have also been allegations of child sex abuse , for example Robert Waddington . A complainant , known only as `` Joe '' , tried for decades to have action taken over sadistic sex abuse which Garth Moore perpetrated against him in 1976 when `` Joe '' was 15 years old . None of the high ranking clergy who `` Joe '' spoke to recall being told about the abuse , which `` Joe '' considers incredible . A representative of the solicitors firm representing `` Joe '' said : </P> <P> The Church of England wants to bury and discourage allegations of non-recent abuse . They know how difficult it is for survivors to come forward , and it appears from this case that the Church has a plan of making it hard for these vulnerable people to come forward . This survivor has had the courage to press his case . Most do not . Most harbour the psychological fallout in silence . We need to find a way to make the system more approachable for survivors . </P> <H2> Financial situation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Properties and finances of the Church of England <P> Although an established church , the Church of England does not receive any direct government support . Donations comprise its largest source of income , and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments . In 2005 , the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around £ 900 million . </P> <P> The Church of England manages an investment portfolio which is worth more than £ 8 billion . </P> <H2> Online Church directory ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Church of England supports A Church Near You , an online directory of churches . A user - edited resource , it currently lists 16,400 churches and has 7,000 editors in 42 dioceses . The directory enables parishes to maintain accurate location , contact and event information which is shared with other websites and mobile apps . In 2012 , the directory formed the data backbone of Christmas Near You and in 2014 was used to promote the church 's Harvest Near You initiative . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Anglicanism portal </Li> <Li> England portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of the largest Protestant bodies </Li> <Li> Appointment of Church of England bishops </Li> <Li> Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England </Li> <Li> Church of England Newspaper </Li> <Li> Church of England parish church </Li> <Li> Mothers ' Union </Li> <Li> Historical development of Church of England dioceses </Li> <Li> List of bishops in the Church of England </Li> <Li> List of archdeacons in the Church of England </Li> <Li> Ritualism in the Church of England </Li> <Li> List of the first 32 women ordained as Church of England priests </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Church of England '' . oikoumene.org .
