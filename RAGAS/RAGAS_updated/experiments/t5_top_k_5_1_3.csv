Understanding which payments are exempt from garnishment is crucial for:

1. Employee Financial Protection: Helps federal workers understand which income sources cannot be seized by creditors
2. HR Compliance: Ensures payroll and HR departments correctly handle wage garnishment requests
3. Legal Clarity: Provides precise guidance on federal wage protection regulations
4. Financial Planning: Assists employees in understanding their income security

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of Title 5 regulations, focusing on a specific section that has direct, tangible implications for federal employees' financial rights. It requires technical knowledge of federal employment law and shows a nuanced approach to understanding garnishment protections. The specificity of referencing the exact regulatory section (§581.104) further enhances its credibility and usefulness.","Based on the provided context, I cannot specifically answer what types of payments are not subject to garnishment according to §581.104, as this specific section (§581.104) is not included in the documents provided.
