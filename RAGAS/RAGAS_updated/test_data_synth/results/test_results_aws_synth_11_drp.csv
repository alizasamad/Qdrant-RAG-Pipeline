Final Separation Agreement 
This agreement is between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA” 
or “Agency”) and the Employee identified below. 
On June 9, 2025, NASA circulated an email communication to employees offering them a 
voluntary deferred resignation option.  The offer stated that those employees who accept the offer 
will not be subject to any reduction in pay and benefits by NASA and exempted th em f rom 
all applicable in-person work requirements until      or earlier if they choose 
to accelerate the resignation date for any reason. (“Deferred Resignation Program”).   
NASA has received Employee’s voluntary request to be included in the 
Deferred Resignation Program and the Agency accepts Employee’s request to be included in 
the Deferred Resignation Program. Accordingly, the p arties agree as follows:

While the date of the DRP offering could be historically interesting, it does not provide actionable information for current DRP management or separation processes. The question lacks practical value for day-to-day HR operations, does not address specific policy details, and does not help improve administrative efficiency. An HR professional would need more specific context about the program's implementation, current eligibility, or procedural requirements to effectively manage DRP cases. The question is too broad and lacks depth in addressing real HR administrative needs."

The question directly addresses a critical administrative and employee welfare concern that requires precise understanding of benefits continuation during the separation process.

The question meets all key evaluation criteria:

1. Relevance: Directly related to DRP policy and employee benefits during the transition period.

2. Practicality: Addresses a concrete administrative issue that HR professionals must clearly communicate and manage for departing employees.

3. Clarity: The question is straightforward and unambiguous, seeking specific information about benefit retention.

4. Depth: Requires comprehensive knowledge of NASA HR policies, benefits administration, and DRP regulations.

5. Applicability: Answering this question helps HR professionals ensure accurate benefits communication, maintain employee compliance, and prevent potential misunderstandings during the separation process.

Understanding which benefits an employee retains during the Deferred Resignation Period is crucial for both the organization and the employee, making this a high-value inquiry for HR management."

It directly addresses a critical policy issue that impacts employee rights, benefits, and separation procedures. 

The question demonstrates depth by probing into the intersection of DRP participation and broader federal funding scenarios. Understanding employee rights during an appropriations lapse is crucial for ensuring proper communication, maintaining compliance, and providing accurate guidance to affected personnel.

The query requires specialized knowledge of NASA HR policies, federal employment regulations, and the specific protections afforded to DRP participants during funding uncertainties. This makes it a substantive and nuanced question that goes beyond surface-level administrative concerns.

While extremely useful, it does not receive a perfect 5 rating because the practical frequency of appropriations lapses might limit its everyday applicability. However, for HR professionals who must be prepared for exceptional circumstances, this question represents an important area of procedural understanding.

The question would help HR specialists and supervisors:
- Understand employee entitlements during funding disruptions
- Communicate accurate information about rights and protections
- Ensure proper administrative handling of DRP cases during exceptional circumstances"

It would help HR professionals assess an employee's retirement options, verify eligibility requirements, and guide employees through potential early retirement scenarios. While slightly broad, it provides a meaningful starting point for discussing an employee's separation options.
