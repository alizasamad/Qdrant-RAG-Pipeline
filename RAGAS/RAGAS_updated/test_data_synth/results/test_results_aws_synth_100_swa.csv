is relevant. It is important to complete 
steps 1 and 2 first, because you need 
to understand how individual jobs fit 
into the overall work system. Human 
capital analytics is only helpful where 
the issue is related to the productivity or 
performance of different people in the 
same role.
Step 1 – competitive advantage analytics 
– is the most important, and in some 
ways is the most straightforward from 
the point of view of data analysis. You 
can find out most of what you need to 
know from qualitative interviews with 
key stakeholders, rather than having to 
build highly sophisticated mathematical 
models. However, this is also the stage 
that is most often skipped. But if you 
jump straight into either enterprise or 
human capital analysis, you can easily 
miss the critical link between business 
and people issues. You need step 1 to 
be able to distinguish between insights 
that offer only marginal improvements 
in operations and those that truly 
advance strategy (Levenson, 2015).
Key questions for human capital 
analytics 
• Is the job designed appropriately 
to justify the performance 
expectations you have of it?
• Is the role paid well enough?
• Could you improve productivity by 
enriching or enlarging the role?
• How interdependent is this role

It directly addresses a fundamental challenge in human capital analytics by focusing on the critical inquiry process that drives meaningful insights. The question is highly relevant because:

1. It seeks to establish the foundational approach to human capital analytics by identifying key investigative questions
2. It has broad applicability across different organizational contexts and levels of analytics maturity
3. It helps analytics professionals and HR leaders structure their analytical thinking and approach
4. The question implies a strategic perspective by using the term ""key questions"" - suggesting a focus on high-impact, transformative insights
5. It can help organizations move from reactive reporting to proactive, strategic workforce intelligence

The question would be particularly useful for:
- HR analytics teams developing their analytical frameworks
- Business leaders seeking to understand how to extract strategic value from workforce data
- Workforce planning professionals looking to align analytics with organizational goals
- Professionals transitioning into people analytics roles who need guidance on effective questioning strategies

By focusing on the ""key questions"", the inquiry goes beyond technical methodology and emphasizes the strategic thinking required to derive meaningful workforce insights."

BUILDING A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYTICS WITH STRATEGIC IMPACT AT ITS HEART
Having determined the critical strategic 
questions to address, it’s important 
to tackle each stage in the analytics 
process in the correct order. It may be 
tempting to dive straight into gathering 
and analysing data, but if you don’t have 
a clear set of hypotheses to test, or 
haven’t correctly lined up key business 
stakeholders so they are receptive to 
implementing the recommendations 
arising from the analysis, you are unlikely 
to reap a return on your investment.
Guenole et al. argue that many 
organisations fail to gain benefits 
from workforce analytics projects 
because they don’t approach them 
in a way that allows them to improve 
measurable business outcomes. And 
this is often because they start in the 
wrong place. The authors suggest that 
a way of avoiding this trap is to have a 
methodology for structuring analytics 
work. They propose an Eight Step Model 
for Purposeful Analytics (see Figure 
5). Their approach begins by deciding 
why to undertake the work – so, again, 
beginning with the end in mind.
The results of the CRF survey confirm 
that having a standard approach or 
methodology for analytics is a key gap 
for most organisations. Two-thirds (66%) 
of respondents report that they don’t 
have a methodology or standardised 
approach for HR analytics projects (see 
Figure 6).
Step 1: Frame business questions
This stage involves clarifying the",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly states that ""Two-thirds (66%) of respondents report that they don't have a methodology or standardised approach for HR analytics projects"", which precisely answers the question about the percentage of organizations lacking a methodology for HR analytics projects.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics as it seeks to quantify a critical gap in organizational capabilities around HR analytics implementation. The percentage of organizations lacking a structured methodology reveals important insights about the maturity and readiness of companies to leverage data-driven HR practices. 

For workforce analytics professionals and HR leaders, understanding the prevalence of methodological gaps can:
1. Benchmark organizational capabilities
2. Highlight the need for developing systematic approaches to analytics
3. Provide context for investment in analytics infrastructure and skills
4. Demonstrate the potential market opportunity for analytics solutions

The question is practical because it addresses a fundamental challenge many organizations face - moving from ad-hoc to structured analytics approaches. While seemingly simple, this statistic could be valuable for:
- HR strategy planning
- Technology vendors targeting analytics transformation
- Consulting firms designing capability development programs
- Academic researchers studying HR technology adoption

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it provides a snapshot statistic without deeper contextual insights. However, it remains a highly useful question for understanding the current state of workforce analytics methodological maturity."

Julian Holmes, Director, OrgVue
Guenole et al. suggest testing the 
importance of insights by asking 
the following questions.
• What does the insight tell me? 
Does it matter?
• Does this insight relate to the 
business question?
• Is this insight unique or just 
another twist on a familiar topic?
• Is the insight clear?
• What actions might result from 
this insight?

Data gathering – ethical and 
legal considerations
Workforce data is often highly sensitive, and 
organisations need to exercise great care in deciding 
what data to collect and what to do with it. For 
example, it is possible to monitor the content of 
people’s emails, but most organisations would shy 
away from what they would consider to be a highly 
intrusive practice. Increasing amounts of data are 
available from sensitive sources such as wearable 
technology and mobile phone records, placing an 
even greater responsibility on employers to exercise 
discretion.
Legal standards differ country to country, and 
organisations with employees in different regions 
will need to take account of this when determining 
data policies. In the US, data generated by employees 
at work is judged to be the company’s property, but 
in Europe, the balance of control is more in favour 
of the employee. That balance will shift further 
towards employees when the General Data Protection",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context provides substantial information about legal differences in employee data between the US and Europe, specifically noting that in the US, employee-generated work data is considered company property, while in Europe, the control balance favors employees more, with an indication of further shifts towards employee data protection.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics, addressing a critical compliance and data governance challenge. Understanding legal variations in employee data protection between regions is crucial for multinational organizations implementing workforce analytics. The question touches on important aspects of data privacy, legal compliance, and cross-border analytics strategy. It would be particularly valuable for:

1. HR professionals managing global workforce data
2. People analytics specialists designing data collection and analysis frameworks
3. Legal and compliance teams ensuring regulatory adherence
4. Business leaders planning international workforce strategies

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the complex legal landscape surrounding workforce data, which is essential for responsible and effective analytics implementation. While slightly technical, it represents a genuine and practical information need that directly impacts how organizations can collect, analyze, and leverage employee data across different regulatory environments.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it is somewhat narrow in scope, focusing specifically on legal standards rather than broader strategic implications. However, it remains a highly valuable question for professionals working in strategic workforce analytics."

indicate they use analytics to identify 
opportunities to make decisions that 
result in improved business outcomes, 
and to demonstrate the relationship 
between HR programmes and business 
outcomes. Larger organisations also have 
invested more in upskilling HR generalists 
and HR business partners in data and 
analytics, and are more likely to have an 
internal workforce analytics team.
Data quality
In Chapter 2 we discuss how to gather 
data and review some of the issues 
organisations are wrestling with when 
constructing the data sets they need to 
create effective analytics. Our survey 
suggests that data quality is a substantial 
barrier for many organisations. Only 
36% of respondents said business 
leaders frequently or always trust HR 
data as being consistently accurate and 
reliable (see Figure 12), and the quality 
of HR data, and access to and quality of 
business data, were the second, third and 
fifth most commonly reported barriers 
(see Figure 13 on page 32).
The CRF survey asked respondents to 
report the extent to which a number of 
factors commonly reported as barriers to 
successful implementation of analytics 
play out in their organisation. Figure 13 
on the following page sets out the full 
results. The principal barriers are grouped 
around two themes: the availability and 
depth of analytical capabilities, and the 
quality and availability of data.

The percentage of business leaders who trust HR data speaks directly to the effectiveness of workforce analytics implementation and the perceived reliability of HR metrics. 

Relevance: High, as it touches on a fundamental challenge in workforce analytics - establishing data trust and credibility.

Practicality: Very practical, as data trust is a key barrier to effective analytics adoption. Understanding the current level of trust can help HR and analytics professionals develop strategies to improve data quality, transparency, and communication.

Information Need: The question represents a genuine need to understand the current state of data perception within organizations, which is crucial for improving analytics capabilities.

Applicability: Extremely applicable for HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders looking to enhance the strategic value of workforce data. Knowing the trust level can inform targeted improvements in data collection, reporting, and communication strategies.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it provides a snapshot metric without immediately suggesting how to improve trust. However, it's still a highly valuable question for understanding the current state of workforce analytics credibility."
27,How do advanced analytics teams help with project prioritization?,Analytics' role in prioritizing proj initiatives?,"Advanced analytics teams help with project prioritization by providing advice on identifying business problems, assessing potential impact, requiring costed business cases, and offering strategic insights that can guide future project selection, while also maintaining the ability to turn down low-value projects or provide additional actionable recommendations when requests come from influential stakeholders.","More advanced analytics teams within your business are likely to be able to provide advice and direction on the best way to prioritise.

They are very experienced at identifying where the business problems are and where analytics can have greatest impact.""","team won’t support projects with a 
potential ROI of less than $100m. 
Similarly, UPS’s analytics team requires 
a costed business case.
• Prioritisation tends to be more 
straightforward when the head of 
analytics reports to, and has a close 
relationship with, a business-oriented 
CHRO, who can also back the team 
up when it has to turn down a request 
for help from someone influential.
• More advanced analytics teams 
within your business are likely to be 
able to provide advice and direction 
on the best way to prioritise. Brydie 
Lear said: “I rely on my advanced 
analytics colleagues in the bank to 
help with prioritisation. They are very 
experienced at identifying where the 
business problems are and where 
analytics can have greatest impact.”
• Although prioritisation means having 
to say no at times, sometimes people 
are sufficiently senior or influential 
that it is impossible to turn down their 
requests. In these situations, Alexis 
Fink recommends providing a ‘gift with 
purchase’ – in other words, as well as 
answering the specific question you’re 
given, provide further insights that are 
actionable and will have an impact. 
“That way, you are able to essentially 
‘train’ senior leaders regarding the 
high level strategic services you can 
provide, and help influence the nature 
of future requests,” she said.

1. Focusing on the strategic role of advanced analytics teams
2. Exploring how analytics can inform and improve decision-making processes
3. Highlighting the practical application of workforce analytics beyond traditional HR functions

The query would be valuable to multiple stakeholders:
- HR professionals seeking to demonstrate the strategic value of their analytics capabilities
- Business leaders interested in more data-driven project selection
- Analytics specialists looking to expand their impact within the organization
- Workforce planners aiming to optimize resource allocation

BUILDING THE ORGANISATION CAPABILITY FOR ANALYTICS
“In our view, reporting directly to the CHRO (or at least having direct access to the CHRO) yields 
the best outcomes for the analytics team and the organisation. This C-level reporting structure 
keeps the focus of the team closely aligned with strategic business priorities and has the 
greatest chance of informing decision making about important business topics.”
Guenole et al., 2017
Organisations need to consider a 
number of questions when deciding on 
the structure and reporting lines of the 
workforce analytics team.
1. Should there be a dedicated team 
within HR or should workforce 
analytics be part of a wider business 
analytics function?
Most of the organisations we encountered 
in this research that have workforce 
analytics capability tend to site it within the 
HR function. Just over two-thirds (69%) 
of respondents to the CRF survey have a 
dedicated team within HR (see Figure 19).
There are advantages and disadvantages 
to having a specialist team within HR.
Pros
• It creates air cover/space to incubate 
what is for most organisations an 
emerging capability. If workforce 
analytics is part of a broader function, 
there is a risk that resources that should 
be focused on workforce analytics will 
be diverted to other projects.
• There is a highly technical body of 
academic knowledge, predominantly 
in the occupational psychology 
domain, that needs to be applied. Lack 
of domain knowledge could lead to",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly states that 69% of survey respondents have a dedicated workforce analytics team within the HR function, providing a clear and precise answer to the question about where most organizations locate their workforce analytics team.",4,"This question is quite useful for workforce analytics professionals and organizational leaders. It addresses a practical and strategic consideration about the structural placement of workforce analytics teams, which can significantly impact their effectiveness and influence. The question seeks insights into organizational design and the optimal positioning of analytics functions within a company's structure. 

The relevance is high because team location can affect:
- Reporting lines and strategic alignment
- Access to key decision-makers
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Perceived importance of workforce analytics
- Ability to drive data-driven HR and business strategies

While seemingly simple, this question reveals important organizational dynamics around how companies view and implement workforce analytics. It would be valuable for HR leaders, organizational design specialists, and executives looking to optimize their analytics capabilities. The information could help organizations benchmark their current structure and consider potential improvements in how they organize and leverage workforce analytics teams."

the characteristics of the top 100 
performing stores, by looking at data,

academic input about what drives 
followership. The analysis found:
• there was an optimum team size in 
the store
• the length of tenure of the store 
manager was statistically significant – 
moving a store manager too soon led 
to lower performance. 
These insights allowed the retail team to 
develop a blueprint for high performing 
stores, and enabled HR to create a store 
management development programme 
to teach managers how to lead for 
high engagement. Deery’s team also 
developed an engagement toolkit – a 
mix of learning modules and tools 
allowing managers to self-diagnose 
based on the employee survey results 
for their store – that managers can use 
to improve performance. 
According to Deery, the results are 
evident: “The UK retail business has

rates and demographic data.
Of course, the success of workforce analytics is not just reliant on breaking down data silos. Insights are only valuable if they lead to action, and this requires 
collaboration between HR and business leaders to deliver tangible change. But what is striking in reading the results from the report is that organisations 
are still in the very early stages of deploying workforce analytics to improve performance; only 14% of businesses have used analytics to successfully predict 
outcomes and take action to a great extent. In my experience, leadership is the ultimate bridge between workforce analytics and actual execution. Without 
the ownership and sponsorship of the entire executive team, insights remain worthless. 
So how can businesses start to close the gap between the rhetoric and the reality of workforce analytics? At Concentra, we believe that organisations should 
begin by identifying what analysis is likely to add the greatest value to business outcomes. To do this, we help our clients use scenario modelling and other 
techniques to help companies better understand the relationship between their strategy, work and workforce. The result is unparalleled visibility across the

on reporting, metrics and creating 
dashboards, with analytics experts 
embedded in each of its core people 
processes such as recruitment and 
talent management. According to Ian 
Bailie, having this capability sitting close 
to the action is invaluable: “They sit 
next to the people they support and 
understand much better the business 
context and the problems their internal 
clients are looking to solve. And their 
conclusions are more implementable.”

AstraZeneca
The pharmaceuticals firm recently 
relocated its headquarters from 
the north-west of England to 
Cambridgeshire, which affected 2,000 
jobs. Workforce modelling was one of 
the key tasks of the project team that 
was set up to manage the relocation. 
Iain McKendrick, AstraZeneca’s VP 
HR Strategy, Planning & Analytics, 
seconded one of his analytics team 
members to the project. The analysis 
included modelling different hypotheses 
around what retention targets to set, 
what relocation incentives to offer, 
implications for the company’s diversity 
profile, and what financial provision to 
make for restructuring.
McKendrick said that predicting attrition 
doesn’t necessarily mean that you 
should try to stop everyone leaving. 
“You may instead use a predictive 
attrition model as part of a more 
integrated workforce planning system. 
It can be useful in gearing up your 
hiring plan for those areas where you 
are expecting to see high attrition, so 
you already have a full pipeline with 
candidates you are keeping warm, ready 
to fill any vacancies that arise.”

We see in Chapter 1 that interest in 
workforce analytics is partly driven by 
senior leaders’ increased expectations 
of the HR function. In some of the more 
advanced organisations, the board 
and senior leadership is a key source 
of demand for workforce analytics. 
Engaging this stakeholder group helps:
• keep the analytics team focused on 
business matters
• set the tone and expectations for 
data and evidence in people- and 
organisation-related matters.
One of the key relationships that 
workforce analytics should seek to 
cultivate is with the head of strategy or 
equivalent. Alexis Fink, General Manager, 
Talent Intelligence & Analytics at Intel, 
said: “It’s really important to nurture your 
relationship with the strategy offi   ce,

Understanding key stakeholders is fundamental to successfully implementing and leveraging workforce analytics projects. The question addresses a critical aspect of analytics strategy by identifying who needs to be involved, engaged, and consulted throughout the analytics process. 

The question is practical because it helps organizations:
1. Ensure comprehensive engagement across different organizational levels
2. Align analytics efforts with strategic business objectives
3. Identify potential champions and supporters of workforce analytics initiatives
4. Design communication and collaboration strategies

Key stakeholders typically include:
- HR leadership
- Business unit leaders
- C-suite executives
- Finance departments
- People analytics specialists
- IT and data management teams
- Operational managers

By clarifying stakeholder roles and expectations, organizations can create more effective, collaborative, and impactful workforce analytics programs.

Experian
Two years ago, staff turnover was an 
issue that was attracting the attention 
of the executive team at Experian, the 
credit reporting company. “Attrition was 
3-4% higher than the executive team 
wanted it to be, and there had been 
regular discussions about what actions 
we should take. We knew reducing 
turnover could add significant value to 
the bottom line,” said Olly Britnell, Head 
of Global Workforce Analytics. 
Britnell’s team built a model that 
predicts turnover by analysing around 
200 attributes that might drive ‘flight 
risk’, such as team size and structure, 
supervisor performance and distance/
length of commute. Given Experian’s 
core business capability in analytics, 
Britnell’s team was able to work with the 
internal experts who were responsible 
for the company’s credit scoring model, 
and they built the resulting employee 
turnover model using the same 
methodology. The model provides a 
risk score for every employee in the 
organisation, based on data from a wide 
range of sources – including the HR 
system and consumer profiling data. 
Managers can also use the model to test 
options for reducing the turnover risk for 
key individuals or groups, and to build 
retention plans accordingly – and they

By asking about a specific company's approach to predicting and reducing turnover, the question seeks practical insights into:

1. Predictive analytics techniques in workforce management
2. Real-world application of data-driven retention strategies
3. Methodological approaches to understanding and mitigating employee churn

The question is particularly valuable because:
- It references a specific case study (Experian), which suggests seeking concrete, implementable insights
- Addresses a key strategic HR challenge of talent retention
- Implies interest in both the analytical methodology and practical outcomes

While the question is somewhat narrow in focusing on one company, it represents a genuine information need for HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders looking to understand advanced workforce analytics applications. The specificity of the question about a known company like Experian adds credibility and suggests a desire for actionable, proven strategies.

The practical applicability is high, as understanding how a successful company predicts and reduces turnover can provide valuable benchmarking and strategic insights for other organizations seeking to improve their workforce retention efforts."

Some organisations have invested in  
e-learning, tools and case studies, or 
have added an analytics module to 
their development offerings for HR. 
Others are investing in coaching to 
help HR professionals use and interpret 
dashboards, or have used the roll-out  
of new HR systems as an opportunity  
to train HR not just in using the 
systems, but also in helping them build 
skills to analyse the data effectively. 
Some organisations have developed 
more formal learning pathways focused 
on analytics. For example, Nicky 
Clement at Unilever said: “Our internal 
surveys have found this is one of the 
biggest skills gaps for HR. So we have 
built a learning pathway for analytics 
that anyone who wants to upskill in 
this area can follow.” Similarly, Shell

rather than starting with what data is already available. Alexis Fink said: “Simply 
relying on the data at hand is a bit like the old parable of the gentleman looking 
for his keys under the streetlamp. Others helpfully join, but can’t find the keys, 
and eventually ask if he’s sure this is where he lost them, to which he replies,

role etc. The company also added 
in data from its internally developed 
employee sentiment analysis tool called 
Social Pulse, which monitors posts and 
comments made by employees on 
Connections (IBM’s internal social media 
platform). Data from Social Pulse was 
included based on the hypothesis that 
an employee’s engagement with social 
media might fall when they are thinking 
of leaving the firm.
David Green said: “Building the 
algorithm is only the first stage. It’s 
helpful to understand what’s driving 
people to leave, but it doesn’t actually 
help resolve the problem.” The next 
stage was to test whether it was 
possible to identify people at risk of 
resigning, with a reasonable degree of 
accuracy and reliability and far enough 
in advance to be able to do something 
about it. Green said: “Now we can not 
only identify those at risk six to nine 
months out, we also prescribe what the 
next best action will be. That might, for 
example, be a pay rise out of the usual

While it touches on a specific technological implementation, it focuses on a very narrow, tactical detail about a single company's approach to social media monitoring. The question lacks broader strategic insights and doesn't provide meaningful information about workforce analytics methodologies, best practices, or scalable approaches. 

The specificity about IBM's tool reduces its applicability across different organizations, and it doesn't address the more substantive aspects of workforce analytics such as:
- How social media engagement can be strategically measured
- The broader implications of employee digital interactions
- Methodologies for tracking workforce insights
- Ethical considerations in employee monitoring

While potentially interesting as a very specific piece of trivia, this question does not contribute significantly to understanding strategic workforce analytics. It would be of minimal value to HR professionals, people analytics specialists, or business leaders seeking to develop comprehensive workforce analytics capabilities."
93,What key principles should guide workforce analytics efforts?,Core principles for WF analytics effectiveness?,"The key principles guiding workforce analytics efforts should be: start with critical business priorities and challenges, avoid analyzing data for its own sake, focus on generating insights that lead to actionable interventions, and ensure key stakeholders are committed to acting on those insights to create business success.","Start with the key business priorities and pressing business problems that have the potential to be addressed through data.
Avoid analysing data for its own sake.
HR succeeds by adding value to business decisions – by informing how to make business decisions that intervene and create business success.
Analysis is only one step in the process.
Insights are valuable only if they lead to action, which requires not only strong analytics capability, but also a commitment by key stakeholders in the business to act on those insights and see them through.","performance, this may not be the 
best place to focus effort. According 
to Lorenzo Canlas, formerly Head of 
Talent Analytics at LinkedIn: “Predicting 
attrition is interesting, but what do we 
do with it? Is there anything we can 
do to reduce the risk of those people 
leaving? Are they in business critical 
roles? Without additional information, 
predicting who will leave next year is 
merely informative.”
As we discuss in the rest of this report, 
workforce analytics has to be focused 
if it is to avoid being a fad.
• Start with the key business 
priorities and pressing business 
problems that have the potential 
to be addressed through data. 
These might include how to improve 
performance or productivity, reduce 
costs or build the organisation’s 
capacity to innovate.
• Avoid analysing data for its own 
sake. “Analytics too often starts 
with data, when it should start with 
business challenges (hence all the 
analytics cases linking survey data to 
turnover because the data is readily 
available). HR succeeds by adding 
value to business decisions – by 
informing how to make business 
decisions that intervene and create 
business success.” (Rasmussen and 
Ulrich, 2015).
• Analysis is only one step in the  
process. Insights are valuable only if 
they lead to action, which requires 
not only strong analytics capability, 
but also a commitment by key 
stakeholders in the business to act 
on those insights and see them 
through. “[Workforce analytics] offers",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context provides clear and specific guidance on key principles for workforce analytics, including starting with business priorities, avoiding data analysis for its own sake, focusing on actionable insights, and ensuring that analytics efforts are tied to creating business value.",5,"This is an excellent, high-value question for strategic workforce analytics. It directly addresses fundamental methodology and strategic implementation considerations that are critical for organizations developing or enhancing their workforce analytics capabilities. The question seeks core guiding principles, which implies a desire to understand the foundational approach to workforce analytics rather than just tactical details.

The question is highly relevant because it:
1. Targets strategic framework development
2. Seeks fundamental principles that can guide analytics efforts across different organizational contexts
3. Implies a need for understanding best practices and systematic approach

57,What challenges do HR professionals face in workforce analytics?,Key HR analytics obstacles in workforce mgmt?,"HR professionals face challenges in workforce analytics such as lacking domain knowledge, potentially focusing too narrowly on HR metrics rather than critical business issues, and struggling to extract meaningful insights by linking multiple data sources both inside and outside HR systems, with research indicating low effectiveness in predicting and modeling organizational performance outcomes.","Lack of domain knowledge could lead to incorrect interpretation of results.
Activity can be too focused on 'HR for HR's sake', and end up being too far removed from the business.

Extracting business insights usually requires linking multiple data sources from inside and outside HR systems.
Often, HR functions lack access to the business data they need to make meaningful connections between people and business data.

Lack 
of domain knowledge could lead to 
incorrect interpretation of results.
Cons
• Activity can be too focused on ‘HR 
for HR’s sake’, and end up being too 
far removed from the business. For 
example, we see that a lot of workforce 
analytics projects begin with identifying 
the factors that drive employee turnover. 
This may be a critical business issue, as 
some of the case examples in Chapter 
3 show. However, often it isn’t – it’s 
merely something that you can measure 
in a reasonably straightforward way. This 
runs the risk that data availability and 
ease of analysis drive analytics decisions, 
rather than important business issues 
that need addressing.
• Extracting business insights usually 
requires linking multiple data sources 
from inside and outside HR systems. 
It can be easier to do this where 
workforce analytics is part of a wider 
business analytics function. Often, HR 
functions lack access to the business 
data they need to make meaningful 
connections between people and 
business data. Indeed, research by the 
Organizational Intelligence Institute

1. Technical challenges (data quality, integration, analytics skills)
2. Organizational challenges (cultural resistance, leadership buy-in)
3. Methodological challenges (selecting right metrics, interpreting complex data)

The question would be valuable for:
- HR leaders seeking to understand and overcome implementation barriers
- Analytics professionals developing support strategies
- Business executives understanding HR analytics transformation
- Researchers studying organizational analytics adoption

The question is practical because it:
- Directly addresses the current state of HR analytics adoption
- Offers a clear, measurable indicator of organizational analytics capabilities
- Can help identify barriers to data-driven HR practices

While not extremely complex, this question represents a valuable data point for HR leaders, analytics professionals, and business executives looking to understand and improve their organization's approach to workforce analytics. It provides a snapshot of current perceptions and potential areas for improvement in data-driven HR decision-making."
18,What are the two potential focuses of workforce analytics?,Workforce analytics' key areas of emphasis?,"The two potential focuses of workforce analytics are: (1) producing dashboards, models, and metrics as a service provider, or (2) developing data-driven solutions to strategic people-related business issues by partnering with the business to improve performance.","• Is the focus to produce dashboards, models and metrics, and gather and process data –  acting, in effect, as a service provider?
• Or is it about developing data- and evidence-driven solutions to strategic people-related business issues – thus acting as a partner working with the business to improve performance?","difference for me. It means I am much 
closer to strategic decision making, 
so I’ve got a better chance of setting 
the right priorities for my team. It also 
encourages the HR leaders to be more 
data-driven in their decision making.” 
One of the most pressing questions is: 
what is the purpose of workforce analytics 
in the organisation? This will drive many 
other decisions such as the capabilities 
required, team structure and reporting 
lines, and governance. 
Clarifying the purpose of workforce 
analytics means answering the 
following questions.
• Is the focus to produce dashboards, 
models and metrics, and gather and 
process data –  acting, in effect, as a 
service provider? 
• Or is it about developing data- and 
evidence-driven solutions to strategic 
people-related business issues – thus 
acting as a partner working with the 
business to improve performance?
If the latter, not only does the analytics 
team require the technical skills to produce 
the required outputs, but it also needs 
strong business acumen to determine 
what to prioritise, and influencing skills to 
ensure that analysis drives decision making. 
In this scenario, the job is not done until 
insights have been developed into actions 
and rolled out in the business. 
Having a clearly articulated vision and 
purpose for workforce analytics helps 
the organisation to set the direction of 
the analytics team and to communicate 
the aims and objectives of the team to 
other stakeholders.
4.1",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly and explicitly lists the two potential focuses of workforce analytics: 1) acting as a service provider producing dashboards, models, and metrics, or 2) developing data-driven solutions to strategic people-related business issues by partnering with the business to improve performance.",4,"This question is quite useful for professionals in workforce analytics and HR strategy. It seeks to understand the fundamental approaches or domains of workforce analytics, which is crucial for anyone looking to implement or leverage such analytics effectively. The question suggests an interest in understanding the core methodologies or strategic orientations of workforce analytics, which could help professionals clarify their analytical approach.

The question is relevant because it probes the foundational aspects of workforce analytics, potentially revealing key strategic focuses that organizations might adopt. While simple, it demonstrates an important information need about the scope and potential directions of workforce analytics. Professionals seeking to build or refine their analytics capabilities would find value in understanding these potential focuses.

The broad nature of the question means it could be valuable for a range of stakeholders - from junior HR analysts trying to understand the field to senior executives looking to strategically deploy workforce analytics. Its simplicity is actually a strength, as it invites a clear, concise explanation of core analytical approaches."
16,How do orgs leverage psychology depts for workforce analytics insights?,Psych dept insights for workforce analytics: how do orgs tap in?,"Organizations leverage psychology departments for workforce analytics insights by building partnerships with university psychology departments, such as Unilever's collaboration with University College London, and embedding occupational psychology experts like ING's PhD student within their people analytics teams to gain academic theory-based insights into workforce dynamics.","Some organisations have built links with university psychology departments to provide insights on the academic theory underpinning key issues being explored by the analytics function.

For example, Unilever has built a partnership with University College London, and ING has a PhD student in occupational psychology working within the people analytics team.","“Developments in behavioural science 
should be playing an important role in 
this field. For example, the correlation 
between personality dimensions such 
as conscientiousness and performance 
has been shown to be more or less the 
same across similar roles in different 
organisations. If you don’t have a strong 
research design, there’s little point trying 
to test relationships like this that have 
already been shown to exist again and 
again by occupational psychologists – 
you’re better off building on what we 
already know. You might choose to 
check whether what’s reported in the 
scientific literature plays out in your 
organisation, but you should always start 
with what the  science says. If you get a 
different result, it probably means your 
study is flawed.” 
Some organisations have built links 
with university psychology departments 
to provide insights on the academic 
theory underpinning key issues being 
explored by the analytics function. For 
example, Unilever has built a partnership 
with University College London, and 
ING has a PhD student in occupational 
psychology working within the people 
analytics team.
Step 3: Gather data
You can’t complete an analysis without 
data, but which data do you need? Each 
project will require different sets of data, 
depending on the nature of the issue 
that’s being analysed. The following 
questions can help determine how to 
approach data gathering.
• Existing or new data? Our interviewees",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,3,"The context provides a limited but specific example of organizations like Unilever and ING collaborating with university psychology departments by partnering with UCL and embedding a PhD student in their people analytics team, which partially answers the question but lacks comprehensive details about how such collaborations are typically structured or leveraged for workforce analytics insights.",3,"This question has moderate usefulness for workforce analytics stakeholders. While it explores an intriguing interdisciplinary approach by considering how psychological insights might enhance workforce analytics, the phrasing is somewhat vague. The potential value lies in understanding how psychological research and methodologies could provide deeper insights into workforce behavior, talent assessment, employee engagement, and predictive analytics.

The question touches on an innovative angle of workforce analytics by suggesting collaboration between psychology and data analytics departments. This could be valuable for:
- HR professionals seeking more nuanced understanding of employee dynamics
- People analytics specialists looking to incorporate behavioral science
- Organizations wanting to develop more sophisticated talent strategies

However, the question lacks specificity about exactly how psychology might be leveraged, which limits its immediate practical application. A more targeted question about specific psychological frameworks or research methods applicable to workforce analytics would be more useful.

The conversational phrasing doesn't detract from the underlying interesting information need, but it would benefit from more precise framing. Overall, it represents a thought-provoking but not fully developed inquiry into potential interdisciplinary approaches to workforce analytics."

While it seeks a specific quantitative insight about HR analytics team structures, the value is somewhat limited. The question provides a snapshot of current reporting practices, which could be interesting for benchmarking and understanding organizational approaches to analytics. 

Strengths:
- Offers a data point about current HR analytics team configurations
- Could help organizations compare their own team structures
- Provides insight into how widespread analytics reporting is across different organizations

Limitations:
- Lacks depth about the strategic implications of reporting structures
- Doesn't explore the effectiveness or quality of analytics teams
- Provides a static percentage without context about team capabilities or maturity

For HR professionals and workforce analytics specialists, this question might offer a basic reference point, but it doesn't deeply explore the strategic implementation or impact of workforce analytics. It's more of a descriptive statistic than a transformative insight. The practical value is moderate, as it could inform organizational design discussions but doesn't provide actionable guidance for improving analytics capabilities."

Figure 7.
• Internal only, or internal and external 
data sources? External data sources 
such as demographic and economic 
data, business surveys, LinkedIn data 
or published scientific research, can 
be extremely valuable.
• Perfect or ‘good enough’ data? It’s 
easy to get caught in a never-ending 
cycle of cleaning data, without 
moving on to meaningful analysis. 
“A good data scientist understands 
when data cleaning reaches the point 
of diminishing returns, at which point 
it’s time to get on with the analysis”. 
(Levenson and Fink, 2017). Dave 
Millner, Executive Consulting Partner 
at IBM Workforce Science, said: 
“Often, HR people think the data need 
to be 100% right. While that’s true for 
some types of people data, when it 
comes to workforce analytics, 80% 
right is usually good enough. You 
need enough good quality data to be 
able to make meaningful connections 
and tell a coherent story.”
• 
Quantitative or qualitative data? 
Analytics does not always require 
crunching together large data sets using 
complicated mathematical formulae 
or sophisticated statistics software 
packages. Sometimes the opinions of 
key stakeholders can be as valuable as 
‘big data’. Alexis Fink, General Manager, 
Talent Intelligence & Analytics at Intel, 
said: “It’s tying together quantitative 
and qualitative data that usually leads 
to better insights. Qualitative data tells 
you the story behind what you observe",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,3,"The context mentions that 45% disagreed with data-driven decisions, which directly addresses part of the question, but the context does not specify that these are specifically HR professionals, leaving some uncertainty about the precise scope of the statistic.",2,"
This question has limited usefulness for strategic workforce analytics for several reasons:

1. Relevance: While the question touches on a workforce-related topic, it lacks depth and strategic insight. It appears to be a surface-level survey statistic without providing meaningful context or actionable intelligence.

2. Practicality: The percentage of HR professionals disagreeing with data-driven decisions doesn't inherently provide value for improving workforce analytics practices or understanding implementation challenges.

3. Information Need: The question fails to explore the underlying reasons for potential resistance, which would be more informative. It doesn't probe into why HR professionals might be hesitant about data-driven approaches or how to address such concerns.

4. Applicability: There's minimal strategic value in knowing a raw percentage without understanding the context, reasons, or potential solutions for overcoming resistance to data-driven decision-making.

A more useful question would explore:
- Barriers to adopting data-driven HR practices
- Strategies for building data literacy in HR
- Reasons behind resistance to workforce analytics
- How to effectively integrate data-driven approaches in HR decision-making

The current question provides a potentially interesting but ultimately superficial statistic that offers little substantive insight for workforce analytics professionals.

73,What drives business performance in workforce analytics?,Key drivers of WF analytics' biz performance?,"Workforce analytics drives business performance by identifying key performance drivers and focusing on improving people-related elements through strategies like better job design and more effective incentives, while ensuring that analytics leads to actionable insights and practical recommendations.","Workforce analytics needs to focus on identifying the drivers of business performance, and working out how to improve the people-related elements of those drivers through, for example, better job design or more effective incentives.","the proportion of annual appraisals 
completed may be interesting, 
but it’s only relevant if improving it 
leads to better business outcomes. 
Workforce analytics needs to focus 
on identifying the drivers of business 
performance, and working out 
how to improve the people-related 
elements of those drivers through, for 
example, better job design or more 
effective incentives. 
• Analytics is only as valuable as the 
actions that it prompts. Establishing a 
correlation between two factors is not, 
on its own, enough: there needs to be 
a clear ‘so what?’ in terms of practical 
recommendations and an agreed 
implementation plan. 
• There’s a perception (or 
misconception) that the quality and 
availability of data is one of the biggest 
barriers for organisations. The analytics 
maturity curves promoted by many 
consultancies suggest that you have to 
focus on cleaning data and mastering 
basic reporting before you can do 
more sophisticated analysis. This is 
unhelpful: you sometimes have to 
generate new data in order to uncover 
useful insights, perhaps through 
employee surveys or qualitative 
interviews with business stakeholders, 
and you can do this without having 
to fix legacy data in the HR system. 
The right approach is to start with 
the business questions to be tackled 
and from there determine what data 
you need, rather than asking ‘what 
questions can we answer with the data 
at hand?’ And even when legacy data 
is used for analysis, it is never the right",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,3,"The context provides some insights into workforce analytics and business performance, suggesting that identifying drivers of performance and focusing on people-related elements like job design and incentives are important, but does not comprehensively explain specific drivers of business performance.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics, addressing a fundamental concern for organizations seeking to understand the connection between workforce data and business outcomes. The question probes the core drivers of performance, which is crucial for HR professionals, business leaders, and analytics specialists.

The question's strength lies in its broad yet focused approach:
1. Relevance: Directly relates to strategic workforce analytics by exploring performance causation
2. Practicality: Seeks actionable insights into how workforce analytics can drive tangible business results
3. Information Need: Represents a critical strategic inquiry about connecting people data to organizational performance
4. Applicability: Would help organizations understand how to leverage workforce analytics for competitive advantage

While the question is somewhat general, it opens the door to exploring key factors like talent capabilities, workforce engagement, skills alignment, and data-driven decision-making. It encourages a holistic view of how workforce analytics can be more than just a reporting tool, but a strategic lever for business performance.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it could be more specific about the type of performance or specific drivers being investigated. However, its broad nature also makes it versatile and applicable across different organizational contexts."

table. For example, ‘this group is likely 
to feel less happy than others about 
their jobs, their supervisors, their career 
prospects and so on’. You might need 
a high-powered regression analysis 
to validate the model of employee 
turnover, but you can and should 
illustrate the results using more basic 
comparisons that the audience can 
easily understand.
Step 5: Reveal insights
The results of the analysis may be 
interesting, but it has to deliver clear 
and relevant insights that you can act 
on for it to be of value. Raw data or 
analysis without interpretation will not 
be helpful to business leaders. You 
need to interpret the analysis for them 
in a way that they can then act on. 
“The data you need to make strategic decisions doesn’t have to be perfect.”",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly quotes Van der Togt and Rasmussen (2017) stating that ""Decent management information often already generates 80% of the value without sophisticated analytics"", which precisely answers the question about the percentage of value generated by decent management information.",3,"
The question has moderate usefulness for workforce analytics stakeholders. While it touches on a potentially interesting topic of management information value, the phrasing is somewhat vague and lacks precision. 

Strengths:
- Implies interest in quantifying the strategic impact of management information
- Could be relevant to understanding the ROI of workforce analytics initiatives

Weaknesses:
- ""Decent management info"" is an imprecise term
- The percentage value is not clearly defined (value in what context - cost savings, productivity, decision-making?)
- Lacks specificity about the type of management information or analytics being referenced

For workforce analytics professionals, this question might prompt further investigation, but would require significant clarification to be truly actionable. It hints at an important concept (measuring the value of management information) but doesn't provide enough context to be immediately useful.

A more precise version might be: ""How can we quantify the strategic value generated by workforce analytics insights?"" This would more clearly align with strategic workforce analytics objectives.

This question is highly valuable for strategic workforce analytics professionals and business leaders. It represents a concrete, real-world example of how predictive analytics can be applied to address a critical HR challenge - talent retention. The question:

1. Relevance: Directly relates to workforce analytics methodology and practical application, showing how data-driven insights can solve talent management problems.

2. Practicality: Addresses a common and significant organizational challenge of reducing critical talent turnover, which is a key strategic concern for most companies.

3. Information Need: Seeks specific insights into how a leading global organization successfully implemented predictive analytics to manage talent, offering potential best practices and learnings.

4. Applicability: Would provide actionable intelligence for HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders looking to understand how predictive analytics can be used strategically in talent management.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it focuses on a specific case study, which might limit broader generalizability. However, case studies are extremely valuable for understanding practical implementation of workforce analytics strategies.

Step 8: Implement and evaluate
Analysis that does not drive decision

sure the recommendations are followed 
through with action is a significant 
challenge for many analytics initiatives. 
This is especially true where projects are 
led by analytics experts who sit in a silo 
within the HR function, without business 
sponsorship or direct accountability.
Our research highlighted some practical 
ways of addressing this challenge.

Storytelling is a critical skill for data analytics professionals, as it helps transform complex data and statistical findings into compelling narratives that can drive decision-making. In workforce analytics specifically, the ability to craft meaningful stories from data can:

1. Make complex workforce insights more accessible to non-technical stakeholders
2. Help business leaders understand the strategic implications of workforce data
3. Translate numerical findings into actionable business recommendations
4. Increase engagement and buy-in for data-driven HR and talent strategies

While the question is somewhat broad and not exclusively focused on workforce analytics, it addresses a fundamental communication challenge in data analytics across disciplines. The information need is genuine, and the question would be valuable for HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders who want to improve their data communication skills.

GSK
When GSK’s new CEO, Emma Walmsley, 
took over in April 2017, she was keen 
to understand how the company’s 
leadership style and behaviours 
affected the mood and performance 
of the business. Tim Haynes, Global 
Head of Organisation and People 
Analytics, worked with his team to 
provide a comprehensive set of data 
to GSK’s executive team showing how 
their leadership was perceived in the 
organisation, both as individuals and 
collectively, and what leadership ‘shadow’ 
they were therefore casting across the 
company. The data included insights 
from employee surveys, 360-degree 
feedback each leader had received, 
and other employee feedback, going 
back over several years. Based on this 
information, the executive team had a 
series of conversations about how they 
are perceived, agreed actions to shift 
their collective behaviour to support a 
new strategic direction, and set clear 
expectations around how they should 
work together as a team. 
Haynes’ team is now working on a 
culture dashboard, which combines 
structured and unstructured data to take 
a temperature check of the culture. “If 
the CEO were to ask: ‘What’s the current 
mood of the workforce in GSK?’, I think

effectively (‘employee utilisation’) to meet its financial objectives. 
Enterprise/business unit/function/team issues. The company’s intermediate objective is to improve client

are committed to supporting their business unit’s objectives.
People/role issues. Employees are pushed to provide the highest possible client service while minimising the 
fixed cost per employee. This means increasing employees’ commitment to their teams as far as is possible.

WORKFORCE ANALYTICS – KEY ENABLER OF STRATEGY EXECUTION OR MANAGEMENT FAD? 
“The popular literature on HR analytics currently resembles more hype than substance, and 
consultancies and software suppliers have spotted the commercial opportunity, more often than 
not amplifying the noise rather than clarifying the purpose. It is at risk of becoming a fad.”
 Van der Togt and Rasmussen, 2017
The history of HR is littered with 
initiatives, tools and ‘best practices’ 
that over-promised and under-
delivered. HR ‘solutions’ that fail to 
take account of the organisation 
context and strategic priorities are 
at risk of being fads that generate 
substantial interest without improving 
organisational performance. So far, the 
rapid advances in the analytics tools 
available to business leaders and HR 
professionals are outstripping their 
ability to use them to solve the most 
pressing business challenges. 
We’ve seen some examples of 
improved performance through 
analytics, but there are many others 
that, while interesting, aren’t necessarily 
focused on key business issues. For 
example, analytics that focus on the 
performance of the HR department are 
largely irrelevant to people outside HR. 
We’ve found that many organisations 
begin their analytics journey by building 
models that can predict attrition – 
but unless high turnover is a key risk 
or substantial handicap to business 
performance, this may not be the 
best place to focus effort. According",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly addresses the question by quoting a source suggesting HR analytics risks becoming a fad, and provides multiple supporting arguments about how HR analytics initiatives often over-promise, lack strategic focus, and may not effectively solve key business challenges.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics as it probes a critical meta-level concern about the discipline's long-term credibility and sustainable value. While phrased provocatively, it addresses an important strategic consideration for HR and analytics professionals:

1. Relevance: Directly addresses the strategic positioning and perceived value of HR analytics, which is crucial for understanding its organizational legitimacy.

2. Practicality: Explores a genuine concern about whether HR analytics is a substantive strategic capability or just a passing trend. This reflects real discussions happening in advanced analytics organizations.

3. Information Need: Seeks insights into the maturity, effectiveness, and strategic potential of HR analytics as a discipline. This requires nuanced analysis of implementation, outcomes, and organizational impact.

4. Applicability: Would be valuable for HR leaders, analytics professionals, and business executives considering investments in workforce analytics capabilities. It encourages critical reflection on the discipline's strategic merit.

The question invites a sophisticated examination of HR analytics' theoretical foundations, empirical evidence of impact, and potential for creating genuine organizational value. While slightly skeptical in tone, it represents a legitimate and important inquiry into the field's strategic significance."

In the second half of this chapter 
we highlight some stories about 
performance improvements 
organisations have made using 
workforce analytics. However, such 
stories are few and far between because 
most organisations are in the very early 
stages of developing their capability 
in this field. Our survey showed that 
it’s early days for workforce analytics. 
21% of respondents have just started 
to invest in building analytics capability 
in HR, a further 30% have made 
some investment, and 13% are only at 
the stage of thinking about building 
capability. Nearly one-quarter (24%) 
have made further progress but still 
have some way to go. A mere 7% judge 
their organisation to be reasonably 
advanced, having deployed workforce 
analytics successfully in various parts of 
the business. Interestingly, only 2% had 
backtracked on previous investments 
due to poor results or cost cutting. See 
Figure 8.
Organisations’ lack of progress in 
deploying workforce analytics to improve 
performance is disappointing. Only one-
quarter (27%) of respondents said their 
HR analytics capability allowed them 
to identify opportunities to improve 
business outcomes to a ‘reasonable’ or 
‘very great’ extent, though a further 41% 
said they had achieved this ‘to some 
extent’ (see Figure 9). Similarly, only 
14% said they had used HR analytics

3. Analytics specialists understanding market penetration of workforce analytics
4. Researchers tracking the maturity of workforce analytics capabilities

The question provides insight into the prevalence and implementation success of workforce analytics, which can help organizations gauge their own progress and learn from industry benchmarks. While somewhat broad, it captures a critical strategic information need about the current landscape of workforce analytics deployment.

The practicality is strong, as understanding adoption rates can inform investment decisions, strategy development, and organizational capabilities. It represents a quantitative approach to understanding the strategic implementation of workforce analytics across different industries and organization sizes."

Clarks
Shoe retailer Clarks has used analytics to 
optimise the rewards package on offer 
to employees. The company surveyed 
employees using conjoint analysis, 
which requires respondents to express 
a preference between two different 
variables. It then ran focus groups to 
build a more detailed picture of what 
the analysis showed. By asking which 
benefits employees might be prepared to 
trade off, it built a much more granular 
view of what people truly valued, and 
adjusted the package accordingly. 
Belinda Deery, Chief People Officer, said 
that the analysis challenged a number 
of assumptions that the company might 
otherwise have made, and resulted in a 
reduction in the overall cost of benefits. 
“We found that satisfaction could be 
increased by 15 percentage points by 
taking actions such as giving people 
£500 to invest in their development, 
instead of offering a bonus. Employees 
also wanted to be able to buy holiday,

This question is quite valuable for strategic workforce analytics professionals. It represents a specific, real-world case study of how analytics can be applied to employee compensation and rewards strategy. The question demonstrates:

1. Relevance: Directly relates to using workforce analytics for compensation optimization, which is a critical area of strategic HR analytics.

2. Practicality: Seeks insights into a concrete application of analytics in designing employee rewards, which is a key concern for HR and business leaders trying to attract and retain talent.

3. Information Need: Indicates a desire to understand the practical methodology of applying data-driven approaches to compensation design, which can provide valuable learning for other organizations.

4. Applicability: Would be highly useful for HR professionals, compensation specialists, and analytics teams looking to understand how advanced analytics can inform rewards strategy.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it's very specific to one company's approach, which might limit broader generalizability. However, case studies like this are still extremely valuable for understanding real-world analytics implementation.

This question has moderate usefulness for workforce analytics stakeholders. While it references a specific survey statistic about HR professionals' skills, which could be interesting, it has some limitations:

Strengths:
- Highlights a critical issue of skill gaps in workforce analytics
- References an actual industry survey, suggesting empirical research
- Provides a quantitative perspective on HR analytics capabilities

Limitations:
- The data is from 2017, which makes it potentially outdated
- Focuses on a narrow statistical point rather than deeper insights
- Doesn't explore the implications of the skill gap or strategies to address it

For HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and workforce planners, this question could serve as a starting point for discussing skill development and capability building. However, it lacks depth in terms of actionable insights or strategic recommendations.

The question would be more valuable if it:
- Compared skills across different years
- Explored reasons behind the skill gaps
- Suggested strategies for upskilling HR professionals in analytics

Overall, it's a moderately useful question that provides a snapshot of HR analytics skills, but doesn't offer comprehensive strategic guidance.

analytics process needs to shift its perspective from ‘I’m going to give you some insights’ to ‘I’m 
going to help you decide what actions to take’.”

The question is practical because it:
1. Focuses on the effectiveness of analytics implementation
2. Explores the link between HR data and broader business outcomes
3. Implies an interest in measuring the strategic impact of workforce analytics

While slightly broad, the question touches on several important dimensions of workforce analytics:
- Predictive capabilities
- Organizational maturity in analytics
- Connection between human capital and business performance

For HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders, this question represents a fundamental inquiry into how data can be transformed into strategic insights.

Deloitte survey found that executives 
surveyed generally had a dim view 
of the function’s capacity to deliver 
analytics projects (see Figure 24). Many 
organisations have built dashboards 
and reporting systems that put data 
directly in the hands of HR professionals

WORKFORCE ANALYTICS – KEY ENABLER OF STRATEGY EXECUTION OR MANAGEMENT FAD? 
HR and ‘big data’
Think about analytics, and the term ‘big data’ often follows close behind. But what is big data, and what does it mean for workforce analytics?
The term ‘big data’ refers to data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing systems are unable to deal with them. Gartner defines big data as 
high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing, which enable enhanced 
insight, decision making and process automation. Big data analysis tools and techniques are helping companies to, among other things, better understand consumer 
behaviour and improve their business processes. For example, Google is able to mine the data generated by someone’s search history to deliver relevant targeted 
advertising to them. And aeroplane engines are now equipped with an array of internet-enabled sensors that send a constant stream of data to the manufacturer, 
allowing maintenance to be scheduled exactly when it’s needed. 
But are we seeing a big data revolution in workforce analytics and, if so, what implications does this have for the capabilities we need to build in HR and the tools we 
need to invest in? Workforce analytics does sometimes involve manipulating big data sets – for example, when analysing posts on internal social media networks – but",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,3,"The context provides a partial answer by giving two specific examples of how big data helps companies improve business processes (Google using search history for targeted advertising and manufacturers using sensor data to schedule precise aircraft maintenance), but the explanation is limited and does not offer a comprehensive overview of how big data improves business processes.",3,"This question has moderate relevance to strategic workforce analytics, but lacks specificity. While big data is a critical component of workforce analytics, the question is too broad and generic. It doesn't directly focus on workforce or human capital implications, which would make it more valuable. 

The question could be more targeted by:
- Specifying business processes related to human capital
- Focusing on how data analytics specifically impacts workforce management
- Exploring concrete examples of data-driven process improvements in HR and talent management

Strengths:
- Acknowledges the role of data in business improvement
- Shows interest in understanding how analytics can drive organizational effectiveness

Weaknesses:
- Too general to provide deep insights into workforce analytics
- Lacks context specific to human capital and talent strategies
- Does not highlight the strategic potential of workforce data

For maximum usefulness, the question would benefit from more precision about the specific business processes, the type of data being analyzed, and the direct link to workforce performance and strategic objectives."

BUILDING A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYTICS WITH STRATEGIC IMPACT AT ITS HEART
1. Competitive advantage analytics
This stage focuses on the sources 
of competitive advantage for your 
organisation – how do you make 
money and preserve your position 
in the marketplace? Competitive 
advantage derives from the 
organisational capabilities that enable 
strategic goals to be achieved – things 
like brand strength, superior products 
or distribution, price competitiveness 
or capacity for innovation. 
The analysis involves (a) identifying the 
organisational strengths and weaknesses 
that define competitive advantage; (b) 
building a causal model that lays out the 
details; and (c) aligning key stakeholders 
behind the need for analysis. This 
allows you to identify where strategy 
execution can best be improved. Is it 
better customer retention? Improved 
innovation? Increased market share? 
Competitive advantage analysis 
helps organisations choose between 
interventions likely to deliver the greatest 
return on investment.  
Complex statistical analysis is almost 
never used at this stage. Qualitative 
analysis, based on interviews with key 
stakeholders, is likely to be sufficient. 
Key questions for competitive 
advantage analytics 
• What problems are you trying to 
solve with your analysis?
• How would the analysis results 
help improve strategy execution?
• What organisational barriers to the 
successful execution of strategy 
do key stakeholders perceive?",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context directly lists the key questions for competitive advantage analytics verbatim, providing a complete and precise answer to the question with three specific bullet points about problem identification, analysis results, and organizational barriers.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics, focusing specifically on competitive advantage analytics - a critical area for organizations seeking to leverage workforce data strategically.

Key strengths of this question include:
1. Relevance: Directly addresses a strategic application of workforce analytics
2. Practicality: Seeks actionable insights for understanding competitive positioning through workforce data
3. Applicability: Would be valuable for HR professionals, business leaders, and strategic planners looking to use analytics as a competitive differentiator

The question implies an interest in understanding how workforce analytics can:
- Identify unique talent capabilities
- Benchmark against industry competitors
- Develop strategic talent strategies that create organizational advantages

While slightly broad, the question shows a strategic mindset about using workforce analytics beyond traditional reporting, making it a strong candidate for in-depth exploration in a workforce analytics context. The phrasing suggests a desire to move from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive analytics approaches."

• The availability and affordability of 
increasingly sophisticated and user-
friendly analytics tools, combined

When you have, typically, an analytics team of three to five people, if they also have responsibility for reporting, there's no capacity left for more strategic analytics – it can easily get crowded out by reporting.","If they are part of the same team, 
it’s important to establish a clear 
boundary between the different sets 
of resources, because reporting can 
easily take up all the available capacity. 
Several interviewees pointed out that 
it’s particularly important to ring-fence 
capacity for analytics work when the 
analytics function is in its infancy.
Regardless of whether reporting and 
analytics are managed together or 
separately, there is a strong argument 
for drawing clear boundaries that 
protect the analytics professionals from 
being drawn into reporting requests. 
For example, one company expressly 
barred its workforce analysts, for their 
own sake, from using reporting tools. If 
a stakeholder asked them for a report, 
they had a legitimate excuse for refusing 
and referring them to the reporting 
team instead. Haig Nalbantian said: 
“When you have, typically, an analytics 
team of three to five people, if they also 
have responsibility for reporting, there’s 
no capacity left for more strategic 
analytics – it can easily get crowded out

Some organisations have invested in 
automated reporting and dashboards, 
so that managers can find the basic 
reporting and metrics information 
they need themselves. This allows the 
analytics team to focus on higher value-
adding analysis. Nicky Clement’s team 
at Unilever has developed and maintains

WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE AND APPLICATION OF WORKFORCE ANALYTICS?
“You don’t need to expend the same degree of effort on retention in every area of the business. 
Focus on identifying those parts of the workforce that have greatest impact on the business, 
which are most difficult to hire, train, replace or retain, and focus your energy there.”
Julian Holmes, Director, OrgVue
We find that many organisations start 
using workforce analytics to identify 
the causes of or predict staff turnover, 
so they can understand how to reduce 
it. Turnover is a business-critical issue 
in some organisations because it 
affects their ability to serve customers, 
manage operations or fill key roles. 
However, some companies analyse 
turnover simply because they can. Julia 
Howes said: “Often people focus on 
turnover because it’s an area where 
the availability and quality of data is 
high, and you can achieve a quick win.” 
However, it is more sensible to first 
determine whether there is a business 
case for looking at turnover, and 
embarking on analysis only if the case 
stacks up. And turnover is not always 
a bad thing. Haig Nalbantian, Senior 
Partner at Mercer, said: “Turnover can, in 
fact, help triage poor performers, open 
positions to enable career advancement 
or allow for better skills matching.”
In this section we highlight some of the current applications of workforce analytics, 
illustrated by case examples from our research. The CRF survey asked respondents",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context provides multiple detailed reasons why companies analyze workforce turnover, including identifying causes of staff turnover, predicting turnover, understanding its impact on business operations, and potentially using it as a strategic tool for performance management, though the passage does not claim to be an exhaustive list of reasons.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics, addressing a fundamental aspect of people analytics that directly impacts organizational performance. Analyzing workforce turnover is a critical practice for understanding employee retention, identifying potential issues in workplace culture, assessing talent management effectiveness, and making data-driven decisions about human capital.

The question is practical and touches on a core concern for HR professionals and business leaders. Companies analyze turnover to:
1. Understand the financial and operational costs of employee departures
2. Identify patterns in why employees leave
3. Develop targeted retention strategies
4. Assess the health of the organization's talent management approach
5. Predict and mitigate future talent risks

While the question is somewhat broad, it represents a genuine information need that would be central to any comprehensive workforce analytics strategy. It would be valuable for HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business executives seeking to understand the strategic importance of tracking and analyzing employee turnover.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it could be more specific about the strategic implications or advanced analytics techniques used in turnover analysis. However, it remains a solid, foundational question that gets to the heart of why organizations invest in workforce analytics."

The principles behind analytics are 
not new – many of the underpinning 
statistical techniques have been around 
for decades. What has changed, 
however, is the volume of data available 
(from sources such as wearable devices 
as well as more traditional corporate 
systems) and the variety of tools 
available to store, access and analyse 
both structured and unstructured data.
A number of factors are driving the 
increasing level of interest in workforce 
analytics.
• Analytics is seen as a potential 
source of competitive advantage. 
Research by Andrew McAfee and 
Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT found 
that companies that characterised 
themselves as data-driven were more 
successful than those that didn’t. 
Companies in the top one-third in 
their industry in terms of their use of 
data-driven decision making were, 
on average, 5% more productive 
and 6% more profitable than their 
competitors.
• Demand is being driven by boards and 
executive teams, who increasingly 
see the benefit of using analytics to 
improve performance. According to 
Guenole, Ferrar and Feinzig (2017): 
“Generally, boards are paying much 
greater attention to their fiduciary 
obligations, and they are realising 
that the people in their businesses 
represent an asset at risk that needs to 
be actively managed. They see human 
capital as a topic worthy of board 
attention.” Several of our interviewees 
report an increased demand from 
their executive teams for data-driven",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context provides specific, quantitative information about how data-driven companies perform compared to their competitors, noting that such companies are 5% more productive and 6% more profitable on average, which directly addresses the question about comparative performance.",3,"This question has moderate usefulness for workforce analytics stakeholders. While it touches on an important comparative aspect of data-driven organizations, the phrasing is somewhat broad and lacks specificity. The question suggests an interest in understanding competitive advantages through data-driven approaches, which is relevant to strategic workforce analytics.

- Implies interest in how data analytics can create competitive differentiation
- Potentially seeks insights into organizational performance and strategic capabilities
- Could be valuable for benchmarking and understanding analytics maturity

Limitations:
- The question is too general and lacks precision about specific workforce metrics or capabilities
- Does not specify whether the comparison is about workforce analytics specifically or broader data strategies
- Requires more context to be truly actionable for workforce analytics professionals

2. Intervention design and effectiveness
3. Predictive analytics for talent management
4. Organizational behavior and employee engagement

While the question is somewhat broad, it demonstrates a practical information need that could provide valuable insights for:
- HR professionals developing targeted employee support programs
- People analytics specialists seeking to measure intervention effectiveness
- Business leaders looking to improve workforce productivity and engagement

The question's strength lies in its focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms that make job interventions successful, which requires sophisticated data analysis and strategic thinking. It suggests a desire to move beyond generic approaches to more nuanced, data-driven workforce interventions.

114,What risks exist when diving into data without clear business hypotheses?,Potential pitfalls of hypothesis-free data exploration?,"Diving into data without clear business hypotheses risks conducting unfocused analytics that may not address critical business issues, potentially wasting resources and failing to generate meaningful insights due to a lack of strategic direction and targeted investigation.",One of the biggest risks in analytics projects is being tempted to dive straight into the data before having a really clear list of the critical business issues and developing a comprehensive list of hypotheses around those business issues.,"a hypothesis as “a supposition or 
proposed explanation made on the 
basis of limited evidence as a starting 
point for further investigation.” 
An example might be: “Graduates 
are higher performers than non-
graduates.” Hypotheses can be tested 
to discover what’s underlying the 
issue – for example, “We are losing our 
best people because we are paying 
less than competitors” – or to test 
the effect of a policy change – for 
example, “If we provide all employees 
with a fitness tracker, we will reduce 
our healthcare bill.” 
One of the biggest risks in analytics 
projects is being tempted to dive 
straight into the data before having a 
really clear list of the critical business 
issues and developing a comprehensive 
list of hypotheses around those 
business issues. 
You can use existing research to 
determine which hypotheses to analyse. 
“The questions that really matter have 
been under investigation longer than 
most other business topics. What 
determines a good hire, for example, 
has been studied in almost the same 
way since WWI” (Cappelli, 2017). It is 
therefore extremely important that 
those responsible for analytics are aware 
of relevant research in organisational 
psychology and other fields that 
might have a bearing on the business 
questions they are testing. 
Nigel Guenole, Executive Consultant 
at IBM and one of the authors of 
The Power of People (2017), said: 
“Developments in behavioural science 
should be playing an important role in",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context directly addresses the risks of diving into data without clear business hypotheses, specifically highlighting that one of the ""biggest risks in analytics projects is being tempted to dive straight into the data before having a really clear list of the critical business issues and developing a comprehensive list of hypotheses"", which provides substantial information to answer most aspects of the question.",5,"This is an excellent, high-value question for strategic workforce analytics professionals. It directly addresses a critical methodological challenge in data analytics - the risk of conducting unfocused or poorly scoped data exploration. The question demonstrates sophisticated understanding that data analysis isn't just about collecting information, but about having clear strategic objectives and hypotheses.

The question is highly relevant because it:
1. Highlights the importance of purposeful data investigation
2. Signals awareness that random data mining can lead to misleading or irrelevant insights
3. Suggests a strategic approach to workforce analytics that begins with clear business questions
4. Invites discussion of potential pitfalls in data analysis methodology

For HR professionals, people analytics specialists, and business leaders, this question represents a sophisticated approach to data utilization. It implies understanding that workforce analytics should be driven by specific business needs and hypotheses, not just data availability. The question would prompt valuable discussions about:
- Avoiding confirmation bias
- Preventing wasted analytical resources
- Ensuring data exploration connects to strategic objectives
- Developing rigorous analytical frameworks

The phrasing is conversational but the underlying information need is sophisticated and directly applicable to strategic workforce analytics implementation. This makes it an exceptionally useful question that cuts to the core of effective data-driven decision making."

1. Exploring a cutting-edge analytics methodology (sentiment analysis)
2. Showing interest in concrete implementation strategies
3. Highlighting how leading companies apply advanced data techniques in people analytics

The specific mention of Unilever adds credibility and grounds the question in a real organizational context. This approach helps analytics professionals and HR leaders understand how sentiment analysis can be used to:
- Gauge employee engagement
- Understand workplace culture

actions from the analysis. For example, 
you might be able to predict which of 
your top performers are at greatest risk 
of leaving the business, but unless their

Workforce analytics is a relatively new discipline, and many organisations are still in the very early 
stages of adopting analytics. Some consultancies have developed ‘maturity models’ that describe a 
typical journey that organisations follow as they implement analytics. Figure 14 shows one of the more 
commonly cited models, Bersin’s Talent Analytics Maturity Model.
In most organisations, the implementation of analytics rarely follows such a neat progression. In fact, 
according to Nigel Guenole, most organisations are likely to need all forms of workforce analytics to work 
concurrently. “Organisations don’t have to follow a linear progression through ever more sophisticated 
levels of capability. Instead, they should focus on developing the analytics capability they need to solve 
their most pressing business challenges, whether that involves reporting or predictive analytics” , he said.
Indeed, fixating on getting one level right before progressing to the next can be counter-productive. “The 
desire to move through a maturity curve is a red herring,” said Julia Howes. “The traditional advice of

• Existing or new data? Our interviewees 
for this research said that one of the 
main barriers to deploying analytics 
effectively in their organisation is the 
quality of data available. Indeed, 51% 
of respondents to the CRF survey said 
quality of HR data was a ‘reasonably’ 
or ‘highly significant’ barrier to their 
analytics efforts, and 43% said lack 
of access to, or poor quality of, 
business data was a ‘reasonably’ or 
‘highly significant’ barrier. However, 
the data required to shed light on 
the issues identified in the causal 
model may not always be available, 
so sometimes it is more effective to 
generate new data. This might mean 
interviewing stakeholders, conducting 
pulse surveys, or running experiments, 
for example. Nigel Guenole said: 
“We often see a preoccupation with 
exploring existing data, when to really 
answer questions you sometimes need 
to go out and source new data.”
“External scientific research can be very useful in helping you populate your hypothesis tree.”

While it directly relates to a critical challenge in workforce analytics - data quality - the specific focus on a percentage from a single survey limits its broader strategic value. 

The question has practical relevance because data quality is a fundamental issue in workforce analytics. HR professionals and analytics specialists consistently struggle with data integrity, completeness, and reliability. Understanding the prevalence of this challenge could help organizations benchmark their own data quality efforts.

However, the question is narrow in scope. It seeks a specific statistical data point rather than exploring the underlying reasons for data quality challenges or potential solutions. A more comprehensive question might explore why data quality is problematic, what specific types of data are most challenging, or strategies for improving HR data management.

The question would be most useful for:
- Benchmarking data quality challenges
- Understanding the widespread nature of HR data issues
- Providing context for analytics implementation strategies

While valuable, it lacks the depth of a truly strategic workforce analytics inquiry. It represents more of a tactical, descriptive data point than a transformative insight into workforce analytics capabilities."

1. Maintaining the reliability of talent forecasting
2. Ensuring continuous improvement of analytical models
3. Developing strategies for model refresh and recalibration
4. Managing organizational expectations about predictive analytics

The question demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the limitations of predictive analytics and shows interest in the technical nuances of workforce modeling. While slightly technical, it represents a genuine information need that would be valuable across multiple stakeholder groups - from technical practitioners to strategic decision-makers who depend on these models for workforce planning.

The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 5 is that it is somewhat narrowly focused on model performance rather than broader strategic implementation. However, it remains a high-value question for anyone seriously engaged in workforce analytics."

This question has moderate usefulness for workforce analytics stakeholders. While understanding the balance between reactive and proactive reporting is important, the question is somewhat narrow in scope. 

Relevance: The question touches on an important aspect of workforce analytics maturity - the extent to which reporting is responsive versus predictive. This relates to an organization's analytics capabilities and strategic approach.

Practicality: There's practical value in assessing whether an organization is primarily responding to business demands or generating forward-looking insights. However, the specific percentage is less important than understanding the underlying reporting approach.

Information Need: The question reveals a genuine interest in understanding the current state of workforce analytics reporting, which could be valuable for benchmarking and improvement efforts.

Applicability: HR professionals and analytics leaders would find some value in this question, as it speaks to the sophistication of their analytics function. However, the binary nature of reactive vs. proactive reporting limits the depth of insight.

The moderate rating reflects that while the question is relevant, it lacks the depth and strategic complexity of a truly high-impact workforce analytics inquiry. It provides a starting point for discussion but doesn't fully explore the strategic potential of workforce analytics.

2. Explores potential external support mechanisms for organizations
3. Recognizes that many organizations need external expertise to kickstart their analytics capabilities
4. Seeks strategic guidance on leveraging external resources
5. Is applicable to HR professionals, business leaders, and analytics teams considering how to build their workforce analytics function

While not a deeply technical question, it represents a genuine information need for organizations looking to mature their people analytics capabilities. The question would be particularly useful for mid-sized organizations or those in early stages of workforce analytics implementation who are seeking guidance on how to effectively begin their analytics journey."

BUILDING A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYTICS WITH STRATEGIC IMPACT AT ITS HEART
• Demonstrate the implications of 
doing nothing. Ian O’Keefe, Managing 
Director of Workforce Analytics at 
JPMorgan Chase, uses statistical 
models to predict what the outcomes 
would be if the organisation didn’t act 
on the recommendations, and shows 
these to stakeholders. “This way we 
can show them that there’s a pain in 
the business that they don’t have to 
live with.” 
• Launch experiments. Many 
organisations choose to test new 
ideas on a limited scale before rolling 
them out further, rather than taking 
a risk on a ‘big bang’ approach. For 
example, companies in the retail 
sector typically pilot new ways of 
organising work, designing jobs and/
or paying people in a limited number 
of retail store outlets, and compare 
the results to a control group of sites 
where no changes are implemented. 
Companies with multiple 
manufacturing sites, warehouses 
and/or, distribution centres will do 
the same, as will companies with 
geographically dispersed business-to-
business sales teams. More unusually, 
it’s also possible to do pilots at a 
smaller scale within a site, such as 
when Google experimented with 
ways to get its employees to eat more 
healthily. The company determined 
that shrinking the plate size in some 
of its employee restaurants, where 
free food is served, lowered food 
consumption by 5% and waste by 18%.
• Communicate successes. It’s 
important to share stories of the",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,5,"The context provides a precise and specific description of how Google reduced food consumption by shrinking plate sizes in employee restaurants, which directly and completely answers the question.",2,"While this question relates to an organizational practice, it has very limited relevance to strategic workforce analytics. The question focuses on a specific operational detail about food consumption at Google, which does not directly connect to workforce analytics methodologies, data analysis techniques, or strategic workforce planning. 

The question lacks substantive value for:
- HR professionals seeking insights into analytics strategies
- People analytics specialists looking for meaningful data approaches
- Business leaders interested in workforce optimization
- Workforce planners developing strategic capabilities

While potentially an interesting anecdote about corporate culture, this question does not provide meaningful insights into workforce analytics practices, measurement techniques, or strategic implementation. Its applicability to workforce analytics is extremely narrow, making it only marginally useful from an analytics perspective."
121,What role do HRBPs play in workforce analytics?,How do HRBPs leverage workforce analytics?,"HRBPs play a critical role in workforce analytics by identifying key business issues, educating business leaders on analytics applications, building hypotheses to test, and helping to translate data-driven insights into actionable strategies, despite often lacking a strong analytical background.","HRBPs play a critical role in identifying the business issues to focus on and in helping to educate business leaders on the potential applications of analytics.
They are also a key partner in building hypotheses to test.
Often, HR professionals need educating about how data can help them better support their business, and need help to improve their analytical and numerical skills.","predominantly originated directly from 
the business. 
• HRBPs play a critical role in identifying 
the business issues to focus on 
and in helping to educate business 
leaders on the potential applications 
of analytics. “Business leaders aren’t 
necessarily used to using data to make 
people decisions, so a partnership is 
needed between the business and 
HR to determine what HR measures 
actually drive business results,” said 
Julia Howes.
• They are also a key partner in building 
hypotheses to test. “You need to go 
through a structured process with HR 
to determine all the diff  erent factors 
to test in building your model,” said 
Howes. “And I often get the feedback 
that it’s something HR is not used to 
doing and fi  nds quite hard.”
• Often, HR professionals need 
educating about how data can help 
them better support their business, 
and need help to improve their 
analytical and numerical skills. A 
typical comment from our interviews 
was: “Many of our HRBPs don’t have 
an analytic background, and working 
with data-driven insights is not a core 
competency.”
4. Business leaders
A useful approach to getting traction 
with analytics is to identify potential 
champions in the business – business 
leaders who ‘get it’ will be advocates for 
a data-driven approach and are probably 
willing to experiment.
• It’s often necessary to educate the 
business so they know what can be 
achieved with workforce analytics. 
Brydie Lear said: “I would like to",./hr_dataset_generation/11-Strategic-Workforce-Analytics.pdf,4,"The context provides substantial information about the role of HRBPs in workforce analytics, including their critical functions of identifying business issues, educating business leaders, partnering in building hypotheses, and bridging the gap between data and HR decision-making, with only minor details potentially missing about their complete role.",4,"This question is highly relevant to strategic workforce analytics, addressing the critical intersection between HR Business Partners (HRBPs) and data-driven workforce insights. The question explores an important organizational role in implementing and leveraging workforce analytics, which is crucial for understanding how analytics capabilities are deployed across an organization.

The question is practical because HRBPs are key intermediaries between HR data, analytics teams, and business leaders. Their role in translating analytics insights, supporting data collection, and driving strategic workforce decisions is fundamental to effective workforce analytics implementation.

The query demonstrates a genuine information need about the organizational dynamics of workforce analytics. It seeks to understand how HRBPs contribute to and interact with analytics processes, which is valuable for HR professionals, analytics specialists, and business leaders looking to optimize their workforce analytics approach.

While the question is somewhat broad, it touches on an important aspect of workforce analytics strategy - the human element of data-driven HR. It would likely provide insights into how HRBPs can bridge analytical capabilities with strategic business needs, making it highly applicable to organizations seeking to mature their workforce analytics capabilities."
