The question directly addresses a concrete procedural requirement that must be systematically tracked during an employee's departure.

The question's usefulness stems from several key factors:
- It focuses on a specific, actionable administrative task
- Equipment return is a standard part of separation workflows
- Helps prevent potential loss of NASA property
- Supports proper closeout of an employee's personnel file
- Requires understanding of organizational exit procedures

While the question could be slightly more specific (e.g., specifying types of equipment or NASA-specific assets), it remains a clear and important inquiry for HR professionals processing DRP separations. The only reason it does not receive a perfect 5 rating is that it might benefit from additional context about NASA-specific equipment categories or tracking protocols."
