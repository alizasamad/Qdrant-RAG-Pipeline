Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf .

Geršak explained that the robot used was the first true robot in the history of robotic surgery , meaning the user interface was not resembling surgical instruments and the robot was not simply imitating the movement of human hands but was guided by pressing buttons , just like one would play a video game .

Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel . Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts , practices , theological positions , and forms of organization . The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide , Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world . </P> <P> Within Judaism there are a variety of movements , most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism , which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah . Historically , this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period ; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period ; and among segments of the,Torah , in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation . Finally , David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement . </P> <H2> Jewish religious texts </H2> <P> The following is a basic , structured list of the central works of Jewish practice and thought . </P> <Ul> <Li> Tanakh ( Hebrew Bible ) and Rabbinic literature <Ul> <Li> Mesorah </Li> <Li> Targum </Li> <Li> Jewish Biblical exegesis ( also see Midrash below ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Works of the Talmudic Era ( classic rabbinic literature ) <Ul> <Li> Mishnah and commentaries </Li> <Li> Tosefta and the minor tractates </Li> <Li> Talmud : <Ul> <Li> The Babylonian Talmud and commentaries </Li> <Li> Jerusalem Talmud and commentaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Midrashic literature :,a much more emphatic knowledge of God based on experience . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Jewish Sacred Texts '' .

what was uncle jesse's original last name on full house,Cochran,His last name was Cochran.,"["", as other kids teased him for it ; so when he was in kindergarten , he begged his parents to have his name changed to Jesse , thinking that one had to have a `` cool name '' to be in the in - crowd . As an adult , he was more confident with his true name , telling the girls about the Greek god of speed , and how his great - grandfather saved a village from a volcano , but still goes by Jesse . </P> <P> In contrast with Danny , Jesse is portrayed as being irresponsible most of the time , but occasionally serves as a responsible adult when a responsible adult is needed ( such as when he discovers Stephanie 's classmate is a child abuse victim in the season 6 episode `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) . Jesse is revealed as a high school dropout in season six 's `` Educating Jesse '' , though in an earlier plot ( in season four 's `` One Last Kiss '' ) about a high school reunion , he mentions not wearing his cap to his graduation because he did not want to mess up his hair . </P> <P> Jesse,Brotherton , Ashley Liao and Adam Hagenbuch are credited after the opening credits and only for the episodes in which they appear . </P> <P> ^ Note 2 : Scott Weinger is credited as a Special Guest Star in the sixth episode of season two but as starring in all of his other appearances . </P> <H3> Jesse Katsopolis </H3> <P> Jesse Katsopolis ( portrayed by John Stamos ; the character 's last name in season one was Cochran , but was changed reportedly due to John Stamos wanting his character to better reflect his Greek heritage ) is Danny 's brother - in - law , Pam 's younger brother , husband of Rebecca Donaldson and father of twin sons Nicky and Alex . Born Hermes Katsopolis ( as revealed in the season five episode `` The Legend of Ranger Joe '' ) , he was named after his great - grandfather , who in turn is named after the Greek god of swiftness . However , he did not like his birth name , as other kids teased him for it ; so when he was in kindergarten , he begged his parents to have,not wearing his cap to his graduation because he did not want to mess up his hair . </P> <P> Jesse 's obsession with his hair becomes a major trait of his throughout the series , as well as his obsession with Elvis Presley . His obsession with the former is fully established in the season two premiere `` Cutting it Close '' , which focuses on Jesse 's tough time coping when Stephanie accidentally cuts off a hunk of his mullet , which leads to him getting into a motorcycle accident that lands him in a full arm cast ; later episodes reveal that he has a special comb called Mr. Goodpart ( which gets damaged in a melee to purchase a Mighty Mutant Super Kids Super Fortress for Michelle in season eight 's `` I 've Got a Secret '' ) and that he gives pep talks to his hair ( as revealed in season seven 's `` Wrong - Way Tanner '' ) . </P> <P> Jesse first moves into the house with virtually no experience in taking care of young children or babies , but starts to learn the ropes along the way .""]",3.585860252380371,0.9999999999,1.0,0.33333333333333337,0.4673356961588697,1.0

The purpose of a demo is to persuade `` name '' singers to record a song by demonstrating how it might be done . After recording Ward 's vocal at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles , Botkin thought it might sound better if her voice was higher - pitched , so he sped up the recording by wrapping splicing tape around the capstan of the machine . Botkin realized the finished recording , with bird and surf sound effects added , was good enough to release as a pop music single . But because the sped - up singing sounded younger than 21 - year - old Jackie Ward , she suggested using her daughter 's first name Robin on the record label .
