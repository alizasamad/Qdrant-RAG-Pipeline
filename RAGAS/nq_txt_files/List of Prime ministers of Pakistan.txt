The Prime Minister is vested with the responsibility of running the administration through his appointed federal cabinet , formulating national policies to ensure the safeguard of the interests of the nation and its people through the Council of Common Interests as well as making the decision to call nationwide general elections for the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan . </P> <P> Since 1947 , Pakistan has had eighteen prime ministers , aside from the appointed caretaker prime ministers who were only mandated to oversee the system until the election process was finished . In Pakistan 's parliamentary system , the Prime Minister is sworn - in by the President and usually is the Chairman or / the President of the party or coalition that has a majority in the National Assembly -- the lower house of Pakistan Parliament . </P> <P> After the Partition of India on the midnight of 14 / 15 August 1947 , Pakistan followed the British system by creating the post of Prime Minister based at the Prime Minister 's Secretariat . The then Governor - General of Pakistan , Muhammad Ali Jinnah , took advice from the Founding Fathers of the nation and appointed Liaquat Ali Khan to establish and lead his administration on 15 August 1947 . Before the presidential system in 1960 , seven prime ministers had served between 1947 until martial law in 1958 . In 1971 , the office was again revived but ceased to exist shortly . Executive powers and authority was given to the Prime Minister when the full set of the Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated in 1973 but the post was ceased from its effective operations after another martial law in 1977 . After the general elections held in 1985 , the office came to its existence . Between 1988 -- 99 , the office was held by Benazir Bhutto of the PPP and Nawaz Sharif of PML ( N ) , each holding the office for two non-consecutive terms between 1988 and 1999 : Bhutto during 1988 -- 90 and 1993 -- 96 ; and Sharif during 1990 -- 93 and 1997 -- 99 . </P> <P> The premiership of I.I. Chundrigar was the shortest in Pakistan 's history , serving only 55 days of his term . At approximately five years and four months in total , Sharif is the longest - serving Prime Minister . Sharif was re-elected for a third non-consecutive term on 5 June 2013 , which is a record in the history of Pakistan . The national politics in Pakistan was mostly dominated by the army department of the Pakistan Armed Forces throughout its history , but it is now dominated by the political parties . </P> <P> After the general elections held in 2002 , Zafarullah Khan Jamali was invited to form his administration as its Prime Minister . After the Supreme Court of Pakistan 's rulings to disqualified the Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in 2012 , the business of his administration was looked after by Pervez Ashraf until the caretaker administration was setup under Mir Hazar Khoso . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Key </Li> <Li> 2 Prime Ministers <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Caretakers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Notes </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Key ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Key for Prime Ministers ' list <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> Party Name </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Muslim League </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Awami League </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Republican Party </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> People Party </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> National Peoples Party </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Muslim League ( N ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Muslim League ( Q ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Tehreek - e-Insaf </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Independent </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Prime ministers ( edit ) </H2> <Table> List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan hide <Tr> <Th> Term Number </Th> <Th> Portrait </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Took office </Th> <Th> Left office </Th> <Th> Tenure </Th> <Th> Elections </Th> <Th_colspan="2"> Political party ( Alliance ) </Th> <Th> Note ( s ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Th> Liaquat Ali Khan </Th> <Td> 14 August 1947 </Td> <Td> 16 October 1951 ( assassinated ) </Td> <Td> 4 Years , 2 Months , 2 Days , </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Muslim League </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Following advice given by the founding father of the nation , Governor - General Muhammad Ali Jinnah appointed and invited the Finance Minister Liaquat Ali Khan to set up and run his administration in 1947 .

However Benazir Bhutto 's two non-consecutive terms ( 1988 - 1990 and 1993 - 1996 ) and Nawaz Sharif 's three non-consecutive terms ( 1990 - 1993 , 1997 - 1999 and 2013 - 2017 ) are usually counted separately . As a result some sources count Khan as 19th Prime Minister , but most count him as 22nd . This counting system does not treat Nawaz Sharif 's two periods in office in 1993 ( separated by Balakh Sher Mazari 's brief stint as caretaker ) as separate terms . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Article 153 ( 2a ) - 153 ( 2c ) in Chapter 3 : Special Provisions , Part V : Relations between Federation and Provinces in the Constitution of Pakistan . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Prime minister '' .
