Produced first by Saban Entertainment , later by BVS Entertainment , and today by SCG Power Rangers , the television series takes much of its footage from the Japanese tokusatsu Super Sentai , produced by Toei Company . The first Power Rangers entry , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , debuted on August 28 , 1993 , and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s , during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai . As of 2001 , the media franchise has generated over $6 billion in retail sales worldwide . </P> <P> Despite initial criticism that its action violence targeted child audiences , the franchise has continued , and as of 2017 the show consists of 24 television seasons of 20 different themed series and three theatrical films released in 1995 , 1997 and 2017 . In 2010 , Haim Saban , creator of the series , regained ownership of the franchise after seven years under The Walt Disney Company . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Premise </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Adapting the Super Sentai series </Li> <Li> 2.2 Broadcast history </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Television series <Ul> <Li> 3.1 The Saban Era </Li> <Li> 3.2 The Disney Era </Li> <Li> 3.3 The Neo-Saban Era </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Feature films </Li> <Li> 5 Distribution <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Home media </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Broadcast </Li> <Li> 7 Video games </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Premise </H2> Further information : List of Power Rangers characters and List of Power Rangers villains <P> Since Power Rangers derives most of its footage from the Super Sentai series , it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series . Each series revolves around a team of youths recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into the eponymous Power Rangers , able to utilize special powers and pilot immense assault machines , called Zords , to overcome the periodic antagonists . In the original series Mighty Morphin , the wizard Zordon recruits `` teenagers with attitude '' against Rita Repulsa . </P> <P> When `` morphed , '' the rangers become powerful superheroes wearing color - coded skin - tight spandex suits and helmets with opaque visors ; identical except in individual rangers ' color and helmet design . Morphed Rangers generally possess enhanced strength , durability , agility and combat prowess . Some possess superhuman or psychic abilities such as super-speed , element manipulation , extra-sensory perception or invisibility . In addition , each individual ranger has a unique weapon , as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting . When enemies grow to incredible size ( as nearly all do ) , Rangers utilize individual Zords that combine into a larger Megazord . </P> <P> Rangers teams operate in teams of five or three , with more Rangers joining the team later . Each team of Rangers , with a few exceptions , obeys a general set of conventions , outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series : Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight ( unless the enemy does so ) , nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public . The penalty for disobeying these rules , in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , is the loss of their power . </P> <P> As in Super Sentai , the color palette of each Power Rangers team changes every series . Only Red and Blue appear in every Ranger team , while a Yellow Ranger has been present in every season except Power Rangers Dino Charge . Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series . A Rangers ' color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series : civilian clothing often matches Ranger color . </P> <H2> History </H2> <H3> Adapting the Super Sentai series </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( October 2009 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Production of Power Rangers episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original Super Sentai source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards . Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage , Power Rangers programs consist of scenes featuring English - speaking actors ( either from the United States , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , or the United Kingdom ) spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot ( Zord and Megazord ) battles with English dubbing . In some series , original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the Power Rangers production . Like many of Saban Entertainment previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience , the plot , character names , and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage , though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season . </P> <P> Along with adapting the villains from the Super Sentai counterparts , most Power Rangers series also feature villains with no Sentai counterpart . Generally , the primary antagonist of a Power Rangers series ( for example , Lord Zedd , Divatox , etc . ) are not adapted from the Sentai . Exceptions to this includes Mighty Morphin , Zeo , Lightspeed Rescue and a few others which only use villains adapted from the Japanese shows . </P> <P> The series that began the franchise , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ( an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series , Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger ) , began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids block of programing that aired on the FOX network . It lasted for three seasons ( from 1993 to 1996 ) . </P> <H3> Broadcast history </H3> The Saban Entertainment run of the franchise -- beginning with Power Rangers in Space -- used this version of the Power Rangers logo ( 1998 -- 2001 ) . <P> Saban Entertainment distributed the Power Rangers series from 1993 until the end of 2001 , and Fox broadcast it until the fall of 2002 . The Walt Disney Company purchased the franchise as part of a buyout that took place in 2001 . This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming ABC Family Worldwide Inc . This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment in 2002 , from News Corporation , Fox 's parent company , and Haim Saban . The show continued to air on Fox until the company replaced its Fox Kids package with `` FoxBox '' in the United States . Since September 2002 , all Power Rangers shows had aired on various Disney - owned networks ( ABC Kids , Toon Disney and Jetix channels worldwide ) . When Wild Force ended , Disney moved production of the franchise from Los Angeles to New Zealand . This resulted in the closure of MMPR Productions and the dismissal of many members of the production . From Ninja Storm to date , Power Rangers is produced in New Zealand . ABC Family , another Disney - owned network , also used to air Power Rangers until it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31 , 2006 . On February 12 , 2009 , Toon Disney ended in the wake of Disney XD , ending cable airings of Power Rangers in certain areas of the United States . Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups declined to air most of the Power Rangers series since 2006 due to the lack of FCC - compliant educational and informational content in the programs . </P> <P> The Saban era seasons , starting with In Space , have gone under the `` Saban 's Power Rangers '' moniker , up until Time Force . Since the re-acquisition of Power Rangers by Saban in 2010 , this practice has continued once again starting with Samurai . </P> <P> Starting in 2005 , up until 2007 , during its run on Jetix , Power Rangers reruns were aired under the moniker Power Rangers Generations , showcasing select episodes from Mighty Morphin through Dino Thunder . </P> <P> An article in The New Zealand Herald published on March 7 , 2009 , identified Power Rangers RPM as the last season of the Power Rangers run . Production manager Sally Campbell stated in an interview , `` ... at this stage we will not be shooting another season . '' A September 1 , 2009 , revision to Disney A to Z : The Official Encyclopedia by Disney 's head archivist Dave Smith states that `` production of new episodes ( of Power Rangers ) ceased in 2009 '' . Production of Power Rangers ceased and the last series by BVS Entertainment , RPM , ended on December 26 , 2009 . </P> <P> On October 1 , 2009 , Bandai released a press release that Disney would re-broadcast Mighty Morphin Power Rangers starting in January 2010 on ABC Kids in lieu of a new series utilizing footage from the 2009 Super Sentai television series . A new toy line accompanied the series and appeared in stores in the later part of 2009 . ABC 's over-the air telecasts ended on August 28 , 2010 , and turned the hour back to affiliates . </P> <P> On May 12 , 2010 , Haim Saban bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million and announced plans to produce a new season of the television series . The eighteenth season , Samurai , began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7 , 2011 , with the previous episodes beginning rebroadcast on Nicktoons later that year . It was also announced that Saban plans to make a new Power Rangers movie . </P> <P> On July 2 , 2012 , it was announced that Saban Brands would launch a Saturday morning cartoon block on The CW , called Vortexx , on August 25 , 2012 , that would air Power Rangers Lost Galaxy . To commemorate the series ' 20th anniversary , Nickelodeon began airing Power Rangers Megaforce on February 2 , 2013 , featuring all of the past rangers from the series ' 20 - year history . On October 1 , 2013 , Saban Brands announced that it had extended agreements with Nickelodeon and Bandai America Incorporated through 2016 for its globally recognized Power Rangers franchise . In January 2016 , Saban and Nickelodeon extended their broadcast partnership through 2018 . </P> <P> The 90s Are All That aired Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as part of Mighty Morphin Weekend in 2013 . </P> <H2> Television series </H2> Main article : List of Power Rangers episodes Variations of Power Rangers throughout the franchise unite . <P> The first series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers through In Space followed a story arc called `` The Zordon Era '' with a gradually changing cast and characters over six years . Beginning with Lost Galaxy , although it had ties with the previous story arc , each Power Rangers series had its own self - contained storylines , independent of previous series . Crossover episodes between different series featuring rangers , villains , and other characters from past seasons also began with Lost Galaxy , with a few exceptions . </P> <H3> The Saban Era </H3> <P> The Saban Era is seasons 1 - 10 that includes Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ( 1993 - 1996 ) to Power Rangers Wild Force ( 2002 ) .

Since the 2010 acquisition by Saban Brands , international television distribution rights for Power Rangers have been managed by MarVista Entertainment . </P> <P> Broadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently from in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of ' the Super Sentai brand originating in Japan . Power Rangers was briefly banned in Malaysia for supposedly encouraging the use of drugs because it contained the word `` Morphin ' '' in its title , which could be associated with morphine . The show eventually aired without the offending word . In Japan , many Power Rangers television seasons and movies were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past Super Sentai casts , leading to the English - dubbed action sequences being `` re-dubbed '' or `` restored '' back to Japanese as well . Power Rangers Mystic Force is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in January 2014 , with the Magiranger cast voicing their counterparts . After broadcast of Power Rangers ended in South Korea with Wild Force , Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed Super Sentai series under the 파워 레인저 ( Power Ranger ) brand on JEI TV . Some seasons of Super Sentai broadcast in South Korea have similarly named titles as their American counterparts , such as Power Ranger Dino Thunder for Abaranger in 2007 and Power Ranger S.P.D. in place of Dekaranger . </P> <H3> Home media </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may only interest a specific audience .

In many series , a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons . In some cases , one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers do not ; an example is the Battlizer given to the Red Ranger of each series since Power Rangers in Space ( until Operation Overdrive ) . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Public servants ( rescue squad , police officers , etc . ) appearing as Rangers disregard this convention in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue , Power Rangers S.P.D. , Power Rangers Operation Overdrive and Power Rangers RPM . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ An original Power Ranger , the Titanium Ranger , was created especially for Lightspeed Rescue to add a sixth Power Ranger to the series . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Other color designations include metallic colors , violet , and `` Shadow '' , as well as protagonists who have powers and costumes similar to those of the Rangers but are not called `` Power Rangers '' , such as the Blue Senturion and Koragg the Knight Wolf . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ A joke highlighted this correlation in Dino Thunder when Tommy Oliver ( a former Green Ranger , White Ranger , and Red Ranger ) became the new Black Ranger ; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black - colored clothing . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Toei Company Profile Toei '' .
