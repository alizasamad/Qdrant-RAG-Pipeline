Mirroring often occurs in social situations , particularly in the company of close friends or family . The concept often affects other individuals ' notions about the individual that is exhibiting mirroring behaviors , which can lead to the individual building rapport with others . </P> <P> Mirroring is the subconscious replication of another person 's nonverbal signals . This concept takes place in everyday interactions , and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored . The activation of mirror neurons takes place within the individual who begins to mirror another 's movements , and allows them a greater connection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring , as well as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with the other individual . Mirroring is distinct from conscious imitation under the premise that while the latter is a conscious , typically overt effort to copy another person , mirroring is subconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed . </P> <P> The display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy , as babies begin to mimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body movements . The ability to mimic another person 's actions allows the infant to establish a sense of empathy and thus begin to understand another person 's emotions . The infant continues to establish connections with other individual 's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements . </P> <P> Mirroring can establish rapport with the individual who is being mirrored , as the similarities in nonverbal gestures allow the individual to feel more connected with the person exhibiting the mirrored behavior . As the two individuals in the situation display similar nonverbal gestures , they may believe that they share similar attitudes and ideas as well . Mirror neurons react to and cause these movements , allowing the individuals to feel a greater sense of engagement and belonging within the situation . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Occurrence <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Interviews </Li> <Li> 1.2 Effects of lacking </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Development <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Self - concept </Li> <Li> 2.2 Empathy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Rapport <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Power dynamics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Occurrence ( edit ) </H2> Mirroring taking place during a meeting with President Reagan . <P> Mirroring generally takes place subconsciously as individuals react with the situation . Mirroring is common in conversation , as the listeners will typically smile or frown along with the speaker , as well as imitate body posture or attitude about the topic . Individuals may be more willing to empathize with and accept people whom they believe hold similar interests and beliefs , and thus mirroring the person with whom one is speaking may establish connections between the individuals involved . </P> <H3> Interviews ( edit ) </H3> <P> Additionally , mirroring may play a role in how well an individual fares in a job interview . Within a study conducted by Word , Zanna and Cooper , interviewers were instructed to follow specific types of body language in different experimental conditions . In one condition , interviewers were instructed to demonstrate distant and uninterested body language ( such as leaning away or avoiding eye contact ) , and in another condition they were asked to demonstrate more welcoming body language ( such as smiling and making eye contact ) . As a result , the individuals being interviewed began to mirror the actions of the interviewer , and thus the individuals in the condition with less friendly body language fared worse within the interview than did individuals in the friendly condition . The study demonstrates that the initial attitudes that an interviewer may have of the individual being interviewed may affect the performance of the interviewee due to mirroring . </P> <H3> Effects of lacking ( edit ) </H3> <P> Individuals with autism or other social difficulties may be less likely to exhibit mirroring , as they may be less subconsciously and consciously aware of the actions of others . This factor may cause additional difficulties for the individuals , as without mirroring , establishing connections with other people may be more difficult . Additionally , other individuals may be less likely to build rapport with the person , as without mirroring the person may seem more dissimilar and less friendly . Individuals who are not subconsciously aware of gesture may have difficulties in social situations , as they may be less able to understand another person 's perspective without it being explicitly stated , and thus may not understand covert cues that are often used in the social world . It is possible , though very rare , for some of these individuals to deliberately learn and become aware of these cues . This , however , is the exception to the rule , not the norm . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> A young boy mirrors the gesture of his grandmother . <P> In infant - parent interactions , mirroring consists of the parent imitating the infant 's expressions while vocalizing the emotion implied by the expression . This imitation helps the infant to associate the emotion with their expression , as well as feel validated in their own emotions as the parent shows approval through imitation . Studies have demonstrated that mirroring is an important part of child and infant development . According to Kohut 's theories of self - psychology , individuals need a sense of validation and belonging in order to establish their concepts of self . When parents mirror their infants , the action may help the child develop a greater sense of self - awareness and self - control , as they can see their emotions within their parent 's faces . Additionally , infants may learn and experience new emotions , facial expressions , and gestures by mirroring expressions that their parents utilize . The process of mirroring may help infants establish connections of expressions to emotions and thus promote social communication later in life . Infants also learn to feel secure and valid in their own emotions through mirroring , as the parent 's imitation of their emotions may help the child recognize their own thoughts and feelings more readily . </P> <H3> Self - concept ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Self - concept <P> Mirroring has been shown to play a critical role in the development of an infant 's notion of self . The importance of mirroring suggests that infants primarily gather their social skills from their parents , and thus a household that lacks mirroring may inhibit the child 's social development . Without mirroring , it may be difficult for the child to relate their emotions to socially learned expressions and thus have a difficult experience in expressing their own emotions . </P> <H3> Empathy ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Empathy <P> The inability to properly mirror other individuals may strain the child 's social relationships later in life . This strain may exist because others may feel more distant from the child due to a lack of rapport , or because the child may have a difficult time feeling empathy for others without mirroring . Mirroring helps to facilitate empathy , as individuals more readily experience other people 's emotions through mimicking posture and gestures . This empathy may help individuals create lasting relationships and thus excel in social situations . The action of mirroring allows individuals to believe they are more similar to another person , and perceived similarity can be the basis for creating a relationship . </P> <H2> Rapport ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Rapport <P> Rapport may be an important part of social life , as establishing rapport with an individual is generally the initial route to becoming friends or acquaintances with another person . Mirroring can help establish rapport , as exhibiting similar actions , attitudes , and speech patterns as another person may lead them to believe that one is more similar to them and thus more likely to be a friend . Individuals may believe that because one replicates the individual 's gestures , that one may hold similar beliefs and attitudes as the individual . Mirroring may be more pervasive in close friendships or romantic relationships , as the individuals regard each other highly and thus wish to emulate or appease them . Additionally , individuals who are friends may have more similarities than two strangers , and thus may be more likely to exhibit similar body language regardless of mirroring . </P> <H3> Power dynamics ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Power ( social and political ) <P> Additionally , individuals are likely to mirror the person of higher status or power within the situation . Mirroring individuals of higher power may create an illusion of higher status , or create rapport with the individual in power , thus allowing the person to gain favor with the individual in power . This mechanism may be helpful for individuals in situations where they are in a position of bargaining with an individual who possesses more power , as the rapport that mirroring creates may help to persuade the higher status individual to help the person of lower status . These situations include job interviews , other work situations such as requesting promotions , parent - child interactions , and asking professors for favors . Each of these situations involve one party who is in a more powerless position for bargaining , and another party who has the ability to fulfill the person of lower status 's needs , but may not necessarily wish to . Thus , mirroring can be a useful tool for individuals of lower status in order to persuade the other party to relinquish goods or privileges for the lower status party . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Eye contact </Li> <Li> Facial expression </Li> <Li> Gesture </Li> <Li> Kinesthetic learning </Li> <Li> Nonverbal communication </Li> <Li> Mirror stage </Li> <Li> Mirror neuron </Li> <Li> Posture </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Chartrand , T. ; Bargh , J. `` The Chameleon Effect : The Perception - Behavior Link and Social Interaction '' ( PDF ) . yale.edu .
