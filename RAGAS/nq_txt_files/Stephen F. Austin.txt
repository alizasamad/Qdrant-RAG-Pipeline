Known as the `` Father of Texas '' , and the founder of Texas , he led the second , and ultimately , the successful colonization of the region by bringing 300 families from the United States to the region in 1825 . </P> <P> Born in Virginia and raised in southeastern Missouri , Austin served in the Missouri territorial legislature before moving to Arkansas Territory and later Louisiana . His father , Moses Austin , received an empresario grant from Spain to settle Texas . After Moses Austin 's death in 1821 , Stephen Austin won recognition of the empresario grant from the newly - independent state of Mexico . Austin convinced numerous American settlers to move to Texas , and by 1825 Austin had brought the first 300 American families into the territory . Throughout the 1820s , Austin sought to maintain good relations with the Mexican government , and he helped suppress the Fredonian Rebellion . He also helped ensure the introduction of slavery into Texas despite the attempts of the Mexican government to ban the institution . </P> <P> As Texas settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with the Mexican government , Austin advocated conciliation with the Mexican government , but the dissent against Mexico escalated into the Texas Revolution . Austin led Texas forces at the successful Siege of Béxar before serving as a commissioner to the United States . Austin ran in the 1836 Texas presidential election but was defeated by Sam Houston . Houston appointed Austin as secretary of state for the new republic , and Austin held that position until his death in December 1836 . </P> <P> Numerous places and institutions are named in his honor , including the capital of Texas , Austin in Travis County , Austin County , Austin Bayou , Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches , Austin College in Sherman , and a number of K - 12 schools . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early years </Li> <Li> 2 Moving to Texas </Li> <Li> 3 Empresario Austin </Li> <Li> 4 Slavery </Li> <Li> 5 Relations with Mexico </Li> <Li> 6 Texas Revolution </Li> <Li> 7 Austin in the Republic of Texas </Li> <Li> 8 Death and estate </Li> <Li> 9 Monuments </Li> <Li> 10 Past family </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 Further reading </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early years </H2> Coat of arms of Stephen F. Austin Memorial to Stephen F. Austin in his birthplace <P> Stephen F. Austin was born in the mining region of southwestern Virginia ( Wythe County ) in what is known as Austinville today , some 256 miles ( 412 km ) southwest of Richmond , Virginia . He was the second child of Mary Brown Austin and Moses Austin ; the first , Eliza , lived only one month . On June 8 , 1798 , when Stephen was four years old , his family moved west to the lead - mining region of present - day Potosi , Missouri , 40 miles west of the Mississippi River . His father Moses Austin received a sitio from the Spanish government for the mining site of Mine à Breton , established by French colonists . His great - great - grandfather , Anthony Austin ( b. 1636 ) , was the son of Richard Austin ( b. 1598 in Bishopstoke , Hampshire , England ) , he and his wife Esther were original settlers of Suffield , Massachusetts , which became Connecticut in 1749 . </P> <P> When Austin was eleven years old , his family sent him back east to be educated , first at the preparatory school of Bacon Academy in Colchester , Connecticut , and then at Transylvania University in Lexington , Kentucky , from which he graduated in 1810 . After graduation , Austin began studying to be a lawyer . At age 21 , he served in the legislature of the Missouri Territory . As a member of the territorial legislature , he was `` influential in obtaining a charter for the struggling Bank of St. Louis . '' </P> <P> Left penniless after the Panic of 1819 , Austin decided to move south to the new Arkansas Territory . He acquired property on the south bank of the Arkansas River , in the area that would later become Little Rock . After purchasing the property , he learned the area was being considered as the location for the new territorial capital , which could make his land worth a great deal more . He made his home in Hempstead County , Arkansas . Two weeks before the first Arkansas territorial elections in 1820 , Austin declared his candidacy for Congress . His late entrance meant his name did not appear on the ballot in two of the five counties , but he still placed second in the field of six candidates . Later , he was appointed as a judge for the First Circuit Court . Over the next few months , Little Rock did become the territorial capital , but Austin 's claim to land in the area was contested , and the courts ruled against him . The Territorial Assembly reorganized the government and abolished Austin 's judgeship . </P> <P> Austin left the territory , moving to Louisiana . He reached New Orleans in November 1820 , where he met and stayed with a New Orleans lawyer and former Kentucky congressman , Joseph H. Hawkins , and made arrangements to study law . </P> <H2> Moving to Texas </H2> Sam Houston and Stephen Austin depicted on the Texas Centennial Issue postage stamp of 1936 <P> During Austin 's time in Arkansas , his father traveled to Spanish Texas and received an empresarial grant that would allow him to bring 300 American families to Texas , they would be called `` The Old 300 . '' Moses Austin caught pneumonia soon after returning to Missouri . He directed that his empresario grant would be taken over by his son Stephen . </P> <P> Although Austin was reluctant to carry on his father 's Texas venture , he was persuaded to pursue the colonization of Texas by a letter from his mother , Mary Brown Austin , written two days before Moses Austin would die . Austin boarded the steamer , Beaver , and departed to New Orleans to meet Spanish officials led by Erasmo Seguín . He was at Natchitoches , Louisiana , on June 31 , 1821 , when he learned of his father 's death . `` This news has effected me very much , he was one of the most feeling and affectionate Fathers that ever lived . His faults I now say , and always have , were not of the heart . '' </P> <P> At the age of 24 , Austin led his party to travel 300 miles ( 480 km ) in four weeks to San Antonio with the intent of reauthorizing his father 's grant , arriving on August 12 . While in transit , they learned Mexico had declared its independence from Spain , and Texas had become a Mexican province , rather than a Spanish territory . José Antonio Navarro , a San Antonio native with ambitious visions of the future of Texas , befriended Stephen F. Austin , and the two developed a lasting association . Navarro , proficient in Spanish and Mexican law , assisted Austin in obtaining his empresario contracts . In San Antonio , the grant was reauthorized by Governor Antonio María Martínez , who allowed Austin to explore the Gulf Coast between San Antonio and the Brazos River to find a suitable location for a colony . As guides for the party , Manuel Becerra and three Aranama Indians , went with the expedition . </P> <P> Austin advertised the Texas opportunity in New Orleans , announcing that land was available along the Brazos and Colorado rivers . A family of a husband , wife , and two children would receive 1,280 acres ( 520 ha ) at twelve and a half cents per acre . Farmers could get 177 acres ( 72 ha ) , and ranchers 4,428 acres ( 1,792 ha ) . In December 1821 , the first U.S. colonists crossed into the granted territory by land and sea , on the Brazos River in present - day Brazoria County , Texas . </P> <H2> Empresario Austin </H2> Stephen F. Austin was an important figure in early Texas <P> Austin 's plan for an American colony was thrown into turmoil by Mexico 's gaining independence from Spain in 1821 . Governor Martínez informed Austin that the junta instituyente , the new rump congress of the government of Agustín de Iturbide of Mexico , refused to recognize the land grant authorized by Spain . His government intended to use a general immigration law to regulate new settlement in Mexico . Austin traveled to Mexico City , where he persuaded the junta instituyente to approve the grant to his father , as well as the law signed by the Mexican Emperor on January 3 , 1823 . </P> <P> The old imperial law offered heads of families a league and a labor of land , 4,605 acres ( 1,864 ha ) , and other inducements . It also provided for the employment of agents , called empresarios , to promote immigration . As an empresario , Austin was to receive 67,000 acres of land for each 200 families he brought to Texas . According to the law , immigrants were not required to pay fees to the government . Some of the immigrants denied Austin 's right to charge them for services at the rate of 12.5 cents / acre ( 31 cents / ha ) . </P> <P> When the Emperor of Mexico , Agustín de Iturbide , abdicated in March 1823 , the law was annulled once again . In April 1823 , Austin induced the congress to grant him a contract to bring 300 families into Texas . He wanted honest , hard - working people who would make the colony a success . In 1824 , the congress passed a new immigration law that allowed the individual states of Mexico to administer public lands and open them to settlement under certain conditions . In March 1825 , the legislature of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas passed a law similar to the one authorized by Iturbide . The law continued the system of empresarios , as well as granting each married man a league of land , 4,428 acres ( 1,792 ha ) , with the stipulation that he must pay the state $30 within six years . </P> <P> By late 1825 , Austin had brought the first 300 families to his settlement , the Austin Colony ; these 300 are now known in Texas history as the Old Three Hundred . Austin had obtained further contracts to settle an additional 900 families between 1825 and 1829 . He had effective civil and military authority over the settlers , but he was quick to introduce a semblance of American law - the Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas was agreed on in November 1827 . Also , Austin organized small , informal armed groups to protect the colonists , which evolved into the Texas Rangers . Despite his hopes , Austin was making little money from his endeavors ; the colonists were unwilling to pay for his services as empresario and most of his revenues were spent on the processes of government and other public services . </P> <P> During these years , Austin , a member of Louisiana Lodge No. 111 at Ste . Genevieve , Missouri , sought to establish Freemasonry in Texas . Freemasonry was well established among the educated classes of Mexican society . It had been introduced among the aristocracy loyal to the House of Bourbon , and the conservatives had total control over the Order . By 1827 , Americans living in Mexico City had introduced the United States York Rite of Freemasonry as a liberal alternative to the established European - style Scottish Rite . </P> <P> On February 11 , 1828 , Austin called a meeting of Freemasons at San Felipe to elect officers and to petition the Masonic Grand Lodge in Mexico City for a charter to form a lodge . Austin was elected Worshipful Master of the new lodge . Although the petition reached Matamoros , and was to be forwarded to Mexico City , nothing more was heard of it . By 1828 , the ruling faction in Mexico was afraid the liberal elements in Texas might try to gain their independence . Fully aware of the political philosophies of American Freemasons , the Mexican government outlawed Freemasonry on October 25 , 1828 . In 1829 , Austin called another meeting , where it was decided that it was `` impolitic and imprudent , at this time , to form Masonic lodges in Texas . '' </P> <P> He was active in promoting trade and currying the good favor of the Mexican authorities , aiding them in the suppression of the Fredonian Rebellion of Haden Edwards . Some historians consider the Fredonian Rebellion to be the beginning of the Texas Revolution . Although `` premature ... the Fredonian Rebellion sparked the powder for later success . '' For this event , Austin raised troops to fight with Mexican troops against the Texas rebels . With the colonists numbering more than 11,000 by 1832 , they were becoming less amenable to Austin 's cautious leadership , and also , the Mexican government was becoming less cooperative . It was concerned with the growth of the colony and the efforts of the U.S. government to buy the state from them . The Mexican government had attempted to stop further U.S. immigration as early as April 1830 , but Austin 's skills gained an exemption for his colonies . He granted land to immigrants based on 640 acres ( 2.6 km ) to the husband , 320 to the wife , 160 for every child , and 80 for every slave . </P> <H2> Slavery </H2> <P> Slavery was a very important issue to Austin , one he called `` of great interest '' to him . Austin was a periodical slaveowner throughout his life ; however , he had conflicting views about it . Theoretically , he believed slavery was wrong and went against the American ideal of liberty . In practice , however , he agreed with the social , economic , and political justifications of it , and worked hard to defend and expand it . Despite his defense of it , he also harbored concerns that the long - term effects of slavery would destroy American society . He grew particularly concerned following Nat Turner 's rebellion , stating : </P> <P> `` I sometimes shudder at the consequences and think that a large part of America will be Santo Domingonized in 100 , or 200 years . The idea of seeing such a country as this overrun by a slave population almost makes me weep . It is in vain to tell a North American that the white population will be destroyed some fifty or eighty years hence by the negroes , and that his daughters will be violated and Butchered by them . '' </P> <P> While Austin thought it would be advantageous some day for Texas to phase out of slavery , up until the Texas Revolution , he worked to ensure that his colony 's immigrants could bypass the Mexican government 's resistance to it . Doing so ensured the population growth and economic development of his colony , which was primarily dependent on the monocropping of cotton and sugar . </P> <P> Arguing that the loss of slaves would be ruinous to the colony , he arranged for his settlers to receive eighty acres of land for each slave they brought with them to Texas . In August 1825 , he recommended that the state government allow immigrants to bring their slaves with them through 1840 , with the caveat that female grandchildren of the slaves would be freed by the age of 15 , and males by age of 25 . His recommendation was rejected . </P> <P> In 1826 , when a state committee proposed abolishing slavery outright , 25 percent of the people in Austin 's colony were slaves . Austin 's colonists , mostly pro-slavery immigrants from the south , threatened to leave Texas if the proposition passed , while prospective Southern immigrants hesitated to come to Texas until slavery was guaranteed there . </P> <P> Austin conceded that the success of his colony was dependent on slavery . Without slaves , the colonists would lack the mass labor to cultivate the land , which would stall the pace of immigration needed to develop and increase the value of the land , which would deflate the economy and motivate his colonists to leave . </P> <P> Austin went before the legislature and pleaded that , at the least ; his original 300 colonists should be allowed to keep their slaves . He argued against the `` bad faith '' of freeing them , demanded reparations to slaveowners for every slave emancipated by the state , warned that the loss of slaves could leave some colonists destitute , and reasoned that freeing them would not only leave his settlers alone in the harsh Texas environment , but would also expose them to the discomfort and nuisance of living amongst freed slaves , who would become vagrants seeking retribution upon their former owners . While he waited for the legislature 's verdict of his request , Austin went into a deep depression over the issue and sent his brother , Brown Austin , to further lobby the legislature on his behalf . </P> <P> In March of 1827 , the legislature signed Article 13 into law . Despite the law complying with some of his requests , Austin called it `` unconstitutional . '' He contested the law as it freed the children of slaves at birth , established a six - month grace period before fully emancipating all slaves in the state , and included provisions to improve the conditions of slaves and transitioning freedmen . Austin -- -- who had been so effective in persuading the legislature , however , that the author of Article 13 ( before its passage ) requested to withdraw it -- -- helped his colonists evade the law by advising them to legally supplant the word `` slave '' with the words `` workingmen , '' `` family servants , '' and `` laborers , '' and by working to pass a decree that banned freedmen from Texas and forced emancipated slaves to work for their former slaveowners until the accrued `` debt '' ( e.g. clothing , food ) , incurred for their own enslavement , was worked off . </P> <P> In 1828 , Austin petitioned the legislature to guarantee that slaveowners , immigrating to Texas , could legally `` free '' their slaves before immigrating , and contract them into a lifetime term of indentured servitude , thereby avoiding recognizing them as slaves . He lobbied to help his colony elude Vicente Guerrero 's 1829 attempt to legally emancipate slaves in the province , and to bypass the government 's effort to prohibit slavery when it passed the Law of April 6 , 1830 . In 1830 , Austin wrote that he would oppose Texas joining the United States without guarantees that he should `` insist on the perpetual exclusion of slavery from this state ( Texas ) . '' In 1833 , he wrote : </P> <P> `` Texas must be a slave country . Circumstances and unavoidable necessity compel it . It is the wish of the people there , and it is my duty to do all I can , prudently , in favor of it . I will do so . '' </P> <P> In May 1835 , Austin 's colonists learned that Mexico 's tolerance for the evasions of slaveowners was drawing to a close , with its proposal of new abolition legislation . Alarmed , and with Austin imprisoned in Mexico for pushing for independence , colonists turned against the Mexican government , calling it `` oppressive '' and a `` plundering , robbing , autocratical government '' without regard for the security of `` life , liberty or property . '' Resisting the impact a changed slavery policy would have on economic growth , and fearing rumors of Mexico 's plan to free the slaves and turn them loose upon the colonists , shortly after Austin returned from Mexico , he and his colonists took up arms against the Mexican government . Austin later gained U.S. Government support for his revolution when he wrote to Senator Lewis F. Linn and pleaded that Santa Anna planned to `` exterminate '' all of the colonists and fill Texas `` with Indians and negroes ( freed slaves ) . '' </P> <H2> Relations with Mexico </H2> Marble sculpture of Stephen F. Austin ( 1903 ) by Elisabet Ney at the Texas State Capitol <P> The application off the immigration control of the introduction of tariff laws had done much to dissatisfy the colonists , peaking in the Anahuac Disturbances . Austin became involved in Mexican politics , supporting the upstart Antonio López de Santa Anna . Following the success of Santa Anna , the colonists sought a compensatory reward , proclaimed at the Convention of 1832 -- resumption of immigration , tariff exemption , separation from Coahuila , and a new state government for Texas . Austin did not support these demands ; he considered them ill - timed and tried his hardest to moderate them . When they were repeated and extended at the Convention of 1833 , Austin traveled to Mexico City on July 18 , 1833 , and met with Vice President Valentín Gomez Farías . Austin did gain certain important reforms ; the immigration ban was lifted , but a separate state government was not authorized . Statehood in Mexico required a population of 80,000 , and Texas had only 30,000 . </P> <P> Believing that he was pushing for Texas independence and suspect that he was trying to incite insurrection , Austin was arrested by the Mexican government in January 1834 in Saltillo , Coahuila , Mexico . He was taken to Mexico City and imprisoned . No charges were filed against him as no court would take jurisdiction . He was moved from prison to prison . He was released under bond in December 1834 and required to stay in the Federal District . He was fully freed under the general amnesty in July 1835 and in August 1835 left Mexico to return to Texas via New Orleans . </P> <H2> Texas Revolution </H2> Main article : Texas Revolution <P> In his absence , a number of events propelled the colonists toward confrontation with Santa Anna 's centralist government . Austin took temporary command of the Texan forces during the Siege of Béxar from October 12 to December 11 , 1835 . After learning of the Disturbances at Anahuac and Velasco in the summer of 1835 , an enraged Santa Anna made rapid preparations for the Mexican army to sweep Anglo settlers from Texas . War began in October 1835 at Gonzales . The Republic of Texas , created by a new constitution on March 2 , 1836 , won independence following a string of defeats with the dramatic turnabout victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21 , 1836 , and the capture of Santa Anna the following morning . He was then imprisoned . </P> <H2> Austin in the republic of Texas </H2> Further information : Republic of Texas <P> In December 1835 , Austin , Branch Archer , and William H. Wharton were appointed commissioners to the U.S. by the provisional government of the republic . On June 10 , 1836 , Austin was in New Orleans , where he received word of Santa Anna 's defeat by Sam Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto . Austin returned to Texas to rest at Peach Point in August . On August 4 , he announced his candidacy for president of Texas . Austin felt confident he could win the election until two weeks before the election , when on August 20 , Houston entered the race . Austin wrote , `` Many of the old settlers who are too blind to see or understand their interest will vote for him . '' Houston carried East Texas , the Red River region , and most of the soldiers ' votes . Austin received 587 votes to Sam Houston 's 5,119 and Henry Smith 's 743 votes . </P> <P> Houston would appoint Austin as the first secretary of state of the new republic ; however , Austin only served approximately two months before his death . </P> <H2> Death and estate </H2> <P> In December 1836 , Austin was in the new capital of Columbia ( now known as West Columbia ) where he caught a severe cold ; his condition worsened . Doctors were called in , but could not help him . Austin died of pneumonia at noon on December 27 , 1836 . He was at the home of George B. McKinstry , near what is now West Columbia , Texas . He was 43 . Austin 's last words were `` The independence of Texas is recognized ! Do n't you see it in the papers ? ... '' Upon hearing of Austin 's death , Houston ordered an official statement proclaiming : `` The Father of Texas is no more ; the first pioneer of the wilderness has departed . '' Originally , Austin was buried at Gulf Prairie Cemetery in Brazoria County , Texas . In 1910 Austin 's body was reinterred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin . </P> <P> Austin never married , nor did he have any children . He bequeathed all his land , titles , and possessions , to his married sister , Emily Austin Perry . </P> <H2> Monuments </H2> Stephen F. Austin State Office Building Stephen F.

In the story line , the hardy , cantankerous pioneer James Briton `` Brit '' Bailey ( Paul Fix ) and his wife , Hannah ( Rosemary DeCamp ) , make their final settlement in southeastern Texas after having overcome many obstacles over the years . Now they face Austin 's order that they leave their land , however , Austin has a change of heart and asks them to stay .
