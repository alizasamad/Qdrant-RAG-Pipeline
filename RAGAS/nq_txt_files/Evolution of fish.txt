It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column , leading to the first craniates and vertebrates . The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha , or jawless fish . Early examples include Haikouichthys . During the late Cambrian , eel - like jawless fish called the conodonts , and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms , first appeared . Most jawless fish are now extinct ; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish . Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata , which includes the extant hagfish , and this group may have split early on from other agnathans . </P> <P> The first jawed vertebrates probably developed during the late Ordovician period . They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish : the armoured fish known as placoderms , which evolved from the ostracoderms ; and the Acanthodii ( or spiny sharks ) . The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian : the Chondrichthyes ( or cartilaginous fish ) and the Osteichthyes ( or bony fish ) . The bony fish evolved into two separate groups : the Actinopterygii ( or ray - finned fish ) and Sarcopterygii ( which includes the lobe - finned fish ) . </P> <P> During the Devonian period a great increase in fish variety occurred , especially that of the ostracoderms and placoderms , as well as lobe - finned fish and early sharks . This has led to the Devonian being known as the age of fishes . It was from the lobe - finned fish that the tetrapods evolved , the four - limbed vertebrates , represented today by amphibians , mammals , reptiles and birds . Transitional tetrapods first appeared during the early Devonian , and by the late Devonian the first tetrapods appeared . The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth ; but it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force , improved respiration , or a combination of factors . Fish do not represent a monophyletic group , but a paraphyletic one , as they exclude the tetrapods . </P> <P> Fish , like many other organisms , have been greatly affected by extinction events throughout natural history . The Ordovician -- Silurian extinction events led to the loss of many species . The late Devonian extinction led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian , as well as other fish . The spiny sharks became extinct at the Permian -- Triassic extinction event ; the conodonts became extinct at the Triassic -- Jurassic extinction event . The Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , and the present day Holocene extinction , have also affected fish variety and fish stocks . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Overview </Li> <Li> 2 Jawless fish <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Conodonts </Li> <Li> 2.2 Ostracoderms </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Jawed fish <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Placoderms </Li> <Li> 3.2 Spiny sharks </Li> <Li> 3.3 Cartilaginous fishes </Li> <Li> 3.4 Bony fishes <Ul> <Li> 3.4. 1 Lobe - finned fishes </Li> <Li> 3.4. 2 Ray - finned fishes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Timeline <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Pre Devonian : Origin of fish </Li> <Li> 4.2 Devonian : Age of fishes </Li> <Li> 4.3 Fish to tetrapods </Li> <Li> 4.4 Post Devonian </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Prehistoric fish </Li> <Li> 6 Living fossils </Li> <Li> 7 Fossil sites </Li> <Li> 8 Fossil collections </Li> <Li> 9 Paleoichthyologists </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Citations </Li> <Li> 11.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Overview ( edit ) </H2> Vertebrate classes Spindle diagram for the evolution of fish and other vertebrate classes . The diagram is based on Michael Benton , 2005 . <P> Conventional classification has living vertebrates as a subphylum grouped into eight classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits . In turn , these classes are grouped into the vertebrates that have four limbs ( the tetrapods ) and those that do not : fishes . The extant vertebrate classes are : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Fish : <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> jawless fishes ( Agnatha ) </Li> <Li> cartilaginous fishes ( Chondrichthyes ) </Li> <Li> ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) </Li> <Li> lobe - finned fishes ( Sarcopterygii ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> <Dd> Tetrapods : <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> amphibians ( Amphibia ) </Li> <Li> reptiles ( Reptilia ) </Li> <Li> birds ( Aves ) </Li> <Li> mammals ( Mammalia ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> In addition to these are two classes of extinct jawed fishes , the armoured placoderms and the spiny sharks . Further information : Vertebrate paleontology and List of transitional fossils § Invertebrates to Fish <P> Fish may have evolved from an animal similar to a coral - like sea squirt ( a tunicate ) , whose larvae resemble early fish in important ways . The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood ( as some sea squirts do today ) , although this path can not be proven . </P> <P> Vertebrates , among them the first fishes , originated about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion , which saw the rise in organism diversity . </P> The lancelet , a small , translucent , fish - like animal , is the closest living invertebrate relative of the olfactoreans ( vertebrates and tunicates ) . The early vertebrate Haikouichthys , from about 518 million years ago in China , may be the `` ancestor to all vertebrates '' and is one of the earliest known fish . Somewhat dated view of continuous evolutionary gradation ( click to animate ) <P> The first ancestors of fish , or animals that were probably closely related to fish , were Pikaia , Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia . These three genera all appeared around 530 Ma . Pikaia had a primitive notochord , a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later . Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian , these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan : a notochord , rudimentary vertebrae , and a well - defined head and tail . All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed . </P> <P> These were followed by indisputable fossil vertebrates in the form of heavily armoured fishes discovered in rocks from the Ordovician Period 500 -- 430 Ma . </P> <P> The first jawed vertebrates appeared in the late Ordovician and became common in the Devonian , often known as the `` Age of Fishes '' . The two groups of bony fishes , the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii , evolved and became common . The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes , save for lampreys and hagfish , as well as the Placodermi , a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late Silurian . The Devonian also saw the rise of the first labyrinthodonts , which was a transitional between fishes and amphibians . </P> <P> The colonisation of new niches resulted in diversification of body plans and sometimes an increase in size . The Devonian Period ( 395 to 345 Ma ) brought in such giants as the placoderm Dunkleosteus , which could grow up to seven meters long , and early air - breathing fish that could remain on land for extended periods . Among this latter group were ancestral amphibians . </P> <P> The reptiles appeared from labyrinthodonts in the subsequent Carboniferous period . The anapsid and synapsid reptiles were common during the late Paleozoic , while the diapsids became dominant during the Mesozoic . In the sea , the bony fishes became dominant . </P> <P> The later radiations , such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods , involved fewer taxa , mainly with very similar body plans . The first animals to venture onto dry land were arthropods . Some fish had lungs and strong , bony fins and could crawl onto the land also . </P> <H2> Jawless fish ( edit ) </H2> A modern jawless fish , the lamprey , attached to a modern jawed fish Lamprey mouth Main article : Agnatha <P> Jawless fishes belong to the superclass Agnatha in the phylum Chordata , subphylum Vertebrata . Agnatha comes from the Greek , and means `` no jaws '' . It excludes all vertebrates with jaws , known as gnathostomes . Although a minor element of modern marine fauna , jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic . Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins , vertebrate musculature , and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China : Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia . They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier . A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella . A possible agnathid that has not been formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia . </P> <P> Many Ordovician , Silurian , and Devonian agnathians were armoured with heavy bony - spiky plates . The first armoured agnathans -- the Ostracoderms , precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods ( including humans ) -- are known from the middle Ordovician , and by the Late Silurian the agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution . Most of the ostracoderms , such as thelodonts , osteostracans , and galeaspids , were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans , known as cyclostomes . Cyclostomes apparently split from other agnathans before the evolution of dentine and bone , which are present in many fossil agnathans , including conodonts . Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered . </P> <P> The agnathans as a whole are paraphyletic , because most extinct agnathans belong to the stem group of gnathostomes . Recent molecular data , both from rRNA and from mtDNA strongly supports the theory that living agnathans , known as cyclostomes , are monophyletic . In phylogenetic taxonomy , the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks , but illustrated as a nested `` family tree '' known as a cladogram . Phylogenetic groups are given definitions based on their relationship to one another , rather than purely on physical traits such as the presence of a backbone . This nesting pattern is often combined with traditional taxonomy , in a practice known as evolutionary taxonomy . </P> Evolution of jawless fishes . The diagram is based on Michael Benton , 2005 . <P> The cladogram below for jawless fish is based on studies compiled by Philippe Janvier and others for the Tree of Life Web Project .

They appeared 495 Ma and were wiped out 200 Ma . Initially they were known only from tooth - like microfossils called conodont elements . These `` teeth '' have been variously interpreted as filter - feeding apparatuses or as a `` grasping and crushing array '' . Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40 cm Promissum . Their large eyes had a lateral position , which makes a predatory role unlikely . The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts ( Promissum at least ) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed . In 2012 researchers classified the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays , chevron - shaped muscles and notochord . Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys , though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups . </P> <H3> Ostracoderms ( edit ) </H3> Ostracoderms ( extinct ) were armoured jawless fishes <P> Ostracoderms ( shell - skinned ) are armoured jawless fishes of the Paleozoic . The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is paraphyletic or polyphyletic , and has no phylogenetic meaning . However , the term is still used informally to group together the armoured jawless fishes . </P> <P> The ostracoderm armour consisted of 3 -- 5 mm polygonal plates that shielded the head and gills , and then overlapped further down the body like scales . The eyes were particularly shielded . Earlier chordates used their gills for both respiration and feeding , whereas ostracoderms used their gills for respiration only . They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head , which were permanently open with no protective operculum . Unlike invertebrates that use ciliated motion to move food , ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving prey into their mouths . </P> <P> The first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms . The Swiss anatomist Louis Agassiz received some fossils of bony armored fish from Scotland in the 1830s . He had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature . He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as catfish and sturgeons but later realizing that they had no movable jaws , classified them in 1844 into a new group `` ostracoderms '' . </P> <P> Ostracoderms existed in two major groups , the more primitive heterostracans and the cephalaspids . Later , about 420 million years ago , the jawed fish evolved from one of the ostracoderms . After the appearance of jawed fish , most ostracoderm species underwent a decline , and the last ostracoderms became extinct at the end of the Devonian period . </P> <H2> Jawed fish ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article includes a list of references , but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations .

The two most anterior pharyngeal arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch , respectively . The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull , permitting great mobility of the jaws . Already long assumed to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to more derived gnathostomes , the discovery of Entelognathus suggests that placoderms are directly ancestral to modern bony fish . </P> <P> As in most vertebrates , fish jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically , comprising an upper jaw and a lower jaw . The jaw is derived from the most anterior two pharyngeal arches supporting the gills , and usually bears numerous teeth . The skull of the last common ancestor of today 's jawed vertebrates is assumed to have resembled sharks . </P> <P> It is thought that the original selective advantage garnered by the jaw was not related to feeding , but to increased respiration efficiency . The jaws were used in the buccal pump ( observable in modern fish and amphibians ) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians . Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws ( to humans ) , in feeding , was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates . Many teleost fish have substantially modified their jaws for suction feeding and jaw protrusion , resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved . </P> <P> Jawed vertebrates and jawed fish evolved from earlier jawless fish , and the cladogram below for jawed vertebrates is a continuation of the cladogram in the section above .

The diagram is based on Michael Benton , 2005 . Placoderms ( extinct ) were armoured jawed fishes ( compare with the ostracoderms above ) Further information : Placodermi and List of placoderms <P> Placoderms , class Placodermi ( plate skinned ) , are extinct armoured prehistoric fish , which appeared about 430 Ma in the Early to Middle Silurian . They were mostly wiped out during the Late Devonian Extinction event , 378 Ma , though some survived and made a slight recovery in diversity during the Famennian epoch before dying out entirely at the close of the Devonian , 360 mya ; they are ultimately ancestal to modern vertebrates . Their head and thorax were covered with massive and often ornamented armoured plates . The rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species . The armour shield was articulated , with the head armour hinged to the thoratic armour . This allowed placoderms to lift their heads , unlike ostracoderms . Placoderms were the first jawed fish ; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches . The chart on the right shows the rise and demise of the separate placoderm lineages : Acanthothoraci , Rhenanida , Antiarchi , Petalichthyidae , Ptyctodontida and Arthrodira . </P> <H3> Spiny sharks ( edit ) </H3> Spiny sharks ( extinct ) were the earliest known jawed fishes . They resembled sharks and were indeed ancestral to them . Further information : Acanthodii and List of acanthodians <P> Spiny sharks , class Acanthodii , are extinct fishes that share features with both bony and cartilaginous fishes , though ultimately more closely related to and ancestral to the latter . Despite being called `` spiny sharks '' , acanthodians predate sharks , though they gave rise to them . They evolved in the sea at the beginning of the Silurian Period , some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared . Eventually competition from bony fishes proved too much , and the spiny sharks died out in Permian times about 250 Ma . In form they resembled sharks , but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans ( gars , bowfins ) . </P> <H3> Cartilaginous fishes ( edit ) </H3> Radiation of cartilaginous fishes , derived from work by Michael Benton , 2005 . Further information : List of transitional fossils § Chondrichthyes , and List of prehistoric cartilaginous fish <P> Cartilaginous fishes , class Chondrichthyes , consisting of sharks , rays and chimaeras , appeared by about 395 million years ago , in the middle Devonian , evolving from acanthodians . The class contains the sub classes Holocephali ( chimaera ) and Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) . The radiation of elasmobranches in the chart on the right is divided into the taxa : Cladoselache , Eugeneodontiformes , Symmoriida , Xenacanthiformes , Ctenacanthiformes , Hybodontiformes , Galeomorphi , Squaliformes and Batoidea . </P> <H3> Bony fishes ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Osteichthyes , List of transitional fossils § Bony fish , and List of prehistoric bony fish <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Chordate Evolution and Bony Fish YouTube </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Bony fishes , class Osteichthyes , are characterised by bony skeleton rather than cartilage . They appeared in the late Silurian , about 419 million years ago . The recent discovery of Entelognathus strongly suggests that bony fishes ( and possibly cartilaginous fishes , via acanthodians ) evolved from early placoderms . A subclass of the Osteichthyes , the ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) , have become the dominant group of fishes in the post-Paleozoic and modern world , with some 30,000 living species . </P> <P> The bony ( and cartilaginous ) fish groups that emerged after the Devonian , were characterised by steady improvements in foraging and locomotion . </P> Lobe - finned fishes ( edit ) Further information : Sarcopterygii and List of lobe - finned fishes The Queensland lungfish is a lobe - finned fish that is a living fossil . Lungfish evolved the first proto - lungs and proto - limbs . They developed the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian ( 397 - 385 Ma ) , and have remained virtually the same for over 100 million years . Phylogenomic analysis has shown that `` the closest living fish to the tetrapod ancestor is the lungfish , not the coelacanth '' . <P> Lobe - finned fishes , fish belonging to the class Sarcopterygii , are mostly extinct bony fishes , basally characterised by robust and stubby lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton , cosmoid scales and internal nostrils . Their fins are fleshy , lobed , paired fins , joined to the body by a single bone . The fins of lobe - finned fish differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy , lobelike , scaly stalk extending from the body . The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to . The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates , amphibians . They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases , as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray - finned fish . The braincase of lobe - finned fishes primitively has a hinge line , but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish . Many early lobe - finned fishes have a symmetrical tail . All lobe - finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel . </P> <P> Lobe - finned fishes , such as coelacanths and lungfish , were the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian . Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within the Sarcopterygii , and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four - limbed vertebrates . The fin - limbs of lobe - finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs . The lobe - finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses , the Rhipidistia ( including the lungfish , and the Tetrapodomorpha , which include the Tetrapoda ) and the Actinistia ( coelacanths ) . The first lobe - finned fishes , found in the uppermost Silurian ( ca 418 Ma ) , closely resembled spiny sharks , which became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic . In the early -- middle Devonian ( 416 - 385 Ma ) , while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas , some lobe - finned fishes came into freshwater habitats . </P> The coelacanth is another lobe - finned fish that is a living fossil . It is thought to have evolved into roughly its current form about 408 million years ago , during the early Devonian , and has not essentially evolved further from its ancient form . <P> In the Early Devonian ( 416 - 397 Ma ) , the lobe - finned fishes split into two main lineages -- the coelacanths and the rhipidistians . The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the Late Devonian and Carboniferous , from 385 to 299 Ma , as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic ; coelacanths still live today in the oceans ( genus Latimeria ) . The Rhipidistians , whose ancestors probably lived in estuaries , migrated into freshwater habitats . They in turn split into two major groups : the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs . The lungfish 's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period ; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left . The lungfish evolved the first proto - lungs and proto - limbs ; developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian ( 397 - 385 Ma ) . The first tetrapodomorphs , which included the gigantic rhizodonts , had the same general anatomy as the lungfish , who were their closest kin , but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch ( 385 - 359 Ma ) , with the appearance of tetrapods ( four - legged vertebrates ) . Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian . Lobe - finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era , suffering heavy losses during the Permian - Triassic extinction event ( 251 Ma ) . </P> Ray - finned fishes ( edit ) <P> Ray - finned fishes , class Actinopterygii , differ from lobe - finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin supported by spines ( `` rays '' ) made of bone or horn . There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures . Ray - finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone , though this is not true of sturgeons and paddlefishes . </P> <P> Ray - finned fishes are the dominant vertebrate group , containing half of all known vertebrate species .

Pikaia is a genus that appeared about 530 Ma during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life . Pikaia gracilens ( pictured ) is a transitional fossil between invertebrates and vertebrates , and may be the earliest known chordate . In this sense it may have been the original ancestor of fishes . It was a primitive creature with no evidence of eyes , without a well defined head , and less than 2 inches ( 5 centimetres ) long . Pikaia was a sideways - flattened , leaf - shaped animal that swam by throwing its body into a series of S - shaped , zig - zag curves , similar to movement of snakes . Fish inherited the same swimming movement , but they generally have stiffer backbones . It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages , which may be linked to gill slits , on either side of its head . Pikaia shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates . The flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks , seen as faint vertical lines . The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Haikouichthys </Td> <Td> Haikouichthys ( fish from Haikou ) is another genus that also appears in the fossil record about 530 Ma , and also marks the transition from invertebrate to vertebrates . Haikouichthys are craniates ( animals with backbones and distinct heads ) . Unlike Pikaia , they had eyes . They also had a defined skull and other characteristics that have led paleontologists to label it a true craniate , and even to be popularly characterized as one of the earliest fishes .

They appeared 495 Ma and were wiped out 200 Ma . Initially they were known only from tooth - like microfossils called conodont elements . These `` teeth '' have been variously interpreted as filter - feeding apparatuses or as a `` grasping and crushing array '' . Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40 cm Promissum . Their large eyes had a lateral position of which makes a predatory role unlikely . The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts ( Promissum at least ) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed . In 2012 researchers classify the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays , chevron - shaped muscles and notochord . Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys , though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ostracoderms </Td> <Td> Ostracoderms ( shell - skinned ) are any of several groups of extinct , primitive , jawless fishes that were covered in an armour of bony plates .

It was about 15 cm ( 6 in ) long , with a streamlined body covered in rows of knobbly armoured scutes . The front of the body and the head were protected by hard plates with openings for the eyes , nostrils and gills . Although it was jawless , Arandaspis might have had some moveable plates in its mouth , serving as lips , sucking in food particles . The low position of its mouth suggests it foraged the ocean floor . It lacked fins and its only method of propulsion was its horizontally flattened tail . As a result , it probably swam in a fashion similar to a modern tadpole . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Astraspis </Td> <Td> Astraspis ( star shield ) is an extinct genus of primitive jawless fish related to other Ordovician fishes , such as Sacabambaspis and Arandaspis . Fossils show clear evidence of a sensory structure ( lateral line system ) . The arrangement of these organs in regular lines allows the fish to detect the direction and distance from which a disturbance in the water is coming . Arandaspis are thought to have had a mobile tail covered with small protective plates and a head region covered with larger plates . A specimen described by Sansom et al. had relatively large , lateral eyes and a series of eight gill openings on each side . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pteraspidomorphi </Td> <Td> Pteraspidomorphi is an extinct class of early jawless fish .

There is debate over whether these represent a monophyletic grouping , or disparate stem groups to the major lines of jawless and jawed fish . Thelodonts are united by their characteristic `` thelodont scales '' . This defining character is not necessarily a result of shared ancestry , as it may have been evolved independently by different groups . Thus the thelodonts are generally thought to represent a polyphyletic group . If they are monophyletic , there is no firm evidence on what their ancestral state was . These scales were easily dispersed after death ; their small size and resilience makes them the most common vertebrate fossil of their time . The fish lived in both freshwater and marine environments , first appearing during the Ordovician , and perishing during the Frasnian -- Famennian extinction event of the Late Devonian .

They first appeared in the early Silurian , and flourished until the Late Devonian extinction , where most species , save for lampreys , became extinct .

Anatomically speaking , the osteostracans , especially the Devonian species , were among the most advanced of all known agnathans . This is due to the development of paired fins , and their complicated cranial anatomy . The osteostracans were more similar to lampreys than to jawed vertebrates in possessing two pairs of semicircular canals in the inner ear , as opposed to the three pairs found in the inner ears of jawed vertebrates . Most osteostracans had a massive cephalothorac shield , but all Middle and Late Devonian species appear to have had a reduced , thinner , and often micromeric dermal skeleton . They were probably relatively good swimmers , possessing dorsal fins , paired pectoral fins , and a strong tail . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Spiny sharks </Td> <Td> Spiny sharks , more formally called `` Acanthodians '' ( having spines ) , constitute the class Acanthodii .

However , scales and teeth attributed to this group , as well as more derived jawed fish , such as cartilaginous and bony fish , date from the Ordovician ~ 460 Ma . Acanthodians were generally small shark - like fishes varying from toothless filter - feeders to toothed predators . They were once often classified as an order of the class Placodermi , but recent authorities tend to place the acanthodians as a paraphyletic assemblage leading to modern cartilaginous fish . They are distinguished in two respects : they were the earliest known jawed vertebrates , and they had stout spines supporting all their fins , fixed in place and non-movable ( like a shark 's dorsal fin ) , an important defensive adaptation .

Some placoderms were small , flattened bottom - dwellers , such as antiarchs . However many , particularly the arthrodires , were active midwater predators . Dunkleosteus , which appeared later in the Devonian below , was the largest and most famous of these . The upper jaw was firmly fused to the skull , but there was a hinge joint between the skull and the bony plating of the trunk region .

Axis scale : millions of years ago . <P> The Devonian Period is broken into the Early , Middle and Late Devonian . By the start of the Early Devonian 419 mya , jawed fishes had divided into four distinct clades : the placoderms and spiny sharks , both of which are now extinct , and the cartilaginous and bony fishes , both of which are still extant . The modern bony fishes , class Osteichthyes , appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian , about 416 million years ago . Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks . A subclass of bony fishes , the ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) , have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world , with some 30,000 living species . </P> <P> Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high . Marine faunas were dominated by bryozoa , diverse and abundant brachiopods , the enigmatic hederelloids , microconchids and corals . Lily - like crinoids were abundant , and trilobites were still fairly common . Among vertebrates , jawless armoured fish ( ostracoderms ) declined in diversity , while the jawed fish ( gnathostomes ) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water . Armoured placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian , perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species . Early cartilaginous ( Chondrichthyes ) and bony fishes ( Osteichthyes ) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas . The first abundant genus of shark , Cladoselache , appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period . The great diversity of fish around at the time have led to the Devonian being given the name `` The Age of Fish '' in popular culture . </P> <P> The first ray - finned and lobe - finned bony fish appeared in the Devonian , while the placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment . However , another subclass of Osteichthyes , the Sarcopterygii , including lobe - finned fishes including coelacanths and lungfish ) and tetrapods , was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian . Sarcopterygians are basally characterized by internal nostrils , lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton , and cosmoid scales . </P> <P> During the Middle Devonian 393 -- 383 Ma , the armoured jawless ostracoderm fishes were declining in diversity ; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater . The shallow , warm , oxygen - depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes , surrounded by primitive plants , provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time . Cartilaginous fishes , class Chondrichthyes , consisting of sharks , rays and chimaeras , appeared by about 395 million years ago , in the middle Devonian </P> <P> During the Late Devonian the first forests were taking shape on land . The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record over a period , the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events . This lasted until the end of the Devonian 359 mya . The ancestors of all tetrapods began adapting to walking on land , their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs ( see Tiktaalik ) . In the oceans , primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and the late Ordovician . The first ammonite mollusks appeared . Trilobites , the mollusk - like brachiopods and the great coral reefs , were still common . </P> <P> The Late Devonian extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period , the Famennian faunal stage , ( the Frasnian - Famennian boundary ) , about 372.2 Ma . Many fossil agnathan fishes , save for the psammosteid heterostracans , make their last appearance shortly before this event . The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community , and selectively affected shallow warm - water organisms rather than cool - water organisms . The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef - builders of the great Devonian reef - systems . </P> <P> A second extinction pulse , the Hangenberg event closed the Devonian period and had a dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas . Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event , as did most members of other groups including lobe - finned fishes , acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats , leaving only a handful of survivors . This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan="5"> Devonian ( 419 -- 359 mya ) : The start of Devonian saw the first appearance of lobe - finned fish , precursors to the tetrapods ( animals with four limbs ) .

Its rounded scales and body form indicate that it could have swum quickly through the water to catch prey . Similar to other rhipidistians , it had fang - like teeth on its palate in addition to smaller teeth on the jaws . Its asymmetrical tail sported a caudal fin on its lower end .

Their armor was reduced to a pattern of small plates around the head and neck .

Laccognathus grew to 1 -- 2 metres ( 3 -- 7 ft ) in length . They had very short dorsoventrally flattened heads , less than one - fifth the length of the body . The skeleton was structured so large areas of skin were stretched over solid plates of bone . This bone was composed of particularly dense fibers -- so dense that exchange of oxygen through the skin was unlikely .

It had a very weak jaw joint compared with modern - day sharks , but it compensated for that with very strong jaw - closing muscles . Its teeth were multi-cusped and smooth - edged , making them suitable for grasping , but not tearing or chewing . Cladoselache therefore probably seized prey by the tail and swallowed it whole . It had powerful keels that extended onto the side of the tail stalk and a semi-lunate tail fin , with the superior lobe about the same size as the inferior .

Like all other arthrodires , Coccosteus had a joint between the armour of the body and skull . In addition , it also had an internal joint between its neck vertebrae and the back of the skull , allowing it to open its mouth even wider . Along with the longer jaws , this allowed Coccosteus to feed on fairly large prey . As with all other arthrodires , Coccosteus had bony dental plates embedded in its jaws , forming a beak .

From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land , possibly so they could go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper . However , in 1987 , nearly complete fossils of Acanthostega from about 363 Ma showed that this Late Devonian transitional animal had legs and both lungs and gills , but could never have survived on land : its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight ; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight ; its fish - like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground . The current hypothesis is that Acanthostega , which was about 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) long , was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water . Its skeleton differed from that of most fish , in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged , including : its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air ; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together , providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head ; the head is not joined to the shoulder girdle and it has a distinct neck . </P> Until the 1980s early transitional lobe - finned fishes , such as the Eusthenopteron shown here , were depicted as emerging onto land . Paleontologists now widely agree this did not happen , and they were strictly aquatic . <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Tetrapod Evolution Animal Planet 1 2 3 4 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Evolution fish with fingers Transitional fossils -- YouTube </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air - breathing would have been an advantage : leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation ; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them ; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish ; air - breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen , since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen . </P> <P> There are three major hypotheses as to how tetrapods evolved their stubby fins ( proto - limbs ) . The traditional explanation is the `` shrinking waterhole hypothesis '' or `` desert hypothesis '' posited by the American paleontologist Alfred Romer . He believed limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up . </P> <P> The second hypothesis is the `` inter-tidal hypothesis '' put forward in 2010 by a team of Polish paleontologists led by Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki . They argued that sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from intertidal zones rather than inland bodies of water . Their hypothesis is based on the discovery of the 395 million - year - old Zachełmie tracks in Zachełmie , Poland , the oldest ever discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods . </P> <P> The third hypothesis , the `` woodland hypothesis '' , was proposed by the American paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack in 2011 . He argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water in woodlands as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation . He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded floodplains . </P> <P> Research by Jennifer A. Clack and her colleagues showed that the very earliest tetrapods , animals similar to Acanthostega , were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land . This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land -- either in search of prey ( like modern mudskippers ) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out -- and later evolved legs , lungs , etc . </P> <P> Two ideas about the homology of arms , hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years . First that digits are unique to tetrapods and second that antecedents were present in the fins of early sarcopterygian fish . Until recently it was believed that `` genetic and fossil data support the hypothesis that digits are evolutionary novelties '' . However new research that created a three - dimensional reconstruction of Panderichthys , a coastal fish from the Devonian period 385 million years ago , shows that these animals already had many of the homologous bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates . For example , they had radial bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm - like base of their fins . Thus there was in the evolution of tetrapods a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and eventually replaced by early digits . This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of actinopterygians , sharks and lungfish that the digits of tetrapods arose from pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish . Controversy still exists since Tiktaalik , a vertebrate often considered the missing link between fishes and land - living animals , had stubby leg - like limbs that lacked the finger - like radial bones found in the Panderichthys . The researchers of the paper commented that it `` is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is autapomorphic , that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent , or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik . At any rate , it demonstrates that the fish -- tetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures . '' . </P> <P> From the end of the Devonian to the Mid Carboniferous a 30 million year gap occurs in the fossil record . This gap , called Romer 's gap , is marked by the absence of ancestral tetrapod fossils and fossils of other vertebrates that look well - adapted for life on land . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan="4"> Transition from lobe - finned fishes to tetrapods </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ~ 385 Ma </Td> <Td> Eusthenopteron </Td> <Td> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Eusthenopteron -- Animal Planet </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Genus of extinct lobe - finned fishes that has attained an iconic status from its close relationships to tetrapods .

Freshwater habitats were not the only places to find water filled with organic matter and choked with plants with dense vegetation near the water 's edge . Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands , coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time , and there is much to suggest that this is the kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved . Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments , and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world , they must have spread by following the coastal lines -- they could not have lived in freshwater only . </P> <Ul> <Li> Fossil Illuminates Evolution of Limbs from Fins Scientific American , 2 2 April 2004 . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Post Devonian ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> The Mesozoic Era began about 250 million years ago in the wake of the Permian - Triassic event , the largest mass extinction in Earth 's history , and ended about 66 million years ago with the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , another mass extinction that killed off non-avian dinosaurs , as well as other plant and animal species .
