The Pelicans compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member club of the league 's Western Conference Southwest Division . The team plays their home games in the Smoothie King Center ( formerly known as the New Orleans Arena ) . </P> <P> The Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the 2002 -- 03 season when then - owner of the Charlotte Hornets , George Shinn , relocated the franchise to New Orleans . Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the franchise temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City , where they spent two seasons officially known as the New Orleans / Oklahoma City Hornets . The team returned to New Orleans full - time for the 2007 -- 08 season . On January 24 , 2013 , the franchise announced it would rename itself the Pelicans , effective after the conclusion of the 2012 -- 13 season . The Charlotte Hornets name , history and records from 1988 to 2002 were returned to its original city to be used by the then -- Charlotte Bobcats franchise , which subsequently became the Charlotte Hornets , starting May 20 , 2014 . </P> <P> In 14 seasons of play since the original franchise relocated from North Carolina , the Louisiana franchise has achieved an overall regular season record of 528 -- 604 , and has qualified for the playoffs six times . Their achievements include one playoff series victory and one division title . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Franchise history <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Relocation to New Orleans </Li> <Li> 1.2 2002 -- 2005 : Early years in New Orleans </Li> <Li> 1.3 2005 -- 2011 : Chris Paul era </Li> <Li> 1.4 2011 -- 2013 : CP3 's departure ; beginning the Anthony Davis era </Li> <Li> 1.5 2013 -- present : The Pelicans take flight <Ul> <Li> 1.5. 1 2015 : Return to the playoffs </Li> <Li> 1.5. 2 2017 -- present : Davis and Cousins era </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Logos and uniforms </Li> <Li> 3 Players <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Current roster </Li> <Li> 3.2 Retained draft rights </Li> <Li> 3.3 Retired numbers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Franchise records </Li> <Li> 5 Seasons <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Head coaches </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Home arenas </Li> <Li> 7 Mascot </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Franchise history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of the New Orleans Pelicans <H3> Relocation to New Orleans ( edit ) </H3> <P> While the Charlotte Hornets put a competitive team on the court throughout the 1990s , the team 's attendance began falling dramatically . Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team 's owner , George Shinn , who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city . In 1997 , a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her , and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city . The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball - crazy as ever , fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team . Shinn had also become discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum , which , although considered state - of - the - art when it opened in 1988 , had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes . On March 26 , 2001 , both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis , Tennessee , which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies . Shinn issued an ultimatum : unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him , the Hornets would leave town . The city initially refused , leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk , Louisville , or St. Louis . Of the cities in the running , only St. Louis had an NBA - ready arena ( Savvis Center , now known as Scottrade Center ) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time ; also , it was the only one of the four to have previously hosted an NBA franchise -- the St. Louis Hawks , who moved to Atlanta in 1968 . </P> <P> Finally , a new arena in Uptown , which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena ( now known as Spectrum Center ) , was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts - related package , and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team . Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage . However , just days before the referendum , Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance . The veto prompted many of the city 's black ministers to oppose the referendum ; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees were n't paid enough to make a living . After the referendum failed , city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support , but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team . While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans , league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners . The city council refused to remove the statement , leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans -- a move which would eventually return the NBA to that city since the Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979 . Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs , the NBA approved the move . As part of a deal , the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team , which took the court two years later as the Charlotte Bobcats . </P> <P> In a 2008 interview with the Charlotte Observer , Shinn , who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved , admitted that the `` bad judgment I made in my life '' played a role in the Hornets ' departure . He also said that if he had it to do all over again , he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial . Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying , `` I 've made enough mistakes in my life . I 'm not going to make one here . This city needs us here . We 're going to make this ( New Orleans ) thing work . '' </P> <H3> 2002 -- 2005 : early years in New Orleans ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hornets opened their inaugural season in New Orleans on October 30 , 2002 , against New Orleans ' original NBA franchise , the now - Utah Jazz . In the first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years , the Hornets defeated the Jazz 100 -- 75 , and posthumously retired # 7 of `` Pistol '' Pete Maravich during halftime . The Hornets finished the season with a 47 -- 35 record but were defeated by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs . Following the season , the team unexpectedly fired head coach Paul Silas and replaced him with Alan Bristow . The Hornets began the 2003 -- 04 season strong with a 17 -- 7 start but sputtered at the end and finished 41 -- 41 . They lost to the Miami Heat in the first round of the 2004 playoffs . After the season , Floyd was fired and the team hired Byron Scott as its new head coach . </P> <P> During the first two seasons in New Orleans the Hornets competed in the NBA 's Eastern Conference . The 2004 -- 05 season saw the team moved to the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . In a season marred by injury to the team 's three all - stars , the team finished the year with a franchise - worst record of 18 -- 64 . </P> <H3> 2005 -- 2011 : Chris Paul era ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the subsequent draft , the Hornets used their first round pick to select point guard Chris Paul out of Wake Forest University . </P> Chris Paul , selected by the Hornets as the 4th pick of the 2005 NBA draft <P> Because of the catastrophic devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina upon the communities of southeastern Louisiana , the Hornets franchise temporarily relocated its base of operations to Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , in 2005 -- 06 and 2006 -- 07 , posting records of 38 -- 44 and 39 -- 43 respectively . During this time , the franchise was known as the New Orleans / Oklahoma City Hornets . In these two seasons , most home games were played at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City , while a few remained at New Orleans Arena . One year after the Hornets moved back to New Orleans permanently , the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder . </P> <P> The Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full - time for the 2007 -- 08 season , with all 41 home games in the New Orleans Arena . The 2008 NBA All - Star Game and its accompanying festivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was commenced in February 2007 . Healthier than previous seasons , the Hornets raced to a 29 -- 12 record at the halfway mark , completing the regular season with a record of 56 -- 26 , making the season their most successful ever . The Hornets also won their first - ever division title , winning the Southwest Division . Having clinched the 2nd overall seed for the Western Conference in the 2008 playoffs , the Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks in the first round but eventually lost to the defending - champion San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the conference semifinals . </P> <P> In August 2008 the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the colors of Creole blue , purple , and Mardi Gras gold . Pinstripes were also added to the uniforms . The Hornets also introduced a new gold alternate uniform in 2010 which was used mostly in games played on Saturday at home and on the road . The Hornets finished the 2008 -- 09 season with a 49 -- 33 record . Paired up with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs , the Hornets were eliminated in five games . The Hornets started the 2009 -- 10 season in a disappointing fashion , and head coach Byron Scott was fired after a 3 -- 6 start to the season . General manager Jeff Bower took over the head coaching duties for the remainder of the season . The Hornets finished the season with a 37 -- 45 record , finishing last in the Southwest division they had won only two seasons before . Jeff Bower later resigned as head coach , and Monty Williams was brought in as new head coach . The team finished the 2010 -- 11 season with a 46 -- 36 record and qualified for the 2011 NBA Playoffs , where they lost to the Lakers 4 -- 2 . </P> <P> In December 2010 the NBA purchased the Hornets from George Shinn for an estimated $300 million . </P> <H3> 2011 -- 2013 : cp3 's departure ; beginning the Anthony Davis era ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before the 2011 -- 12 NBA season , the Hornets were considering trade offers for Chris Paul . Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks . The Hornets looked at many teams , including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners , but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles . A three - team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon , but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade . On December 14 , 2011 , the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon , Chris Kaman , Al - Farouq Aminu , and a first - round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004 . </P> <P> At the end of the 66 - game lockout - shortened 2011 -- 12 NBA season , the Hornets had the worst record in the West , 21 -- 45 . </P> <P> On April 13 , 2012 , it was announced that Tom Benson , owner of the New Orleans Saints , had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338 million . In addition , Benson announced that he would change the team name to something that would better suit the region , fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte , where the Bobcats play . In June 2012 , Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets as well : Saints general manager Mickey Loomis became head of basketball operations , overseeing general manager Dell Demps , and Saints business operations head Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets . </P> <P> The Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to the Wizards for Rashard Lewis , whom they bought out , and a draft pick . </P> <P> On May 30 , 2012 , the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft and subsequently drafted Anthony Davis . They also drafted Austin Rivers with the 10th pick ( acquired from the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade ) . </P> <P> On July 11 , 2012 , Ryan Anderson , 2012 's Most Improved Player and three - point field goals leader , was acquired in a sign - and - trade by the New Orleans Hornets , with the Orlando Magic , for Gustavo Ayón . </P> <H3> 2013 -- present : the Pelicans take flight ( edit ) </H3> <P> New owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team 's name to something more local , even preferring that the Utah Jazz -- founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979 , give up the `` Jazz '' name . But the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it . Benson had also heavily favored the names `` Brass '' and `` Krewe '' . </P> <P> However , on December 4 , 2012 , it was reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013 -- 14 season . The team name is inspired by Louisiana 's state bird , the brown pelican . </P> <P> The name `` Pelicans '' previously had been used by a minor - league baseball team that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957 . The Hornets organization officially confirmed the name change in a press conference held on January 24 , 2013 , where officials unveiled the team 's new logos and navy blue -- gold -- red color scheme . On April 18 , 2013 , after the end of the team 's 2012 -- 13 season , the team 's name was officially changed to the Pelicans . </P> <P> Following the New Orleans franchise 's 2013 disestablishment of the `` Hornets '' name , on May 21 , 2013 , Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014 -- 15 NBA season pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas , on July 18 , 2013 . Then - NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process . The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014 -- 15 . </P> <P> On June 27 , 2013 , during the 2013 NBA draft , the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall , and traded him along with a 2014 protected first - round pick for All - Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick , Pierre Jackson . At a May 20 , 2014 press conference announcing the Charlotte Bobcats ' official team name change to Hornets , it was also announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer the records and statistics of the original Hornets ( 1988 -- 2002 ) to the current Charlotte franchise , thus unifying all of Charlotte 's NBA basketball history under one franchise ; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to New Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans , retroactively turning the Pelicans into a 2002 expansion team . </P> <P> To restate and clarify a confusing series of events : after the 2002 season , the original Hornets moved to New Orleans . In 2004 , Charlotte was granted a new franchise , the Bobcats . After the 2013 -- 14 season , the Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988 -- 2002 Hornets . As a result , the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004 , while the Pelicans are now reckoned as having joined the league in 2002 . </P> 2015 : return to the playoffs ( edit ) Alvin Gentry is the New Orleans Pelicans current head coach . <P> For the first time under the name Pelicans , the team qualified for the playoffs with a 45 -- 37 record as the number 8 seed in the Western Conference . They owned the tie - breaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder by winning the regular season head - to - head series 3 -- 1 , and they faced the Golden State Warriors in the first round ; the Warriors swept the Pelicans in four games . After the season , the Pelicans fired coach Monty Williams despite qualifying for the playoffs . </P> <P> On May 31 , 2015 , the Pelicans hired Alvin Gentry as the franchise 's 6th head coach . </P> 2017 -- present : Davis and Cousins era ( edit ) <P> On February 20 , 2017 , Pelicans acquired DeMarcus Cousins in a trade with the Sacramento Kings when they traded Buddy Hield , Tyreke Evans , Langston Galloway , a 2017 1st round pick , and a 2017 2nd round pick in exchange for Cousins and Omri Casspi . </P> <H2> Logos and uniforms ( edit ) </H2> <P> The New Orleans Hornets were sold to Tom Benson on April 13 , 2012 . After purchasing the team , Benson indicated that he wanted to change the club 's nickname to something more regionally appropriate . On December 14 , 2012 , it was reported that the Hornets would change their nickname to the New Orleans Pelicans . On January 24 , 2013 , the team held a press conference , where it unveiled its new nickname , logos and colors . The name Pelicans is a reference to the brown pelican , the state bird of Louisiana . The team said in a press release that its colors would be navy , gold and red ; each color is represented in the city flag of New Orleans . The team formally adopted its new brand identity at the end of the 2012 -- 13 NBA season . </P> <P> On August 1 , 2013 , the Pelicans released their new uniforms . The ' New Orleans ' wordmark logo across the front of the jerseys is inspired by French Quarter street signs ; the Pelicans are one of three NBA teams to wear the city name across the front of both home and road jerseys . The partial logo is featured on the sides of the shorts , and the `` Bird - de-Lis '' logo ( a combination mark of the pelican , fleur - de-lis and crescent basketball shape ) is featured on the back neck . NBA teams were not allowed to have alternate uniforms during their first season of operation . </P> <P> On September 23 , 2014 , the Pelicans unveiled a red alternate uniform for the 2014 -- 15 season that would be worn four times in the year . Prior to the red alternate uniform unveiling , the NBA announced that its league logo would be moved to the back neck of game jerseys for all 30 clubs ; as a result , the NBA league logo replaced the `` Bird - de-Lis '' logo on the back neck . </P> <P> On September 17 , 2015 , the Pelicans unveiled a new alternate uniform , introduced as part of the NBA 's `` Pride '' uniforms for the 2015 -- 16 season . The short - sleeved uniforms feature Mardi Gras ' signature colors -- purple , green and gold . The tops are purple with green accents on the sleeves and sport ' NOLA ' ( a local acronym for New Orleans , Louisiana ) across the chest in the Pelicans ' signature font in gold letters trimmed in green . The Pelicans ' NO ' logo is featured at the bottom of the v - neck and the Crescent City basketball logo is on the left sleeve in Mardi Gras colors . Additionally , the trim around the neckline is purple , green and gold - striped . Additionally , on the back of the jersey , the players ' numbers will be gold with green trim , last name in white traditional lettering and the NBA logo will be featured at the base of the neck . The purple shorts will have green and gold stripes down the side with a small secondary logo -- the `` Bird - de-Lis '' in gold centered on the waistband . The Pelicans ' partial logo is on both sides of the shorts in Mardi Gras colors . </P> <H2> Players ( edit ) </H2> Main article : New Orleans Pelicans all - time roster See also : New Orleans Pelicans draft history <H3> Current roster ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan="2"> New Orleans Pelicans roster <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Players </Th> <Th> Coaches </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Pos . </Th> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Height </Th> <Th> Weight </Th> <Th> DOB ( YYYY - MM - DD ) </Th> <Th> From </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.0 !

He was introduced on October 30 , 2013 , the opening night of regular season for the team at home against the Indiana Pacers . The name for the mascot was selected by the fans through an online poll on the team 's website . However , Pierre 's unconventional design frightened some fans . The mascot 's redesigned head was released on February 11 . The Pelicans ' prior mascot was Hugo the Hornet , who was part of the organization from 2002 -- 13 . Hugo returned as the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets starting with the 2014 -- 15 season . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas '' .
