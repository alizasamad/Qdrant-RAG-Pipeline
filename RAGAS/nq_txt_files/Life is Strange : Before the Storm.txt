The three episodes were released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One between August and December 2017 . It is the second entry in the Life Is Strange series , set as a prequel to the first game , focusing on sixteen - year - old Chloe Price and her relationship with schoolmate Rachel Amber .

The player assumes control of sixteen - year - old Chloe Price , three years prior to Life Is Strange . Unlike its predecessor , the game does not include time travel . Instead , Before the Storm features the ability `` Backtalk '' , with which the player can call upon Chloe to get out of certain precarious situations ; `` Backtalk '' may also make a situation worse . A dialogue tree is used when a conversation or commentary is prompted . Occasional decisions will temporarily or permanently change outcomes . The environment can be interacted with and altered , including marking walls with graffiti . </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In her hometown of Arcadia Bay , sixteen - year - old Chloe Price sneaks into a house concert at an old mill . Conflict arises with two men inside , whom she evades when schoolmate Rachel Amber causes a distraction . The next day , Chloe and Rachel reunite at Blackwell Academy and decide to ditch class , stowing away on a cargo train and ending up at a lookout point . They people - watch through a viewfinder and see a man and woman kiss in the park , which upsets Rachel . They steal wine from local campers and take a walk to a scrapyard . Chloe confronts Rachel about her change in mood , but is refused an answer . After Rachel leaves , Chloe discovers the wrecked car in which her father was killed . She meets up with Rachel again , who discloses that she witnessed her father , James , cheating on her mother through the viewfinder . Rachel destroys a family photo in a burning trash bin , and in a fit of rage kicks it over , igniting a wildfire . </P> <P> The next day , Chloe and Rachel are reprimanded by Principal Wells for ditching school . Chloe hides out at the scrapyard where she finds an old truck in need of repairing . She then receives a call from local drug dealer Frank Bowers , who arranges a meeting to discuss settling her debt with him . Chloe agrees to repay him by helping him steal money from her classmate Drew , who owes Frank a large sum . However , Chloe finds out that Drew is being violently extorted by another drug dealer , Damon Merrick , and she must decide whether to pay off the dealer with the stolen money to protect Drew or keep it . When later a student is unable to participate in the school 's theater production of The Tempest due to road closures from the wildfire , Chloe reluctantly takes on the role opposite Rachel . After the play , they decide to leave Arcadia Bay with the newly repaired truck and return to Rachel 's house to pack . There , following a confrontation , James reveals that the woman they saw him kissing was not a mistress , but in fact Rachel 's biological mother . </P> <P> Rachel is told that her mother , Sera , is a drug addict , and that on the day her father kissed her , he had rejected Sera 's plea to see Rachel . Chloe vows to find Rachel 's mother , against James ' wishes . Chloe contacts Frank , who agrees to meet her at the scrapyard . She repairs the truck there before Rachel arrives . They are ambushed by Frank and Damon , who stabs Rachel after he realises she is the district attorney 's daughter . Surviving the wound , Rachel recovers at the hospital . Chloe continues the search by investigating James ' office for clues about Sera , instead revealing that James has been in contact with Damon ; Chloe uses James ' phone to convince Damon to disclose where Sera is located , and finds out that Damon has kidnapped her for ransom . She races to Damon to pay him off , but learns when she reaches him that James wanted him to kill Sera . Frank appears and fights Damon , after which Sera entreats that Chloe never tell Rachel about James ' actions . Back at the hospital , Chloe is faced with a choice : tell Rachel everything or protect her from the truth . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Publisher Square Enix chose Deck Nine to develop the prequel to Life Is Strange after the developer 's proprietary StoryForge tools had made an impression . Development started in 2016 with the Unity game engine . Rhianna DeVries , who initially did the game 's motion capture for Chloe Price , voices the character , while the original voice actress Ashly Burch serves as writing consultant . Burch did not reprise her role due to the SAG - AFTRA strike . With the strike over , Burch and Hannah Telle , who voiced Max Caulfield in Life Is Strange , will return for a bonus episode . The game went under different working titles during casting , according to Kylie Brown , who was cast as Rachel Amber ( then codenamed Rebecca ) in February 2017 . The music was written and performed by the British indie folk band Daughter , and released as an official soundtrack by Glassnote Records on 1 September 2017 . Instrumentation was employed to represent different sides of the lead character : piano for isolation , electric guitar for rebelliousness , and layered vocals for friendship . Daughter took the script and concept artwork as inspiration . The writers researched memoirs and psychology to understand the grieving process of the main character . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Prior to its official announcement , images had leaked online indicating that a prequel to Life Is Strange was in development . Square Enix revealed Life Is Strange : Before the Storm on 11 June during E3 2017 , stating that it would be released over three chapters starting on 31 August for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One . The Deluxe Edition includes the bonus chapter `` Farewell '' -- featuring Max Caulfield of the original game as a playable character -- three additional outfits , and Mixtape Mode , allowing players to customise playlists with the game 's soundtrack . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Episode </Th> <Th> Release date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="4"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 1 : Awake '' </Td> <Td> 31 August 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="4"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 2 : Brave New World '' </Td> <Td> 19 October 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="4"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Episode 3 : Hell Is Empty '' </Td> <Td> 20 December 2017 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Aggregate review scores <Tr> <Th> Game </Th> <Th> Metacritic </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Episode 1 : Awake </Th> <Td> ( PC ) 77 / 100 ( PS4 ) 78 / 100 ( XONE ) 80 / 100 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Episode 2 : Brave New World </Th> <Td> ( PC ) 78 / 100 ( PS4 ) 79 / 100 ( XONE ) 76 / 100 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Critics appraised Episode 1 : Awake the most on its character development of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber . Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found Chloe 's behaviour `` endearing '' and noted that her personality was portrayed with multiple layers . Sam Loveridge at GamesRadar wrote that Rachel was the more authentic character on account of her more `` grounded '' dialogue . Despite disparaging Chloe for being `` her same tiresomely combative self '' early on , Metro saw her fleshed out by enduring the loss of her father . Game Informer 's Kimberley Wallace thought the younger version of Chloe brought a `` naivety and vulnerability '' worthy of sympathy . Conversely , the relationship between the leads was said to have formed `` at unnatural speed '' . Peeples and Loveridge favoured the `` Backtalk '' gameplay feature , while Metro and Wallace cared little for it . Otherwise lauded were the story , graphics , voice acting , and soundtrack . </P> <P> Reviewers found Episode 2 : Brave New World to either be better than the first installment or one of the series ' greatest . Metro praised how choices made a difference with a `` profound effect '' on character arc , while Ozzie Mejia of Shacknews relished in Chloe 's `` genuine growth '' contrasting her `` fiery spirit '' . Similarly , Game Informer 's Joe Juba appreciated the continued comprehension of the character , declaring this `` its biggest strength '' . However , Juba 's biggest complaint echoed that of Wallace , in reference to the `` forced '' manner with which Chloe and Rachel are made friends . Brett Makedonski , writing for Destructoid , thought that the character exposition was done `` to great effect '' . Most noted was The Tempest school play sequence , which Metro stated as their favorite ; Mejia called `` one of the funniest '' in Before the Storm ; and Juba observed as the culmination of all past choices . Metro criticized the script for being `` uneven '' and disapproved of the voice acting . Mejia felt the ending could have been done away with , saying it was `` a bit drawn out '' , though he was impressed with the progression of the Backtalk feature . </P> <H3> Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following E3 2017 , Life Is Strange : Before the Storm received one of GamesRadar 's Best of E3 awards and was nominated for Hardcore Gamer 's Adventure Game award . It was nominated in the Games for Impact category at The Game Awards 2017 . At the 2017 Golden Joystick Awards , it was nominated for Best Audio . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Additional work by Square Enix London Studios </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Robertson , John ( 12 July 2017 ) . `` Life is Strange : Before the Storm is Chloe 's game '' .
