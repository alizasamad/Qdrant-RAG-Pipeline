An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres . </P> <P> In 1795 , when the metric system was introduced , the `` are '' was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( `` hecto - '' + `` are '' ) was thus 100 `` ares '' or ​ ⁄ km . When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960 , resulting in the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are was not included as a recognised unit . The hectare , however , remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units , mentioned in Section 4.1 of the SI Brochure as a unit whose use is `` expected to continue indefinitely '' . </P> <Table> Comparison of area units <Tr> <Th> Unit </Th> <Th> SI </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 ca </Td> <Td> 1 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 a </Td> <Td> 100 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 ha </Td> <Td> 10,000 m </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 100 ha </Td> <Td> 1,000,000 m 1 km </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan="2"> non-SI comparisons </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> non-SI </Th> <Th> metric </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 0.3861 sq mi </Td> <Td> 1 km </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.471 acre </Td> <Td> 1 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 107,639 sq ft </Td> <Td> 1 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 sq mi </Td> <Td> 259.0 ha </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 acre </Td> <Td> 0.4047 ha </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Units <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Centiare </Li> <Li> 2.2 Deciare </Li> <Li> 2.3 Are </Li> <Li> 2.4 Decare </Li> <Li> 2.5 Hectare </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Conversions </Li> <Li> 4 Visualising a hectare <Ul> <Li> 4.1 International rugby pitch </Li> <Li> 4.2 Statue of Liberty </Li> <Li> 4.3 Interior of all - weather athletics track </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The metric system of measurement was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the French Revolutionary government . The law of 18 Germinal , Year III ( 7 April 1795 ) defined five units of measure : </P> <Ul> <Li> The metre for length </Li> <Li> The are ( 100 m ) for area ( of land ) </Li> <Li> The stère ( 1 m ) for volume of stacked firewood </Li> <Li> The litre ( 1 dm ) for volumes of liquid </Li> <Li> The gram for mass </Li> </Ul> <P> Although the law defined the length of the metre , there was no practical way of accurately measuring the metre ( and hence the are ) until 1799 when the first standard metre was manufactured and adopted . </P> <P> The standard metre remained in the custody of successive French governments until 1875 when , under the Convention of the Metre , its supervision passed into international control under the auspices of the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) . At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889 when a new standard metre , manufactured by Johnson Matthey & Co of London was adopted , the are and hectare were automatically redefined . </P> <P> In 1960 , when the metric system was updated as the International System of Units ( SI ) , the are did not receive international recognition . The International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) makes no mention of the are in the current ( 2006 ) definition of the SI , but classifies the hectare as a `` Non-SI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units '' </P> <P> In 1972 , the European Economic Community ( EEC ) passed directive 71 / 354 / EEC , which catalogued the units of measure that might be used within the Community . The units that were catalogued replicated the recommendations of the CGPM , supplemented by a few other units including the are ( and implicitly the hectare ) whose use was limited to the measurement of land . </P> <P> Many UK farmers , especially older ones , still use the acre for everyday calculations , and convert to hectares only for official ( especially European Union ) paperwork . Farm fields can have very long histories which are resistant to change , with names such as `` the six acre field '' stretching back hundreds of years and across generations of family farmers . Some younger agricultural workers are now beginning to think in hectares as their `` first language '' , though this is more typical of professional consultants and managers than of traditional farming and land - owning families , and in some circles may be viewed as a social class indicator . </P> <H2> Units ( edit ) </H2> Definition of a hectare and of an are . <P> The names centiare , deciare , decare and hectare are derived by adding the standard metric prefixes to the original base unit of area , the are . </P> <H3> Centiare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The centiare is one square metre . </P> <H3> Deciare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The deciare is ten square metres . </P> <H3> Are ( edit ) </H3> <P> The are ( / ɑːr / or / ɛər / ) is a unit of area , equal to 100 square metres ( 10 m × 10 m ) , used for measuring land area . It was defined by older forms of the metric system , but is now outside the modern International System of Units ( SI ) . It is still commonly used in colloquial speech to measure real estate , in particular in Indonesia , India , and in various European countries . </P> <P> In Russian and other languages of the former Soviet Union , the are is called sotka ( Russian : сотка : ' a hundred ' , i.e. 100 m ) . It is used to describe the size of suburban dacha or allotment garden plots or small city parks where the hectare would be too large . </P> <P> Etymologically , the word are finds its roots in the Talmudic Aramaic word ארעא ( araa ) , meaning `` land '' . </P> <H3> Decare ( edit ) </H3> <P> The decare ( / ˈdɛkɑːr , - ɛər / ) is derived from deca and are , and is equal to 10 ares or 1000 square metres . It is used in Norway and in the former Ottoman areas of the Middle East and the Balkans ( Bulgaria ) as a measure of land area . Instead of the name `` decare '' , the names of traditional land measures are usually used , redefined as one decare : </P> <Ul> <Li> Stremma in Greece </Li> <Li> Dunam , dunum , donum , or dönüm in Israel , Palestine , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Turkey </Li> <Li> Mål is sometimes used for decare in Norway , from the old measure of about the same area . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Hectare ( edit ) </H3> Trafalgar Square has an area of about one hectare . <P> The hectare ( / ˈhɛktɛər , - tɑːr / ) , although not a unit of SI , is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use within the SI . In practice the hectare is fully derived from the SI , being equivalent to a square hectometre . It is widely used throughout the world for the measurement of large areas of land , and it is the legal unit of measure in domains concerned with land ownership , planning , and management , including law ( land deeds ) , agriculture , forestry , and town planning throughout the European Union . The United Kingdom , United States , Burma , and to some extent Canada use the acre instead . </P> <P> Some countries that underwent a general conversion from traditional measurements to metric measurements ( e.g. Canada ) required a resurvey when units of measure in legal descriptions relating to land were converted to metric units . Others , such as South Africa , published conversion factors which were to be used particularly `` when preparing consolidation diagrams by compilation '' . </P> <P> In many countries , metrication redefined or clarified existing measures in terms of metric units . The following legacy units of area have been redefined as being equal to one hectare : </P> <Ul> <Li> Jerib in Iran </Li> <Li> Djerib in Turkey </Li> <Li> Gong Qing ( 公頃 / 公顷 -- gōngqǐng ) in Hong Kong / mainland China </Li> <Li> Manzana in Argentina </Li> <Li> Bunder in The Netherlands ( until 1937 ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Conversions ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan="6"> Metric and imperial / US customary comparisons </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Unit </Td> <Td> Symbol </Td> <Td_colspan="3"> Metric equivalents </Td> <Td> Imperial / US customary equivalents </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> centiare </Td> <Td> ca </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 1 m </Td> <Td> 0.01 a </Td> <Td> 1.19599 sq yd </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> are </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 100 ca </Td> <Td> 100 m </Td> <Td> 0.01 ha </Td> <Td> 3.95369 perches </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> decare </Td> <Td> daa </Td> <Td> 10 a </Td> <Td> 1,000 m </Td> <Td> 0.1 ha </Td> <Td> 0.98842 roods </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> hectare </Td> <Td> ha </Td> <Td> 100 a </Td> <Td> 10,000 m </Td> <Td> 0.01 km </Td> <Td> 2.471 acres </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> square kilometre </Td> <Td> km </Td> <Td> 100 ha </Td> <Td> 1,000,000 m </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 0.38610 sq mi </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The most commonly used units are in bold . </P> <P> One hectare is also equivalent to : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1 square hectometre </Li> <Li> 15 mǔ or 0.15 qǐng </Li> <Li> 10 dunam or dönüm ( Middle East ) </Li> <Li> 10 stremmata ( Greece ) </Li> <Li> 6.25 rai ( Thailand ) </Li> <Li> ≈ 1.008 chō ( Japan ) </Li> <Li> ≈ 2.381 feddan ( Egypt ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Visualising a hectare ( edit ) </H2> <H3> International Rugby pitch ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Waikato Stadium -- Hamilton , New Zealand The maximum playing area of an international - sized rugby union pitch is about one hectare <P> On an international rugby union field the goal lines are up to 100 metres apart .
