During Mia 's twenty first birthday party , she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband . She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas . During the course of the night , Mia 's tiara falls off and is caught by a Member of Parliament , Viscount Mabrey , who secretly plans to steal Mia 's crown . While the Parliament is in - session the next morning , Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in . Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew , Lord Devereaux , is another heir to the Genovian throne . Despite Queen Clarisse 's objection , the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month . Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace , while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is actually Nicholas . Mia 's best friend , Lilly Moscovitz , surprises her by visiting . Together , they pick through potential husbands . Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby , Duke of Kenilworth , and days later , they are engaged . Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement . </P> <P> For a ceremony , Mia is to ride sidesaddle , but is inexperienced . Queen Clarisse provides an ancestral wooden leg decoy to make it look like she 's riding sidesaddle . Mabrey spooks Mia 's horse with a rubber snake , and Joe rushes to aid Mia , but accidentally tears off the wooden leg . Humiliated , Mia flees to the stables , where Nicholas fails to comfort her . At a garden party , Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia 's relationship with Andrew ; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she does n't love Andrew .

Nicholas pursues her even more , which causes both of them to fall into a fountain . Queen Clarisse finally tells Mia that her behavior with Nicholas needs to stop . </P> <P> During the Genovian Independence Day parade , Mia sees some boys harassing a little girl , and abruptly halts the parade to comfort the girl . Learning that the children are orphans , Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with her in the parade . Everyone is impressed by her act of generosity , while Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver . Mia later decides to convert one of the royal palaces into a temporary children 's center . That night , Mia has her bachelorette party , where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a duet with Princess Asana , one of Mia 's good friends . In the meantime , Mabrey realizes Nicholas has fallen for Mia , but Nicholas says that Mia will never love him . Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practicing her archery as part of her coronation rites . He helps her succeed in getting the arrow to hit the bullseye , something she had been struggling with . Nicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving , but asks to see her just one more time before he goes . She declines , saying she is under close guard . </P> <P> That night , Nicholas appears outside Mia 's window and asks her to come out . Lilly encourages her to go , and Mia sneaks out . They ride out to a lake where they share secrets , dance , and eventually fall asleep . They awaken to find a man in a boat videotaping them . Mia thinks Nicholas set her up , while he insists he had no idea . By the time Mia returns to the palace , the scandalous footage is already being broadcast . Andrew is disappointed and kisses Mia to see if there is a romantic spark between them . They realize that they do not love each other , but do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia . The wedding is to take place the following day , and Mia 's mother , Helen comes with her new husband , Patrick and their newborn son , Trevor .

Queen Clarisse encourages Mia to follow her heart , something she has never done and has now cost her Joe , the only man she truly loved . Mia reenters the church , and after pointing out how her grandmother has ruled Genovia while unmarried for a number of years , she tells the members of parliament in the audience to consider the significant women in their lives and questions if they would have them do what they 're trying to force her to do ( marry someone she does not love ) . Mabrey cites the law again and once again suggests that his nephew be named King , but just then , Nicholas not only refuses the crown , but also disowns Mabrey as his uncle . Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be abolished , and the Parliament unanimously gives its assent . Encouraged by Mia to have her own happy ending , Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly married . </P> <P> About a week later , Mia is preparing for her coronation when Nicholas shows up .
