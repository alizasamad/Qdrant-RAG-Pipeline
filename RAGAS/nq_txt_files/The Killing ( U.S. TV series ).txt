The Larsen murder case gets closed with the discovery of those involved in it . </P> <H3> Season 3 ( 2013 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Killing ( season 3 ) <P> A year after the Rosie Larsen case , Stephen Holder searches for a runaway girl and uncovers a string of murders connected to one of Sarah Linden 's previous murder investigations . Linden , no longer a detective , must return to both a career and a case she had put behind her . </P> <H3> Season 4 ( 2014 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Killing ( season 4 ) <P> The fourth season features detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder handling the fallout of their actions from the previous season while investigating the murder of a family whose only survivor is a member of an all - boys military academy . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The pilot was ordered by AMC in January 2010 and then was picked up for a full series order in August 2010 . The series is filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , with some scenes in season two filmed in Coquitlam , British Columbia , at Riverview Hospital . Production began on the pilot episode on December 2 , 2010 . The pilot is written by series creator and executive producer Veena Sud and is directed by Patty Jenkins . </P> <P> In contrast to the original Danish series , executive producer Veena Sud explained , `` We 're creating our own world . We are using the Danish series as a blueprint , but we are kind of diverging and creating our own world , our world of suspects and , potentially , ultimately who killed Rosie Larsen . '' Sud describes the series as `` slow - burn storytelling in a sense that every moment that we do n't have to prettify or gloss over or make something necessarily easy to digest , that we 're able to go to all sorts of places that are honest , and dark , and beautiful and tragic , in a way that is how a story should be told . '' </P> <H3> First cancellation and Revival ( edit ) </H3> <P> AMC announced on July 27 , 2012 that the series would not be renewed for a third season . However , Fox Television Studios announced that they were attempting to shop the show to other networks . In August 2012 , it was revealed that Fox Television Studios was in talks with both DirecTV and Netflix in an attempt to revive the series . In November 2012 , it was confirmed that Fox Television Studios was in final negotiations with Netflix to continue the series for a third season . AMC , which had originally canceled the show , was also included in the deal , which would gain the network the privilege of airing the new episodes before being hosted by Netflix , in return for sharing any associated production costs with Netflix . Variety reported on November 30 , 2012 , that the show would be returning to AMC , planning for a May 2013 debut , with production set to begin months before that . Cast members Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman were confirmed to return , with Veena Sud as showrunner and returning writers including executive producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin . On December 12 , 2012 , it was confirmed that cast members Billy Campbell , Michelle Forbes , and Brent Sexton would not return for the third season . </P> <P> On January 15 , 2013 , AMC and Fox Television Studios announced that the series had been renewed for a 12 - episode third season . Production started on February 25 , 2013 , in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , and ended on June 25 , 2013 . </P> <H3> Second cancellation and Revival ( edit ) </H3> <P> AMC ultimately canceled the series after the third season in September 2013 . However , in November 2013 , two months after its cancellation , Netflix announced it had picked up The Killing for a fourth and final season consisting of six episodes . Cast members Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman returned , with Veena Sud as showrunner , and executive producers Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin returning as writers . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reviewers and fans of three seasons of Veena Sud 's U.S. TV series , The Killing , have noted similarities and borrowed elements from David Lynch 's TV series Twin Peaks and the follow - up film Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me , and compared and contrasted Sud and Lynch 's works . </P> Season 1 ( edit ) <P> The series premiere was praised by most critics , Metacritic gave it a score of 84 / 100 based on reviews from 29 critics , indicating `` Universal acclaim '' . </P> <P> Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave the series a very positive review , calling it `` excellent , absorbing and addictive . When each episode ends , you long for the next -- a hallmark of great dramas . '' Goodman also praised Mireille Enos 's performance as the lead character Sarah , saying , `` It 's not until you watch Enos play Sarah for a while that it sinks in -- there has n't been a female American character like her probably ever . '' </P> <P> Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker gave it a B+ , saying , `` The acting is strikingly good '' and that `` ( s ) ome viewers may find The Killing a little too cold and deliberate , but give it time . Its intensity builds steadily , giving the series unexpected power . '' Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun said the series `` is soaked in atmosphere and steeped in the stark realism of Scandinavian crime novelists Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson '' and that it `` is not as much about a young girl 's murder as it is a psychological study of what happens afterward , how a tight - knit community tries to recover and how a dead child 's mother , father and siblings learn to deal with their pain in their own private ways . '' Matt Roush of TV Guide applauded the series , calling the acting `` tremendous '' and saying that he `` was instantly hooked by the moody atmosphere of this season - long murder mystery set in Seattle . '' He went on to say , `` What really stands out for me , in this age of cookie - cutter procedurals , is how The Killing dramatizes the devastation a violent death has on a family , a community , on the people involved in the investigation . Nothing about this show is routine . '' </P> <P> Subsequent episodes were met with lesser praise by some critics , criticizing the show 's reliance upon increasingly implausible red herrings to drive each episode and the withholding of details about each character 's background , especially Rosie 's , thus making them difficult to relate to or empathize with . </P> <P> The first - season finale was met with negative reviews from some critics . The Los Angeles Times called it `` one of the most frustrating finales in TV history , '' with Alan Sepinwall of HitFix.com calling the end `` insulting . '' Finally , Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said that the finale `` killed off any interest I had in ever watching the show again . '' `` ( The show ) began last spring looking like the smartest , most stylish pilot in years , '' complained Heather Havrilevsky in The New York Times Magazine . `` Fast - forward to the finale , in which we learn that what we 've been watching is actually a 26 - hour - long episode of Law & Order , and we 're only halfway through it . '' </P> Season 2 ( edit ) <P> The early seasonal episodes received generally favorable reviews from critics , with Metacritic giving it a score of 68 / 100 based on reviews from 23 critics . </P> <P> Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun - Times stated : `` Few television shows are as addictive as this pensive , wonderfully paced suspenser . '' The Washington Post 's Hank Stuever stated : `` My own enjoyment of The Killing begins and ends with the gloom so brilliantly conveyed by its pace and performances . '' Brian Lowry of Variety stated the series remained `` compelling , '' adding that `` the writers ... are adept at overcoming the stodgy pace by dangling tantalizing clues near each hour 's end , creating a strong pull to see what transpires next . '' HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall compared this season to the first and called it `` better . '' He added : `` The performances are still good , and now the characterization is a bit better . When you add that to the fine atmosphere ... and you view the mystery itself as a kind of necessary evil that allows you to see the parts of the show that do work , then it 's not bad . '' </P> <P> The season finale , `` What I Know , '' received mixed reviews . Sepinwall stated : `` I 'd like to say that season 2 of The Killing was an improvement on season 1 , and in some ways , it probably was . The second season certainly did a better job of doing what Veena Sud claimed to be doing last year , in that it took advantage of the extra time to sketch in some of the characters ... I honestly feel like any kinder feelings I have for the second season came from the complete lack of investment I had in it . '' Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the finale 4.7 out of 5 stars , but , upon first viewing , `` was n't sure what to feel . I was n't elated . I was n't excited '' but after watching it again was `` sucked into the world , mesmerized not by the victory of our hero cops ... but by the gut - wrenching moments that unfolded . '' CraveOnline 's William Bibbiani called the finale `` an odd duck . '' After citing Jamie 's early revelation as `` melodramatic silliness , '' Bibbiani added : `` The rest of the episode gets its job done , with one major , glaring flaw . The characters end up more or less where they need to be , but some nearly ridiculous loose ends remain . '' Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this finale a C - , calling it `` so unconvincing , '' adding `` I could n't believe how little all this resolution affected me after The Killing so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks ago . This is the same show that delivered Richmond 's hospital nightmare , the hunt for Holder , the anti-Western standoff `` Sayonara , Hiawatha , '' and the crazy train of the last two weeks ? No , this is the full - circle episode , the one that takes the show back to its roots . Wah wah .
