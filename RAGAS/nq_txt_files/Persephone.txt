Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic princess of the underworld , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead . Persephone was married to Hades , the god of the underworld . The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of vegetation , which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest ; hence , she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation . Similar myths appear in the Orient , in the cults of male gods like Attis , Adonis , and Osiris , and in Minoan Crete . </P> <P> Persephone as a vegetation goddess and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the Eleusinian mysteries , which promised the initiated a more enjoyable prospect after death . In some versions , Persephone is the mother of Zeus 's sons Dionysus , Iacchus , or Zagreus . The origins of her cult are uncertain , but it was based on very old agrarian cults of agricultural communities . </P> <P> Persephone was commonly worshipped along with Demeter and with the same mysteries . To her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of Anthesterion . In Classical Greek art , Persephone is invariably portrayed robed , often carrying a sheaf of grain . She may appear as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box , but she was mostly represented in the process of being carried off by Hades . </P> <P> In Roman mythology , she is called Proserpina , and her mother , Ceres and her father Jupiter . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Name <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 1.2 Roman Proserpina </Li> <Li> 1.3 Nestis </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Titles and functions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Epithets </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Origins of the cult <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Near East and Minoan Crete </Li> <Li> 3.2 Mycenean Greece </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Mythology <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Abduction myth </Li> <Li> 4.2 Interpretation of the myth </Li> <Li> 4.3 Arcadian myths </Li> <Li> 4.4 Queen of the Underworld </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Cult of Persephone <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Thesmophoria </Li> <Li> 5.2 Eleusinian mysteries </Li> <Li> 5.3 Local cults </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Ancient literary references </Li> <Li> 7 Modern reception </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes and references </Li> <Li> 10 Sources </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Name ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Etymology ( edit ) </H3> Persephone or `` the deceased woman '' holding a pomegranate . Etruscan terracotta cinerary statue . National archaeological museum in Palermo , Italy <P> In a Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) inscription on a tablet found at Pylos dated 1400 -- 1200 BC , John Chadwick reconstructed the name of a goddess * Preswa who could be identified with Persa , daughter of Oceanus and found speculative the further identification with the first element of Persephone . Persephonē ( Greek : Περσεφόνη ) is her name in the Ionic Greek of epic literature . The Homeric form of her name is Persephoneia ( Περσεφονεία , Persephoneia ) . In other dialects , she was known under variant names : Persephassa ( Περσεφάσσα ) , Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα ) , or simply Korē ( Κόρη , `` girl , maiden '' ) . Plato calls her Pherepapha ( Φερέπαφα ) in his Cratylus , `` because she is wise and touches that which is in motion '' . There are also the forms Periphona ( Πηριφόνα ) and Phersephassa ( Φερσέφασσα ) . The existence of so many different forms shows how difficult it was for the Greeks to pronounce the word in their own language and suggests that the name may have a Pre-Greek origin . </P> <P> Persephatta ( Περσεφάττα ) is considered to mean `` female thresher of grain '' ; the first constituent of the name originates in Proto - Greek `` perso - '' ( related to Sanskrit `` parṣa - '' ) , `` sheaf of grain '' and the second constituent of the name originates in Proto - Indo European * - gwn - t - ih , from the root * gwhen - `` to strike '' . </P> <P> An alternative etymology is from φέρειν φόνον , pherein phonon , `` to bring ( or cause ) death '' . </P> <H3> Roman Proserpina ( edit ) </H3> Cinerary altar with tabula representing the rape of Proserpina . White marble , Antonine Era , 2nd century Rome , Baths of Diocletian Persephone opening a cista containing the infant Adonis , on a pinax from Locri <P> The Romans first heard of her from the Aeolian and Dorian cities of Magna Graecia , who used the dialectal variant Proserpinē ( Προσερπίνη ) . Hence , in Roman mythology she was called Proserpina , a name erroneously derived by the Romans from proserpere , `` to shoot forth '' and as such became an emblematic figure of the Renaissance . </P> <P> At Locri , perhaps uniquely , Persephone was the protector of marriage , a role usually assumed by Hera ; in the iconography of votive plaques at Locri , her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an emblem of the marital state , children at Locri were dedicated to Proserpina , and maidens about to be wed brought their peplos to be blessed . </P> <H3> Nestis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a Classical period text ascribed to Empedocles , c. 490 -- 430 BC , describing a correspondence among four deities and the classical elements , the name Nestis for water apparently refers to Persephone : `` Now hear the fourfold roots of everything : enlivening Hera , Hades , shining Zeus . And Nestis , moistening mortal springs with tears . '' </P> <P> Of the four deities of Empedocles ' elements , it is the name of Persephone alone that is taboo -- Nestis is a euphemistic cult title -- for she was also the terrible Queen of the Dead , whose name was not safe to speak aloud , who was euphemistically named simply as Kore or `` the Maiden '' , a vestige of her archaic role as the deity ruling the underworld . </P> <H2> Titles and functions ( edit ) </H2> <P> The epithets of Persephone reveal her double function as chthonic and vegetation goddess . The surnames given to her by the poets refer to her character as Queen of the lower world and the dead , or her symbolic meaning of the power that shoots forth and withdraws into the earth . Her common name as a vegetation goddess is Kore , and in Arcadia she was worshipped under the title Despoina , `` the mistress '' , a very old chthonic divinity . Plutarch identifies her with spring and Cicero calls her the seed of the fruits of the fields . In the Eleusinian mysteries , her return is the symbol of immortality and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi . </P> <P> In the mystical theories of the Orphics and the Platonists , Kore is described as the all - pervading goddess of nature who both produces and destroys everything , and she is therefore mentioned along or identified with other mystic divinities such as Isis , Rhea , Ge , Hestia , Pandora , Artemis , and Hecate . The Orphic Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus , Iacchus , Zagreus , and the little - attested Melinoe . </P> <H3> Epithets ( edit ) </H3> <P> As a goddess of the underworld , Persephone was given euphemistically friendly names . However it is possible that some of them were the names of original goddesses : </P> <Ul> <Li> Despoina ( dems - potnia ) `` the mistress '' ( literally `` the mistress of the house '' ) in Arcadia . </Li> <Li> Hagne , `` pure '' , originally a goddess of the springs in Messenia . </Li> <Li> Melindia or Melinoia ( meli , `` honey '' ) , as the consort of Hades , in Hermione .

Depicted are female figures dancing among blossoming vegetation ; Heraklion Archaeological Museum <P> The myth of a goddess being abducted and taken to the Underworld is probably Pre-Greek in origin . Samuel Noah Kramer , the renowned scholar of ancient Sumer , has posited that the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone may be derived from an ancient Sumerian story in which Ereshkigal , the ancient Sumerian goddess of the Underworld , is abducted by Kur , the primeval dragon of Sumerian mythology , and forced to become ruler of the Underworld against her own will . </P> <P> The location of Persephone 's abduction is different in each local cult . The Homeric Hymn to Demeter mentions the `` plain of Nysa '' . The locations of this probably mythical place may simply be conventions to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past . Demeter found and met her daughter in Eleusis , and this is the mythical disguise of what happened in the mysteries . </P> <P> Persephone is an old chthonic deity of the agricultural communities , who received the souls of the dead into the earth , and acquired powers over the fertility of the soil , over which she reigned . The earliest depiction of a goddess who may be identified with Persephone growing out of the ground , is on a plate from the Old - Palace period in Phaistos . The goddess has a vegetable - like appearance , and she is surrounded by dancing girls between blossoming flowers . A similar representation , where the goddess appears to come down from the sky , is depicted on the Minoan ring of Isopata . </P> Rape of Persephone . Hades with his horses and Persephone ( down ) . An Apulian red - figure volute krater , c. 340 BC . Antikensammlung Berlin <P> In some forms Hades appears with his chthonic horses . The myth of the rape of Kore was derived from the idea that Hades catches the souls of the dead and then carries them with his horses into his kingdom . This idea is vague in Homer , but appears in later Greek depictions , and in Greek folklore . `` Charos '' appears with his horse and carries the dead into the underworld . </P> <P> The cults of Persephone and Demeter in the Eleusinian mysteries and in the Thesmophoria were based on old agrarian cults . A lot of ancient beliefs were based on initiation into jealously - guarded mysteries ( secret rites ) because they offered prospects after death more enjoyable than the final end at the gloomy space of the Greek Hades . There is evidence that some practices were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenaean age . Kerenyi asserts that these religious practices were introduced from Minoan Crete. , The idea of immortality which appears in the syncretistic religions of the Near East did not exist in the Eleusinian mysteries at the very beginning . </P> <H3> Near east and Minoan Crete ( edit ) </H3> Lady of Auxerre Louvre - An Archaic ( 640 BC ) image from Crete . A version of a Minoan goddess who may be identified with Kore <P> In the Near eastern myth of the early agricultural societies , every year the fertility goddess bore the `` god of the new year '' , who then became her lover , and died immediately in order to be reborn and face the same destiny . Some findings from Catal Huyuk since the Neolithic age , indicate the worship of the Great Goddess accompanied by a boyish consort , who symbolizes the annual decay and return of vegetation . Similar cults of resurrected gods appear in the Near East and Egypt in the cults of Attis , Adonis and Osiris . </P> <P> In Minoan Crete , the `` divine child '' was related to the female vegetation divinity Ariadne who died every year . The Minoan religion had its own characteristics . The most peculiar feature of the Minoan belief in the divine , is the appearance of the goddess from above in the dance . Dance floors have been discovered in addition to `` vaulted tombs '' , and it seems that the dance was ecstatic . Homer memorializes the dance floor which Daedalus built for Ariadne in the remote past . On the gold ring from Isopata , four women in festal attire are performing a dance between blossoming flowers . Above a figure apparently floating in the air seems to be the goddess herself , appearing amid the whirling dance . An image plate from the first palace of Phaistos , seems to be very close to the mythical image of the Anodos ( ascent ) of Persephone . Two girls dance between blossoming flowers , on each side of a similar but armless and legless figure which seems to grow out of the ground . The goddess is bordered by snake lines which give her a vegetable like appearance She has a large stylized flower turned over her head . The resemblance with the flower - picking Persephone and her companions is compelling . The depiction of the goddess is similar to later images of `` Anodos of Pherephata '' . On the Dresden vase , Persephone is growing out of the ground , and she is surrounded by the animal - tailed agricultural gods Silenoi . </P> <P> Kerenyi suggests that the name Ariadne ( derived from ἁγνή , hagne , `` pure '' ) , was an euphemistical name given by the Greeks to the nameless `` Mistress of the labyrinth '' who appears in a Mycenean Greek inscription from Knossos in Crete . The Greeks used to give friendly names to the deities of the underworld . Cthonic Zeus was called Eubuleus , `` the good counselor '' , and the ferryman of the river of the underworld Charon , `` glad '' . Despoina and `` Hagne '' were probably euphemistic surnames of Persephone , therefore he theorizes that the cult of Persephone was the continuation of the worship of a Minoan Great goddess . The labyrinth was both a winding dance - ground and , in the Greek view , a prison with the dreaded Minotaur at its centre . It is possible that some religious practices , especially the mysteries , were transferred from a Cretan priesthood to Eleusis , where Demeter brought the poppy from Crete . Besides these similarities , Burkert explains that up to now it is not known to what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenean religion . In the Anthesteria Dionysos is the `` divine child '' . </P> <H3> Mycenean Greece ( edit ) </H3> Two women or goddesses on a chariot . Fresco from Tiryns , 1200 BC . National Archaeological Museum of Athens . <P> There is evidence of a cult in Eleusis from the Mycenean period ; however , there are not sacral finds from this period . The cult was private and there is no information about it . As well as the names of some Greek gods in the Mycenean Greek inscriptions , also appear names of goddesses , like `` the divine Mother '' ( the mother of the gods ) or `` the Goddess ( or priestess ) of the winds '' , who do n't have Mycenean origin . In historical times , Demeter and Kore were usually referred to as `` the goddesses '' or `` the mistresses '' ( Arcadia ) in the mysteries . In the Mycenean Greek tablets dated 1400 -- 1200 BC , the `` two queens and the king '' are mentioned . John Chadwick believes that these were the precursor divinities of Demeter , Persephone and Poseidon . </P> <P> Some information can be obtained from the study of the cult of Eileithyia at Crete , and the cult of Despoina . In the cave of Amnisos at Crete , Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with Enesidaon ( The earth shaker ) , who is the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon . Persephone was conflated with Despoina , `` the mistress '' , a chthonic divinity in West - Arcadia . The megaron of Eleusis is quite similar with the `` megaron '' of Despoina at Lycosura . Demeter is united with the god Poseidon , and she bears a daughter , the unnameable Despoina . Poseidon appears as a horse , as it usually happens in Northern European folklore . The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult , where the following words were uttered `` Mighty Potnia bore a great sun '' . In Eleusis , in a ritual , one child ( `` pais '' ) was initiated from the hearth . The name pais ( the divine child ) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions , and the ritual indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the Greek cremation . </P> <P> In Greek mythology Nysa is a mythical mountain with an unknown location . Nysion ( or Mysion ) , the place of the abduction of Persephone was also probably a mythical place which did not exist on the map , a magically distant chthonic land of myth which was intended in the remote past . </P> <H2> Mythology ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Abduction myth ( edit ) </H3> Sarcophagus with the abduction of Persephone . Walters Art Museum . Baltimore , Maryland <P> The story of her abduction by Hades against her will is traditionally referred to as the Rape of Persephone . It is mentioned briefly in Hesiod 's Theogony , and told in considerable detail in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter . Persephone used to live far away from the other gods , a goddess within Nature herself before the days of planting seeds and nurturing plants . In the Olympian telling , the gods Hermes and Apollo had wooed Persephone ; but Demeter rejected all their gifts and hid her daughter away from the company of the Olympian gods . Zeus , it is said , permitted Hades , who was in love with the beautiful Persephone , to abduct her as her mother Demeter was not likely to allow her daughter to go down to Hades . Persephone was gathering flowers with the Oceanids along with Artemis and Athena -- the Homeric Hymn says -- in a field when Hades came to abduct her , bursting through a cleft in the earth . Demeter , when she found her daughter had disappeared , searched for her all over the earth with Hecate 's torches . In most versions she forbids the earth to produce , or she neglects the earth and in the depth of her despair she causes nothing to grow . Helios , the sun , who sees everything , eventually told Demeter what had happened and at length she discovered the place of her abode . Finally , Zeus , pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish , forced Hades to return Persephone . </P> The Rape of Proserpina by Gian Lorenzo Bernini at the Galleria Borghese in Rome . <P> Hades indeed complied with the request , but first he tricked her , giving her some pomegranate seeds to eat . Persephone was released by Hermes , who had been sent to retrieve her , but because she had tasted food in the underworld , she was obliged to spend a third of each year ( the winter months ) there , and the remaining part of the year with the gods above . With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus , Persephone 's time in the underworld becomes half the year . </P> <P> Various local traditions place Persephone 's abduction in a different location . The Sicilians , among whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists , believed that Hades found her in the meadows near Enna , and that a well arose on the spot where he descended with her into the lower world . The Cretans thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape , and the Eleusinians mentioned the Nysian plain in Boeotia , and said that Persephone had descended with Hades into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus . Later accounts place the rape in Attica , near Athens , or near Eleusis . </P> The return of Persephone , by Frederic Leighton ( 1891 ) <P> The Homeric hymn mentions the Nysion ( or Mysion ) which was probably a mythical place . The location of this mythical place may simply be a convention to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past . Before Persephone was abducted by Hades , the shepherd Eumolpus and the swineherd Eubuleus saw a girl in a black chariot driven by an invisible driver being carried off into the earth which had violently opened up . Eubuleus was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her , and the myth is an etiology for the relation of pigs with the ancient rites in Thesmophoria , and in Eleusis . </P> <P> In the hymn , Persephone returns and she is reunited with her mother near Eleusis . Demeter as she has been promised established her mysteries ( orgies ) when the Eleusinians built for her a temple near the spring of Callichorus . These were awful mysteries which were not allowed to be uttered . The uninitiated would spend a miserable existence in the gloomy space of Hades after death . </P> <P> In some versions , Ascalaphus informed the other deities that Persephone had eaten the pomegranate seeds . When Demeter and her daughter were reunited , the Earth flourished with vegetation and color , but for some months each year , when Persephone returned to the underworld , the earth once again became a barren realm . This is an origin story to explain the seasons . </P> <P> In an earlier version , Hecate rescued Persephone . On an Attic red - figured bell krater of c. 440 BC in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Persephone is rising as if up stairs from a cleft in the earth , while Hermes stands aside ; Hecate , holding two torches , looks back as she leads her to the enthroned Demeter . </P> <P> The 10th - century Byzantine encyclopedia Suda introduces a goddess of a blessed afterlife assured to Orphic mystery initiates . This Macaria is asserted to be the daughter of Hades , but no mother is mentioned . </P> <H3> Interpretation of the myth ( edit ) </H3> Pinax of Persephone and Hades from Locri . Reggio Calabria , National Museum of Magna Graecia . <P> In the myth Pluto abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm . Pluto ( Πλούτων , Ploutōn ) was a name for the ruler of the underworld ; the god was also known as Hades , a name for the underworld itself . The name Pluton was conflated with that of Ploutos ( Πλούτος Ploutos , `` wealth '' ) , a god of wealth , because mineral wealth was found underground , and because Pluto as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest . Plouton is lord of the dead , but as Persephone 's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility . </P> <P> In the Theogony of Hesiod , Demeter was united with the hero Iasion in Crete and she bore Ploutos . This union seems to be a reference to a hieros gamos ( ritual copulation ) to ensure the earth 's fertility . This ritual copulation appears in Minoan Crete , in many Near Eastern agricultural societies , and also in the Anthesteria . </P> <P> Nilsson believes that the original cult of Ploutos ( or Pluto ) in Eleusis was similar with the Minoan cult of the `` divine child '' , who died in order to be reborn . The child was abandoned by his mother and then it was brought up by the powers of nature . Similar myths appear in the cults of Hyakinthos ( Amyklai ) , Erichthonios ( Athens ) , and later in the cult of Dionysos . </P> <P> The Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain -- important and rare in the Greek environment -- and the return ( ascent ) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing . Pluto ( Ploutos ) represents the wealth of the grain that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars ( pithoi ) , during summer months . Similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for burials and Pluto is fused with Hades , the King of the realm of the dead . During summer months , the Greek grain - Maiden ( Kore ) is lying in the grain of the underground silos in the realm of Hades , and she is fused with Persephone , the Queen of the Underworld . At the beginning of the autumn , when the seeds of the old crop are laid on the fields , she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter , for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other . For the initiated , this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life that flows from the generations which spring from each other . </P> <H3> Arcadian myths ( edit ) </H3> From L-R , Artemis , Demeter , Veil of Despoina , Anytus , Tritoness from the throne of Despoina at Lycosura . National Archaeological Museum of Athens <P> The primitive myths of isolated Arcadia seem to be related to the first Greek - speaking people who came from the north - east during the bronze age . Despoina ( the mistress ) , the goddess of the Arcadian mysteries , is the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios ( horse ) , who represents the river spirit of the underworld that appears as a horse as often happens in northern - European folklore . He pursues the mare - Demeter and from the union she bears the horse Arion and a daughter who originally had the form or the shape of a mare . The two goddesses were not clearly separated and they were closely connected with the springs and the animals . They were related with the god of rivers and springs ; Poseidon and especially with Artemis , the Mistress of the Animals who was the first nymph . According to the Greek tradition a hunt - goddess preceded the harvest goddess . In Arcadia , Demeter and Persephone were often called Despoinai ( Δέσποιναι , `` the mistresses '' ) in historical times . They are the two Great Goddesses of the Arcadian cults , and evidently they come from a more primitive religion . The Greek god Poseidon probably substituted the companion ( Paredros , Πάρεδρος ) of the Minoan Great goddess in the Arcadian mysteries . </P> Seated goddess , probably Persephone on her throne in the underworld , Severe style ca 480 -- 60 , found at Tarentum , Magna Graecia ( Pergamon Museum , Berlin ) <H3> Queen of the underworld ( edit ) </H3> <P> Persephone held an ancient role as the dread queen of the Underworld , within which tradition it was forbidden to speak her name . This tradition comes from her conflation with the very old chthonic divinity Despoina ( the mistress ) , whose real name could not be revealed to anyone except those initiated to her mysteries . As goddess of death she was also called a daughter of Zeus and Styx , the river that formed the boundary between Earth and the underworld . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic queen of the shades , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead , along with her husband Hades . In the reformulation of Greek mythology expressed in the Orphic Hymns , Dionysus and Melinoe are separately called children of Zeus and Persephone . Groves sacred to her stood at the western extremity of the earth on the frontiers of the lower world , which itself was called `` house of Persephone '' . </P> <P> Her central myth served as the context for the secret rites of regeneration at Eleusis , which promised immortality to initiates . </P> <H2> Cult of Persephone ( edit ) </H2> <P> Persephone was worshipped along with her mother Demeter and in the same mysteries . Her cults included agrarian magic , dancing , and rituals . The priests used special vessels and holy symbols , and the people participated with rhymes . In Eleusis there is evidence of sacred laws and other inscriptions . </P> <P> The Cult of Demeter and the Maiden is found at Attica , in the main festivals Thesmophoria and Eleusinian mysteries and in a lot of local cults . These festivals were almost always celebrated at the autumn sowing , and at full - moon according to the Greek tradition . In some local cults the feasts were dedicated to Demeter . </P> <H3> Thesmophoria ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Thesmophoria Kore , daughter of Demeter , celebrated with her mother by the Thesmophoriazusae ( women of the festival ) . Acropolis Museum , Athens <P> Thesmophoria , were celebrated in Athens , and the festival was widely spread in Greece . This was a festival of secret women - only rituals connected with marriage customs and commemorated the third of the year , in the month Pyanepsion , when Kore was abducted and Demeter abstained from her role as goddess of harvest and growth . The ceremony involved sinking sacrifices into the earth by night and retrieving the decaying remains of pigs that had been placed in the megara of Demeter ( trenches and pits or natural clefts in rock ) , the previous year . These were placed on altars , mixed with seeds , then planted . Pits rich in organic matter at Eleusis have been taken as evidence that the Thesmophoria was held there as well as in other demes of Attica . This agrarian magic was also used in the cult of the earth - goddesses potniai ( mistresses ) in the Cabeirian , and in Knidos . </P> <P> The festival was celebrated over three days . The first was the `` way up '' to the sacred space , the second , the day of feasting when they ate pomegranate seeds and the third was a meat feast in celebration of Kalligeneia a goddess of beautiful birth . Zeus penetrated the mysteries as Zeus - Eubuleus which is an euphemistical name of Hades ( Chthonios Zeus ) . In the original myth which is an etiology for the ancient rites , Eubuleus was a swineherd who was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton . His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her . </P> <H3> Eleusinian mysteries ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Eleusinian mysteries The Eleusinian trio : Persephone , Triptolemus and Demeter on a marble bas - relief from Eleusis , 440 -- 430 BC . National Archaeological Museum of Athens <P> The Eleusinian mysteries was a festival celebrated at the autumn sowing in the city of Eleusis . Inscriptions refer to `` the Goddesses '' accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemos ( probably son of Ge and Oceanus ) , and `` the God and the Goddess '' ( Persephone and Plouton ) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld . The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases : the `` descent '' , the `` search '' , and the `` ascent '' , with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation . The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter . The festival activities included dancing , probably across the Rharian field , where according to the myth the first grain grew . </P> <P> At the beginning of the feast , the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out , the one towards the west , and the other towards the east . The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme `` rain and conceive '' . In a ritual , a child was initiated from the hearth ( the divine fire ) . It was the ritual of the `` divine child '' who originally was Ploutos . In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos The high point of the celebration was `` an ear of grain cut in silence '' , which represented the force of the new life . The idea of immortality did n't exist in the mysteries at the beginning , but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld . Death remained a reality , but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed . In the earliest depictions Persephone is an armless and legless deity , who grows out of the ground . </P> <H3> Local cults ( edit ) </H3> A mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto , 4th century BC Hades abducting Persephone , wall painting in the small royal tomb at Vergina .

Brooklyn Museum Archives , Goodyear Archival Collection Fragment of a marble relief depicting a Kore , 3rd century BC , from Panticapaeum , Taurica ( Crimea ) , Bosporan Kingdom <P> Local cults of Demeter and Kore existed in Greece , Asia Minor , Sicily , Magna Graecia , and Libya . </P> <Ul> <Li> Attica : <Ul> <Li> Athens , in the mysteries of Agrae . This was a local cult near the river Ilissos . They were celebrated during spring in the month Anthesterion . Later they became an obligation for the participants of the `` greater '' Eleusinian mysteries . There was a temple of Demeter and Kore and an image of Triptolemos . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Demeter drives her horse - drawn chariot containing her daughter Persephone at Selinunte , Sicily 6th century BC <Ul> <Li> <Ul> <Li> Piraeus : The Skirophoria , a festival related to the Thesmophoria . </Li> <Li> Megara : Cult of Demeter thesmophoros and Kore . The city was named after its megara . </Li> <Li> Aegina : Cult of Demeter thesmophoros and Kore . </Li> <Li> Phlya , near Koropi , in the mysteries of Phlya : These have very old roots and were probably originally dedicated to Demeter Anesidora , Kore , and Zeus Ktesios , who was the god of the underground stored grain . Pausanias mentions a temple of Demeter - Anesidora , Kore Protogone , and Zeus Ktesios . The surname Protogonos , indicates a later Orphic influence . It seems that the mysteries were related to the mysteries of Andania in Messene . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Boeotia : <Ul> <Li> Thebes , which Zeus is said to have given to her as an acknowledgement for a favour she had bestowed upon him . Pausanias records a grove of Cabeirian Demeter and the Maid , three miles outside the gates of Thebes , where a ritual was performed , so - called on the grounds that Demeter gave it to the Cabeiri , who established it at Thebes . The Thebans told Pausanias that some inhabitants of Naupactus had performed the same rituals there , and had met with divine vengeance . The Cabeirian mysteries were introduced from Asia Minor at the end of the archaic period . Nothing is known of the older cult , and it seems that the Cabeiri were originally wine - daemons . Inscriptions from the temple in Thebes mention the old one as Cabir , and the new one as son ( pais ) , who are different . According to Pausanias , Pelarge , the daughter of Potnieus , was connected with the cult of Demeter in the Cabeirian ( potniai ) . </Li> <Li> A feast in Boeotia , in the month Demetrios ( Pyanepsion ) , probably similar with the Thesmophoria . </Li> <Li> Thebes : Cult of Demeter and Kore in a feast named Thesmophoria but probably different .

In the myth Demeter was united with Poseidon Hippios ( horse ) and bore the horse Arion and the unnamed .

The temple was built near a spring . </Li> <Li> Lycosura , Main article : Despoina Cult of Demeter and Despoina . In the portico of the temple of Despoina there was a tablet with the inscriptions of the mysteries . In front of the temple there was an altar to Demeter and another to Despoine , after which was one of the Great Mother . By the sides stood Artemis and Anytos , the Titan who brought up Despoine . Besides the temple , there was also a hall where the Arcadians celebrated the mysteries A fire was always burning in front of the temple of Pan ( the goat - god ) , the god of the wild , shepherds and flocks .

In 1961 , Frederick Ashton of the Royal Ballet appropriated Stravinsky 's score , to choreograph a ballet starring Svetlana Beriosova as Persephone . </P> <P> Persephone also appears many times in popular culture . Featured in a variety of young adult novels such as `` Persephone '' by Kaitlin Bevis , `` Persephone 's Orchard '' by Molly Ringle , `` The Goddess Test '' by Aimee Carter , `` The Goddess Letters '' by Carol Orlock , and `` Abandon '' by Meg Cabot , her story has also been treated by Suzanne Banay Santo in `` Persephone Under the Earth '' in the light of women 's spirituality . Here Santo treats the mythic elements in terms of maternal sacrifice to the burgeoning sexuality of an adolescent daughter . Accompanied by the classic , sensual paintings of Frederic Lord Leighton and William - Adolphe Bouguereau , Santo portrays Persephone not as a victim but as a woman in quest of sexual depth and power , transcending the role of daughter , though ultimately returning to it as an awakened Queen . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Greek mythology portal </Li> <Li> Hellenismos portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Eleusinian Mysteries </Li> <Li> Rape of Persephone </Li> <Li> Anthesphoria , festival honoring Proserpina , and Persephone </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes and references ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Notes </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The actual word in Linear B is 𐀟𐀩𐁚 , pe - re - * 82 or pe - re-swa ; it is found on the PY Tn 316 tablet . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Empedocles was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher who was a citizen of Agrigentum , a Greek colony in Sicily . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kingsley 1995 identifies Nestis as a cult title of Persephone . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hom .
