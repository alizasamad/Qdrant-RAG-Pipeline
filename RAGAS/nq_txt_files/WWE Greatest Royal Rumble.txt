The event is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match , a battle royal whose participants enter at timed intervals . The Greatest Royal Rumble included the largest version of the match to date , having a total of 50 participants . </P> <P> On March 5 , 2018 , WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble , a live event to be held on April 27 , 2018 , at King Abdullah International Stadium , part of the King Abdullah Sports City , in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . The event is a part of a 10 - year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030 , Saudi Arabia 's social and economic reform program . </P> <P> On March 19 , 2018 , WWE scheduled seven championship matches for the event : the WWE Championship , Universal Championship , United States Championship , Intercontinental Championship , SmackDown Tag Team Championship , Raw Tag Team Championship and Cruiserweight Championship were to be defended at the event . </P> <P> As revealed on March 22 , 2018 , the event was streamed live on the WWE Network . It also aired on traditional pay - per - view in the United States and internationally . The event was also the first WWE pay - per - view to feature Arabic commentary . </P> <P> In the weeks leading up to the event , the WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia . From these tryouts , eight were selected to receive training by WWE , which would include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event itself . </P> <H3> Storylines ( edit ) </H3> <P> The card comprised ten matches that resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by WWE on the Raw and SmackDown brands . Storylines were produced on WWE 's weekly television shows , Monday Night Raw , SmackDown Live , and the cruiserweight - exclusive 205 Live . </P> <P> On April 9 , Brock Lesnar , who had renewed his WWE contract , was scheduled to defend the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match as a rematch from WrestleMania 34 . On Raw following WrestleMania , Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his future matches and opponents , singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar . Reigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him . Samoa Joe , who had been out with an injury since January , came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again . </P> <P> On March 26 , WWE scheduled a ladder match between then - champion The Miz , Seth Rollins , Finn Bálor , and Samoa Joe for the Intercontinental Championship . At WrestleMania 34 , The Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Rollins , thus making Rollins the defending champion . Both Miz and Joe were traded to SmackDown while Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw . </P> <P> On March 26 , Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz ( Jeff and Matt Hardy ) . At WrestleMania 34 , however , Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to Braun Strowman and 10 - year - old Nicholas . The following night on Raw , Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas being a fourth grader . Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back , but Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four - team Tag Team Eliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble . `` Woken '' Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt won the tournament by defeating Titus Worldwide ( Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil ) and The Revival ( Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson ) . Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during the Superstar Shake - up . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , The Bludgeon Brothers ( Harper and Rowan ) defeated The Usos ( Jey and Jimmy Uso ) and The New Day 's Big E and Kofi Kingston in a triple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship . On the following SmackDown , The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title match at Greatest Royal Rumble . </P> <P> A match between John Cena and Triple H was scheduled on March 26 . </P> <P> The Undertaker , was originally scheduled to face Rusev in a casket match , the first match of its kind in three years . Due to reasons not entirely clear , Rusev was temporarily replaced by Chris Jericho -- this was explained with Rusev 's wife Lana complaining about her husband competing in a casket match -- but eventually reinserted back into the match . Jericho was restored to his original participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , Jinder Mahal defeated Randy Orton , Bobby Roode , and Rusev in a fatal - four way match to win the United States Championship . Mahal was then traded to Raw and lost the championship to Jeff Hardy and Mahal invoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble . Hardy was then traded to SmackDown the following night . </P> <P> At WrestleMania 34 , AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura . After the match , showed his respect to Styles but then attacked him with a low blow and a Kinshasa , turning heel . On April 17 , after repeated attacks on Styles by Nakamura , a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble . </P> <P> On the WrestleMania 34 pre-show , Cedric Alexander defeated Mustafa Ali in the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament final to win the vacant title . Two nights later on 205 Live , Buddy Murphy attacked the new champion during his celebration . Murphy was then scheduled to face Alexander for the title at the Greatest Royal Rumble , but he failed his mandatory weigh - in when he weighed 207 pounds , 2 pounds over the 205 pound weight limit . He was then removed from the match and banned from competing on 205 Live until he met the weight requirement . The following week , Kalisto earned a Cruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a gauntlet match . </P> <H2> Event ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Preliminary matches ( edit ) </H3> <Table> Other on - screen personnel <Tr> <Th> Role : </Th> <Th> Name : </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> English commentators </Td> <Td> Michael Cole </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Corey Graves </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Byron Saxton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Spanish commentators </Td> <Td> Carlos Cabrera </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Marcelo Rodríguez </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Arabic commentators </Td> <Td> Faisal Almughaisib </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sultan Alharbi </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jude Aldajani </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ring announcer </Td> <Td> Greg Hamilton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Referees </Td> <Td> Danilo Anfibio </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jason Ayers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> John Cone </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Engler </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Darrick Moore </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Chad Patton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ryan Tran </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Interviewer </Td> <Td> Mike Rome </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Pre-show panel </Td> <Td> Byron Saxton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jerry Lawler </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jim Ross </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Booker T </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The actual pay - per - view opened with John Cena facing Triple H. During the match , after trading finishers , and reversing each other 's finishers , Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Triple H , a springboard into the corner turnbuckle , followed and another Attitude Adjustment to pick up the victory . Following the match Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality , and expressed excitement over the event . </P> <P> In the following match , Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto . The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title . </P> <P> Next , the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions , Cesaro and Sheamus . In the end , Hardy distracted Sheamus , allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him . Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the title . </P> <P> Jeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal . In the end , Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title . </P> <P> After that , The Bludgeons Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained their titles after performing a Double Crucifix Powerbomb on Jimmy Uso . </P> <P> Next , Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor , Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match . Near the end of the match , Finn Balor climbed the ladder to unhook the championship , only for Rollins to leap from the top rope onto the ladder and managed to retrieve the title belt before Balor , thus retaining his championship . </P> <P> Later , AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura . During the match , Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics , such as a Low Blow , increasingly frustrating Styles . In the end , both Nakamura and Styles brawled outside of the ring only for the match to end in a double countout . Post-match Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm over the top rope on Nakamura . </P> <P> After that , The Undertaker fought Rusev ( who was accompanied by Aiden English ) in a Casket match . At the end of the match , Undertaker performed a Chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket . Before he could close the lid , English attacked the Undertaker , who retailiated with another Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory . </P> <P> In the penultimate match , Brock Lesnar ( accompanied by Paul Heyman ) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match . Lesnar delivered multiple German Suplexes during the match , and both men kicked out of each other 's finishing moves . At one point in the match , Reigns tried to escape the cage through the door only for Heyman to slam the door on Reigns . The match ended after Reigns put Lesnar through the cage wall with a Spear , sending it onto the floor . Despite Reigns touching the floor with both feet first , the referee awarded the win to Lesnar , thereby retaining the Universal Championship . </P> <H3> Main event ( edit ) </H3> <P> Daniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler began the 50 - man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants . Bryan survived until the final 3 , beating out Rey Mysterio for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes . At the end of the match , Big Cass eliminated Bryan only for Cass to then attempt a Big Boot on Braun Strowman , who ducked and knocked Cass over the top rope to win the match . Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13 , beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12 . Post-match , Strowman received a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship . </P> <H2> Controversy ( edit ) </H2> See also : Women in WWE <P> WWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers , who were unable to perform at the event due to the limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia . Triple H , WWE 's Executive Vice President of Talent , Live Events and Creative , responded to the criticism : `` I understand that people are questioning it , but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you do n't agree with a certain aspect of it , it does n't mean it 's not a relevant culture ... You ca n't dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but , having said that , WWE is at the forefront of a women 's evolution in the world and what you ca n't do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it ... While women are not competing in the event , we have had discussions about that and hope that , in the next few years they will be '' . Women were in attendance for the event , though only if accompanied by a male guardian . This was a major change from previous events , which were only open to men . Associated Press noted that this is due to `` a series of social changes '' by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman . During the event , WWE aired a promotional video , which included WWE female wrestlers . The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for `` indecent material '' that aired at the event . </P> <P> In addition to the women , wrestler Sami Zayn did not participate in the event as Zayn is of Syrian descent , and Saudi Arabia has strained relations with Syria . </P> <P> Another subject of criticism was the situation of LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia , as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death . </P> <H2> Results ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Results </Th> <Th> Stipulations </Th> <Th> Times </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th>

professional wrestling championship created and promoted by American professional wrestling promotion WWE and sanctioned by the Saudi General Sports Authority . The current and inaugural champion is Braun Strowman , who was awarded the championship for winning the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match at the namesake event . </P> <H3> History ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 5 , 2018 , WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble , a live event to be held on April 27 , 2018 , at King Abdullah International Stadium , part of the King Abdullah Sports City , in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . The event was part of a 10 - year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030 , Saudi Arabia 's social and economic reform program . The Greatest Royal Rumble Championship was unveiled by WWE on April 27 , 2018 during the Greatest Royal Rumble event . The championship was announced on the official website of the Saudi General Sports Authority as the Belt Kingdom Championship . Braun Strowman , the 41st entrant of the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match , became the inaugural Greatest Royal Rumble Champion by lastly eliminating Big Cass . </P> <H3> Championship belt design ( edit ) </H3> <P> As with some other championship belts unveiled in 2016 , the base design is similar to the WWE Championship , with notable differences . Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo , the center plate is modeled with Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center . Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016 and 2017 , the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt features two side plates , both separated by gold divider bars , with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion 's logo ; the default plates feature the official logo of Saudi General Sports Authority which is identical to the national emblem of Saudi Arabia . The plates are on a green leather strap resembling the color of the national flag of Saudi Arabia . </P> <H3> Reigns ( edit ) </H3> <P> As of May 28 , 2018 , there has been one reign , which is the inaugural and current champion , Braun Strowman . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Champion </Th> <Th> Reign </Th> <Th> Date </Th> <Th> Days held </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> Event </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> Strowman , Braun Braun Strowman </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> April 27 , 2018 </Td> <Td> 7001310000000000000 ♠ 31 + </Td> <Td> Jeddah , Saudi Arabia </Td> <Td> Greatest Royal Rumble </Td> <Td> Became the inaugural champion by winning the 50 - man Greatest Royal Rumble match </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Let 's rumble like never before . `` When Legends Rise '' by @ godsmack is an # OfficialThemeSong for the Greatest Royal Rumble event . # WWEGRR `` .
