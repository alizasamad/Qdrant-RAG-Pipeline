The producers of the show select the cases . To acquire cases , the show solicits real - life litigants with pending disputes or individuals with potential disputes . If litigants agree to be on the show , they are paid a talent fee ranging from $150 to $300 , and they receive travel accommodations . Mathis does have prior knowledge of the cases . In all cases , litigants give their prospective case managers all evidence in advance . Any real legal case pending must be dismissed by both parties . Typically , Mathis 's producers only seek cases that they deem `` juicy '' enough for TV . Occasionally , Mathis leaves the courtroom to deliberate and then returns with his verdict . Upon final judgment , he may briefly explain the legal principle guiding his verdict , especially if his ruling is based on a particular state 's law . Reportedly , Mathis ' rulings conform to the laws of the state where the case was originally filed . </P> <H2> Incorporation of life story into court show ( edit ) </H2> <P> As a child and a teenager , Mathis was frequently in legal trouble . He was a member of a street gang in Detroit , and he was arrested and sentenced to jail for illegally carrying a firearm when he was 17 years old . </P> <P> Mathis has frequently used his courtroom series to highlight his troubled - youth - turned - success - story as a way of motivating and inspiring his audience ( especially youth audience ) that there 's no adversity that they ca n't pick themselves up from . It is from his background where Mathis derives much of his courtroom formula . For example , his show 's opening theme was formerly a brief documentary of his powerful life story . As another example , he takes a liking to litigants who 've seen the error of their ways and have made efforts to improve and better their lives . </P> <H2> Judge gregory Mathis 's adjudicating approach ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Greg Mathis <P> Mathis typically begins proceedings by having litigants expound on their side of the dispute , so as to gain insight into the matter . Cases on Judge Mathis tend to go deeper and to more revealing places than those of most other court shows . He also calls attention to peculiarities or juicy details exposed throughout the course of the proceedings as a means of making the cases more interesting to viewers . Furthermore , Mathis does n't hesitate to tackle any social issues that emerge during the proceedings , tying his social justice perspectives to the cases . </P> <P> While hearing the testimonies , Mathis takes on a relaxed , attentive , understanding and open - minded nature . Rarely missing an opportunity to jest or poke fun , Mathis is given to fun , humor , good - natured ridicule and gibes , often rousing his audience to uproarious amusement . He sometimes cuts the tension -- even tension he himself has fostered -- with wisecracks or taunting remarks . Mathis has bantered directly at audience members on occasion , also resulting in audience amusement . He uses a rather high - pitched voice as part of stultifying litigants and suggesting that they 've not recognized the obvious . </P> <P> Combined with his teasing and comedic tendencies on the bench , Mathis is known for his street smart , urban expressions and stern side as well . In moments in which Mathis has found a litigant guilty of a particularly reprehensible act , he takes on a very resentful nature along with lecturing and shaming behaviors . Sometimes in these moments , Mathis makes a point of solemnizing his courtroom due to prior laughs and lightheartedness , letting litigants and everyone on hand know that things are no longer a laughing matter and that he 's to be taken seriously . </P> <P> The final portion of most of the cases generally see Mathis displaying a harshly corrective side , providing an explanation behind the direction of his verdict in the form of a sharp tirade , unbroken in delivery so as not to allow anyone a word in edgewise before his gavel pound and exit . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Judge Mathis Bio '' .
