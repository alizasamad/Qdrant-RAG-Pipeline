The book tells a Christmas - themed story , written in rhyme , that explains how Santa Claus knows who is naughty and who is nice . It describes elves visiting children between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve , after which they return to the North Pole until the next holiday season . The Elf on the Shelf comes in a keepsake box that features a hardbound picture book and a small soft toy in the form of a pixie scout elf . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Mensch on a Bench </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Criticism </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> This story describes how Santa 's `` scout elves '' hide in people 's homes to watch over events . Once everyone goes to bed , the scout elf flies back to the North Pole to report to Santa the activities , good and bad , that have taken place throughout the day . Before the family wakes up each morning , the scout elf flies back from the North Pole and hides . By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house , the scout elf plays an ongoing game of hide and seek with the family . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf explains that scout elves get their magic by being named and being loved by a child . In the back of each book , families have an opportunity to write their elf 's name and the date that they adopted it . Once the elf is named , the scout elf receives its special Christmas magic , which allows it to fly to and from the North Pole . </P> <P> The book tells how the magic might disappear if the scout elf is touched , so the rule for The Elf on the Shelf states , `` There 's only one rule that you have to follow , so I will come back and be here tomorrow : Please do not touch me . My magic might go , and Santa wo n't hear all I 've seen or I know . '' Although families are told not to touch their scout elf , they can speak to it and tell it all their Christmas wishes so that it can report back to Santa accurately . </P> <P> The story ends on Christmas Day with the elf leaving to stay with Santa for the rest of the year until the following Christmas season . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Elf on the Shelf was written in 2004 by Carol Aebersold and daughter Chanda Bell over a cup of tea . Bell suggested they write a book about an old tradition of an elf sent from Santa who came to watch over them at Christmas time . Aebersold 's other daughter , Christa Pitts , was recruited by the family to share her expertise in sales and marketing . Together , the trio devoted the next three years promoting their self - published book and attending book signings and trade shows . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf won the Best Toy Award by Learning Express , won Book of the Year Award from Creative Child Awards and National Best Books Award sponsored by USA Book News in 2008 . In 2012 , The Elf on the Shelf made its first appearance in the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade alongside fellow parade newcomers Hello Kitty and Papa Smurf . In 2013 , The Elf on the Shelf hit the # 1 spot on the USA Today Bestsellers List . </P> <P> On 26 November 2011 , the book aired on CBS as a 30 - minute animated TV show , An Elf 's Story : The Elf on the Shelf , directed by Chad Eikhoff . The Washington Post criticized the quality of the animation and dismissed it as `` just a half - hour advertisement for a book and a toy '' , which it felt would not join `` the canon of prime - time animated Christmas specials that actually move the spirit '' . Common Sense Media disagreed , calling the special `` a great addition to families ' holiday TV traditions '' ; however , they also warn parents about the consumer - driven nature of the story , and make note of its lack of educational value . </P> <P> In October 2013 , The Elf on the Shelf : A Birthday Tradition was released . Written and illustrated by the same team that created the first book , it offers instructions for inviting a scout elf to visit for a child 's birthday party and describes how the elf decorates a chair for the child . In April 2014 , two supplemental birthday products were released : The Elf on the Shelf Birthday Countdown Game and The Elf on the Shelf Birthday Chair Decoration Kit . </P> <P> The Elf on the Shelf was parodied as `` The Gnome in the Home '' in `` The Nightmare After Krustmas , '' a 2016 episode of The Simpsons . </P> <H3> Mensch on a Bench ( edit ) </H3> <P> A Jewish counterpart to Elf On The Shelf was created : `` Mensch on a Bench , '' a stuffed toy that looks a bit like a rabbi or a Hasidic Jew . Jewish father Neal Hoffman , a former Hasbro Toys toy marketing executive , raised more than $20,000 , using the crowdfunding website Kickstarter to fund creation of the toy in the Spring of 2011 . `` Mensch '' , in Yiddish , means a person of integrity or honor . </P> <P> Cody Decker , the starting left fielder for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic , brought the team 's mascot , a five - foot version of `` Mensch on a Bench , '' with him to Asia from the United States for the World Baseball Classic . Decker said he `` tried getting him a first - class ticket . But that did n't fly , so he was put in a duffel bag and checked . '' The mascot proved to be a big hit . He has his own locker , sits on Team Israel 's bench in the dugout during every game , and sat alongside Decker at a press conference in South Korea . Decker said : </P> <P> `` He 's a mascot , he 's a friend , he 's a teammate , he 's a borderline deity to our team ... He brings a lot to the table ... Every team needs their Jobu . He was ours . He had his own locker , and we even gave him offerings : Manischewitz , gelt , and gefilte fish ... He is everywhere and nowhere all at once . His actual location is irrelevant because he exists in higher metaphysical planes . But he 's always near . '' </P> <P> Team Israel Manager Jerry Weinstein said : `` He 's on the team . Everybody brings something to the team , and certainly The Mensch is a unifying factor for the ball club . '' Pitcher Gabe Cramer said : `` The Mensch on a Bench is ... a symbol we can rally around as a team . We are proud to be Jewish , but we know how to make and take a joke , something Jews have a long history of doing . The Mensch is a great way to have fun in the dugout while reminding us of why we 're here and who we 're representing . '' </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Elf has received some criticism from cultural reviewers . The Atlantic columnist Kate Tuttle calls it `` a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a tradition '' whose purpose is `` to spy on kids '' and that one should n't `` bully your child into thinking that good behavior equals gifts . '' Washington Post reviewer Hank Stuever characterized the concept as `` just another nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes '' . Writing for Psychology Today , Dr. David Kyle Johnston calls it a `` dangerous parental crutch '' , with much the same reasoning as what he terms the `` Santa lie '' . Professor Laura Pinto suggests that it conditions kids to accept the surveillance state and that it communicates to children that `` it 's okay for other people to spy on you , and you 're not entitled to privacy . '' She argues that `` if you grow up thinking it 's cool for the elves to watch me and report back to Santa , well , then it 's cool for the NSA to watch me and report back to the government ... The rule of play is that kids get to interact with a doll or video game or what have you , but not so with the Elf on the Shelf : The rule is that you do n't touch the elf . Think about the message that sends . '' </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ ( 1 ) Archived April 15 , 2014 , at the Wayback Machine . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` An Elf 's Story '' .
