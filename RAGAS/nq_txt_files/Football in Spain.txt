Football is a widespread passion among the people of Spain . Football is the sport with the most registered players ( a total of 942,674 of which 898,551 are men and 44,123 women ) , and most registered clubs ( a total of 20,588 ) among all Spanish sport federations according to data issued by the sports administration of Spain 's government in 2016 . </P> <P> In a survey of sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010 , football was the second most popular recreational sport practised by the population ( 17.9 % ) . A total of 75.9 % of people said they had ever bought tickets to attend a football match . In addition , a total of 67.3 % of the people said that they saw all , almost all , many , or some of the football matches broadcast on television . In another survey made in 2014 , the practice of football decreased to 14 % of the population , being overtaken by other sports , such as running , cycling and swimming for recreation . However , in this survey football was still the sport that interests the majority of Spain 's people ( 48 % ) . A total of 67 % of the population said they were fans or had sympathy for a particular club . In addition , 74.9 % said they watched , whenever possible , the matches broadcast on television regarding their favorite teams ; and 42.4 % had , flags , badges or objects of their favorite teams . Data of this survey confirmed the widespread impression that most of Spain 's people are supporters of Real Madrid ( 37.9 % ) or FC Barcelona ( 25.4 % ) , and the other teams have fewer supporters nationwide , as Atlético de Madrid ( 16.1 % ) , Valencia CF ( 3.5 % ) , Athletic Bilbao ( 3.3 . ) or Sevilla FC ( 3.2 % ) . </P> <P> A relationship between football , politics , identity and attitudes towards regionalism in Spain has also been reported . </P> <P> The Royal Spanish Football Federation ( Spanish : Real Federación Española de Fútbol ) is the national governing body , and it organises two Cup competitions ( the Copa del Rey , and the Supercopa de España ) , and the Spain national football team . The Liga de Fútbol Profesional ( LFP ) ( English : Professional Football League ) , integrated by a total of 42 football clubs , forms part of the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) but has autonomy in its organisation and functioning . It is responsible for the organisation of state football leagues , in coordination with RFEF . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team have won the FIFA World Cup once , and has also been successful in the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic tournament . The biggest success achieved by the Spain national football team was the historic treble winning three tournaments in a row : UEFA European Championship in 2008 , FIFA World Cup in 2010 , and UEFA European Championship in 2012 . The men 's national teams of Spain , in all categories , have won a total of 26 titles in FIFA , UEFA , and Olympic tournaments . </P> <P> The First Division of the Liga de Fútbol Profesional , commonly known in the English - speaking world as La Liga , is one of the strongest football leagues in both Europe and the world . At club level , the Spanish football clubs have won a total of 66 international tournaments . They are the most successful in different current European competitions , such as UEFA Champions League , UEFA Super Cup ( shared ) , and UEFA Europa League ; and they also were the most successful in the extinct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup . </P> <P> The characteristic football style of play developed by FC Barcelona , and later by the Spanish national football team is Tiki - taka . This football style is characterised by possessing the ball for large portions of the game , moving the ball quickly from one player to the next , with short and quick passes , keeping the ball away from your opponent , and then to deliver that killer pass to score goal . </P> <P> Professional football in Spain is a sociocultural event that make a significant contribution to the Spanish economy in terms of both demand and supply . In economic terms , during 2013 professional football generated more than € 7.6 billion including direct , indirect and induced effects , representing 0.75 % of Spanish GPD . Moreover , as a result of financial crisis in the last years , many Spanish football clubs in the top two divisions have been facing serious economic troubles due to pay the bank debts . In addition , the European Union authorities have warned to Spanish authorities in order to halt public funding of debt - ridden clubs . </P> <P> Spain national futsal team is one of the strongest teams in the world , being six times champion in the UEFA Futsal Championship , and two times champion in the FIFA Futsal World Championship . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Spanish national football team ( La Roja ) </Li> <Li> 3 Football club competitions </Li> <Li> 4 League ( La Liga ) </Li> <Li> 5 King 's Cup ( Copa del Rey ) </Li> <Li> 6 Spanish Supercup ( Supercopa de España ) </Li> <Li> 7 Spanish clubs in international competitions </Li> <Li> 8 Women 's football </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Modern football was introduced to Spain in the late 19th century by a combination of mostly British immigrant workers , visiting sailors and Spanish students coming from Britain . </P> <P> The oldest football clubs in Spain are Recreativo de Huelva and Sevilla FC . Although Gimnàstic de Tarragona was formed in 1886 , the club did not form an actual football team until 1914 . The first official football game played in Spain took place in Seville on 8 March 1890 at the Tablada Hippodrome . Sevilla FC played against Recreativo de Huelva . With the exception of two Spanish players on the Huelva team and another two players on the Seville team , all the players on both sides were British . Sevilla FC won 2 -- 0 . </P> <P> In the Basque Country during the early 1890s , British shipyard workers and miners formed the Bilbao Football Club and Basque students returning from Britain founded the Athletic Club in 1898 . This early British influence was reflected in the use of English names such as Recreation Club , Athletic Club and Football Club . </P> <P> In Catalonia , which had the most developed industry in Spain , there was an important British colony . The first games played by Britishmen and Catalan people who had studied in the United Kingdom were documented in 1882 in Barcelona . However , the first official and registered football club was Palamós FC ( Costa Brava , North of Catalonia ) in 1898 . The Swiss Hans Gamper founded FC Barcelona on 29 November 1899 . Other clubs were founded in 1900 , such as Sant Andreu , Hispania FC and the Sociedad Española de Football ( one year later the founders changed the name to Real Club Deportivo Español ) . The Catalan Football Federation ( Catalan : Federació Catalana de Futbol ) , responsible for administering football in Catalonia , was the first football association founded in Spain . It was formed on 11 November 1900 as the Football Association of Catalonia ( Catalan : Football Associació de Catalunya ) . The Catalan Football Federation organised the Catalan football championship ( Catalan : Campionat de Catalunya ) that was the first football competition in Spain . </P> <P> In Madrid , the first games were promoted by Institución Libre de Enseñanza ( ILE ) ( English : Free Educational Institution ) , an educational and cultural centre . The first club of Madrid was Football Club Sky , founded in 1897 , but the club separated into two new clubs in 1890 . Then , several clubs also emerged in Madrid , most notably Madrid Football Club , founded in 1902 by Catalan brothers Juan and Carlos Padrós . </P> <P> The Copa del Rey ( English : King 's Cup ) competition was founded in 1903 , one year after a previous football tournament named Coronation Cup . It was Spain 's football national Championship from 1903 until the establishment of the League Championship in 1928 . </P> <P> The Spanish Federation of Football Clubs was formed in 1909 , but there were discrepancies between the member clubs years later , and some of the clubs formed other association called Royal Spanish Union of Clubs of Football . Finally , the two associations reached an agreement and the Royal Spanish Football Federation was founded in 1913 , which allowed the Spanish football to enter in FIFA . In these years , Athletic was the most dominant club in the country , and the first idols in Spain began to appear , like Pichichi and Paulino Alcántara . </P> <P> The Spain national team was created in 1920 on the occasion of the dispute of the Olympic Games in Antwerp . The importance of the success of the Spain national team in the Olympic games , which won the silver medal , was huge in the development of football as mass social event in Spain . The interest on football grew , more people attended to the stadiums , more informations about football appeared in the newspapers , and football was used as element of national prestige and political propaganda . </P> <P> After the Olympic triumph , football was more popular among Spanish fans , the attendances to the stadiums increased , and the pressure of professionalism grew . Spanish football turned professional in 1925 . An agreement between several clubs was made on 23 November 1928 which officially established Spain 's national football division , and the birth of the Spanish League . The first league championship began in 1929 . </P> <P> The Spanish Civil War ( 1936 -- 1939 ) brought disruption to the national competitions . Although the Spanish League was suspended , the Catalan and Valencian clubs continued contesting in the Mediterranean League in early 1937 . Barcelona later toured Mexico and the United States , raising support for the Spanish Republic . </P> <P> The Spanish League and the Cup were restored in the 1939 -- 40 season after Civil War had ended . Francisco Franco 's regime , a fascist political system , began to use football as a propaganda tool for the new regime . In 1941 , as part of his policy of eradicating regional identities , the Franco 's regime banned the use of non-Castilian names . As a result , many clubs that had chosen English prefixes previously , such as Athletic or Football club , had to amend their initial names , for other Castilian ( as Atlético , or Club de Fútbol ) . The Catalan Championship was banned and the Catalan shield taken from FC Barcelona 's badge . Spanish football began to rebuild slowly after the War , but Spain 's isolated international position meant they did not properly re-enter International football until 1950 . Later , Franco 's regime was able to use the football , based on the European triumphs of Real Madrid in the 1950s for political purposes . In this manner , Real Madrid was used as a Spanish brand of success to promote Spain 's image abroad , as well as the pride of being Spanish in the country itself . </P> <P> Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup . </P> <P> Until the 1984 -- 85 season , the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) was responsible for organizing the league tournament . Since then , the competition was organized by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional ( LFP ) ( English : Professional Football League ) , an independent body which was formed at the initiative of the clubs themselves after disagreements with the RFEF regarding the management professionalization and economic division of the League benefits . </P> <P> Since the entry into force of Spanish Law 10 / 1990 , almost all of the clubs competing professionally in Spain are actually companies under the legal status of sports companies , whose ownership is in the hands of its shareholders . Only three professional clubs ( Athletic Club , Barcelona and Real Madrid ) kept its original structure , such as sports clubs directly controlled by their members . </P> <P> After the appearance of private television in Spain , football clubs hugely increased its income thanks to the lucrative contracts to broadcast matches on television . This allowed them to hire many of the best players in the world , but most of the clubs also increased vastly their spending . In the last years La Liga is living in a big financial turmoil . Although the two big powerful clubs , Real Madrid and Barcelona , are at the top in Forbes ' football rich list , the rest of Spanish clubs are weighed down by a colossal debt around € 4.1 billion . For this reason , most of the clubs had to cut their budgets drastically . </P> <H2> Spanish national football team ( La Roja ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Spain national football team Main article : List of Spain international footballers <P> Within Spain , regional teams , most notably the football team of Catalonia , the football team of Basque Country , and even the football team of Galicia , began to compete against each other from 1915 onwards . Despite not being officially recognised by FIFA , these regional teams still occasionally play friendly games with some national team players playing for both teams . Some autonomous governments and social sectors in the historical communities ( especially in Catalonia and Basque Country ) prefer to call their regional teams as national team , while claiming to participate in international tournaments . </P> <P> The Spain national team , commonly referred to as La selección ( English : The selection ) or La Roja ( English : The Red one ) , made their international debut at the 1920 Olympic Games in Belgium and came away with the silver medal . Since then the Spanish national team has participated in a total of fourteen out twenty FIFA World Cup and nine out fourteen UEFA European Championship . Historically , the Spanish national team did not achieve important results , in terms of trophies or develop an attractive playing style . Surprisingly , this fact contrasted with the huge success obtained by the main Spanish football clubs at the European level . Nevertheless , the triumphs of Spanish national team in 2008 and 2012 European Championship , and in 2010 FIFA World Cup , with an attractive playing style , marked a point of inflection that divided the history of Spanish national football team in two parts . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team has been the winner of FIFA Team of Year in 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , as well as the winner of Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2011 . </P> <P> The Spanish national football team have won four trophies in FIFA and UEFA tournaments : one FIFA World Cup in 2010 , and three UEFA European Championship in 1964 , 2008 and 2012 . In addition , it was runner - up in the UEFA European Championship in 1984 and in the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 . </P> <P> The Spain national under - 23 team won the gold medal in 1992 Olympic tournament and the silver medal in 2000 . </P> <P> The Spain national football team won the gold medal at the Mediterranean Games in 2005 and 2007 , the silver medal in 1955 , and the bronze medal in 1963 and 1967 . </P> <P> In addition , the honours list includes numerous titles at junior level teams : </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 21 Championship in 1986 , 1998 , 2011 , and 2013 . </P> <P> FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1999 . </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 19 Championship ( formerly Under - 18 ) in 1995 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2011 2012 and 2015 . </P> <P> UEFA European Under - 17 Championship ( formerly Under - 16 ) in 1986 , 1988 , 1991 , 1997 , 1999 , 2001 , 2007 and 2008 . </P> <P> 1999 Meridian Cup . </P> <P> Spain have won the Maurice Burlaz Trophy , the prize awarded to the national association that has achieved the best results in UEFA 's men 's youth competitions ( UEFA European Under - 19 Championship and UEFA European Under - 17 championship ) over the previous two seasons , in 1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , and 2011 . </P> <P> A short list of some of the top Spanish football players ( grouped by playing positions and era ) which have ever played for the Spanish national team include : </P> <P> Goalkeepers : Ricardo Zamora ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Antoni Ramallets ( 1940s / 1960s ) , José Ángel Iribar ( 1960s / 1980s ) , Luis Arconada ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Andoni Zubizarreta ( 1970s / 1990s ) , Iker Casillas ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Víctor Valdés ( 2000s / 2010s ) , David de Gea ( 2010s ) </P> <P> Defenders : Jacinto Quincoces ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Joan Segarra ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Jesús Garay ( 1950s / 1960s ) , José Santamaría ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Feliciano Rivilla ( 1960s ) , José Antonio Camacho ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Antonio Maceda ( 1980s ) , Rafael Gordillo ( 1970s / 1990s ) , Miguel Ángel Nadal ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Fernando Hierro ( 1980s / 2000s ) , Abelardo Fernández ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Carles Puyol ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Sergio Ramos ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Gerard Piqué ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Jordi Alba ( 2010s ) </P> <P> Midfielders : Josep Samitier ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Martín Marculeta ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Leonardo Cilaurren ( 1920s / 1930s ) , José Luis Panizo ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Antonio Puchades ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Alfredo Di Stéfano ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Luis del Sol ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Luis Suárez ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Luis Aragonés ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Jesús María Pereda ( 1960s ) , Pirri ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Jesús María Zamora ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Míchel ( 1980s / 1990s ) , José Luis Pérez Caminero ( 1990s ) , Luis Enrique ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Pep Guardiola ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Julen Guerrero ( 1990s ) , Gaizka Mendieta ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Xavi ( 1990s / 2010s ) , Xabi Alonso ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Andrés Iniesta ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Santi Cazorla ( 2000s / 2010s ) , David Silva ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Cesc Fàbregas ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Juan Mata ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Sergio Busquets ( 2000s / 2010s ) </P> <P> Forwards : Pichichi ( 1910s / 20s ) , Paulino Alcántara ( 1910s / 1920s ) , Luis Regueiro ( 1920s / 1930s ) , Isidro Lángara ( 1930s ) , César ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Telmo Zarra ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Agustín Gaínza ( 1940s / 1950s ) , Estanislau Basora ( 1940s / 1950s ) , László Kubala ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Ferenc Puskás ( 1960s ) , Francisco Gento ( 1950s / 1960s ) , Amancio Amaro ( 1960s / 1970s ) , Santillana ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Juanito ( 1970s / 1980s , Quini ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Roberto López Ufarte ( 1970s / 1980s ) , Emilio Butragueño ( 1980s / 1990s ) , Julio Salinas ( 1980s / 1990s ) , Raúl ( 1990s / 2000s ) , Fernando Morientes ( 1990s / 2000s ) , David Villa ( 2000s / 2010s ) , Fernando Torres ( 2000s / 2010s ) </P> <H2> Football Club competitions ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of football clubs in Spain Main article : Football records in Spain <P> Currently , the three most important competitions between clubs in Spain are La Liga ( English : League ) , the Copa del Rey ( English : King 's Cup ) and the Supercopa de España ( English : Spanish Supercup ) .
