Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 , and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818 , when she was 20 . Her name first appeared on the second edition , published in France in 1823 . </P> <P> Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814 , journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) away from Frankenstein Castle , where , two centuries before , an alchemist was engaged in experiments . Later , she travelled in the region of Geneva ( Switzerland ) -- where much of the story takes place -- and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions , particularly her lover and future husband , Percy Shelley . Mary , Percy , Lord Byron and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story . After thinking for days , Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made ; her dream later evolved into the novel 's story . </P> <P> Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement . At the same time , it is an early example of science fiction . Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because , in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction , the central character `` makes a deliberate decision '' and `` turns to modern experiments in the laboratory '' to achieve fantastic results . It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories , films and plays . </P> <P> Since the novel 's publication , the name `` Frankenstein '' has often been used to refer to the monster itself . This usage is sometimes considered erroneous , but usage commentators regard it as well - established and acceptable . In the novel , the monster is identified by words such as `` creature '' , `` monster '' , `` demon '' , `` wretch '' , `` abortion '' , `` fiend '' and `` it '' . Speaking to Victor Frankenstein , the wretch refers to himself as `` the Adam of your labours '' , and elsewhere as someone who `` would have ( been ) your Adam '' , but is instead `` your fallen angel '' ( which ties to Lucifer in Paradise Lost , which the monster reads , and which relates to the disobedience of Prometheus in the book 's subtitle ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Summary <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Captain Walton 's Introductory Frame Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.2 Victor Frankenstein 's Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.3 The Creature 's Narrative </Li> <Li> 1.4 Victor Frankenstein 's Narrative Resumes </Li> <Li> 1.5 Captain Walton 's Concluding Frame Narrative </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Characters </Li> <Li> 3 Composition </Li> <Li> 4 Publication </Li> <Li> 5 Frankenstein and the Monster <Ul> <Li> 5.1 The Creature </Li> <Li> 5.2 Victor Frankenstein 's Surname </Li> <Li> 5.3 Victor Frankenstein 's Given Name </Li> <Li> 5.4 Modern Prometheus </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Shelley 's sources </Li> <Li> 7 Reception </Li> <Li> 8 Derivative works </Li> <Li> 9 Films , plays and television </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 Notes </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 Further reading <Ul> <Li> 13.1 Editions <Ul> <Li> 13.1. 1 1818 text </Li> <Li> 13.1. 2 1831 text </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Summary </H2> A variety of different editions <P> Frankenstein is written in the form of a frame story that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister . It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century , as the letters ' dates are given as `` 17 -- '' . </P> <H3> Captain Walton 's introductory frame narrative </H3> <P> The novel Frankenstein is written in epistolary form , documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister , Margaret Walton Saville . Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame . During the voyage , the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure . A few hours later , the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein . Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton 's crew . Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion ; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him , and recounts a story of his life 's miseries to Walton as a warning . The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein 's narrative . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's narrative </H3> <P> Victor begins by telling of his childhood . Born in Naples , into a wealthy Genevan family , Victor and his brothers , Ernest and William , all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort , are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry . As a young boy , Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders . When Victor is five years old , his parents adopt Elizabeth Lavenza , the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman , with whom Victor later falls in love . During this period , Victor 's parents , Alphonse and Caroline , take in yet another orphan , Justine Moritz , who becomes William 's nanny . </P> <P> Weeks before he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany , his mother dies of scarlet fever ; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief . At the university , he excels at chemistry and other sciences , soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter . Eventually , he undertakes the creation of a humanoid , but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body , Victor makes the Creature tall , about 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) in height and proportionally large . Despite his intentions , the beautiful creation of his dreams is instead hideous , with yellow eyes and skin that barely conceals the muscle tissue and blood vessels underneath . Repulsed by his work , Victor flees and dismisses him when it awakens . While wandering the streets , he meets his childhood friend , Henry Clerval , and takes Henry back to his apartment , fearful of Henry 's reaction if he sees the monster . Victor does not have to deal with that issue , however , because the monster has escaped . </P> <P> Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry . After a four - month recovery , he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William . Upon arriving in Geneva , Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain , leading him to believe his creation is responsible . Justine Moritz , William 's nanny , is convicted of the crime after William 's locket , which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline , is found in her pocket . Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged , as he knows no one would believe his story . </P> <P> Ravaged by grief and guilt , Victor retreats into the mountains . The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale . </P> <H3> The Creature 's narrative </H3> <P> Intelligent and articulate , the Creature relates his first days of life , living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance , which led him to fear and hide from them . While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage , he grew fond of the poor family living there , and discreetly collected firewood for them . Secretly living among the family for months , the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods . When he saw his reflection in a pool , he realized his physical appearance was hideous , and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans . Nevertheless , he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend . Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family , but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home , resulting in the Creature burning the cottage in a fit of rage . He then swore revenge on his creator for bringing him into a world that hated him . He traveled to Victor 's family estate using details from Victor 's journal , murdered William , and framed Justine . </P> <P> The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself . He argues that as a living being , he has a right to happiness . The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness , never to reappear , if Victor grants his request . Should Victor refuse his request , The Creature also threatens to kill Victor 's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him . </P> <P> Fearing for his family , Victor reluctantly agrees . The Creature says he will watch over Victor 's progress . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's narrative resumes </H3> <P> Clerval accompanies him to England , but they separate at Victor 's insistence at Perth , Scotland . Victor suspects that the Creature is following him . Working on the female creature on the Orkney Islands , he is plagued by premonitions of disaster , such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him , but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind . He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature , who had indeed followed Victor , watching through a window . The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again , but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well , and the pair would threaten all humanity . Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will `` be with ( him ) on ( his ) wedding night '' . Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life , believing that the Creature will kill him after finally becoming happy . When Victor lands in Ireland , he is soon imprisoned for Clerval 's murder , as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived , causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison . After being acquitted , Victor returns home with his father , who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father 's fortune . </P> <P> In Geneva , Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death , arming himself with pistols and a dagger . The night following their wedding , Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for `` the fiend '' . While Victor searches the house and grounds , the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death . From the window , Victor sees the Creature , who tauntingly points at Elizabeth 's corpse ; Victor tries to shoot him , but the Creature escapes . After getting back to Geneva , Victor 's father , weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth , dies a few days later . Seeking revenge , Victor pursues the Creature to the North Pole , but collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry . </P> <H3> Captain Walton 's concluding frame narrative </H3> <P> At the end of Victor 's narrative , Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story , closing the frame around Victor 's recounting . A few days after the Creature vanished , the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and multiple crewmen die in the cold , before the rest of Walton 's crew insists on returning south once it is freed . Walton sees Victor 's story as a warning , and decides to turn the ship around . </P> <P> Victor dies shortly thereafter , but not before telling Walton to `` avoid ambition '' . Walton discovers the Creature on his ship , mourning over Victor 's body . The Creature tells Walton that Victor 's death has not brought him peace ; rather , his crimes have left him completely alone . The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence . Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon lost in darkness and distance , never to be seen again . </P> <H2> Characters </H2> <Ul> <Li> Victor Frankenstein - Protagonist and narrator of most of the story .

'' ) <P> `` How I , then a young girl , came to think of , and to dilate upon , so very hideous an idea ? '' -- Mary Shelley </P> <P> During the rainy summer of 1816 , the `` Year Without a Summer '' , the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 . Mary Shelley , aged 18 , and her lover ( and later husband ) Percy Bysshe Shelley , visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in Switzerland . The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned , so the group retired indoors until dawn . </P> <P> Sitting around a log fire at Byron 's villa , the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana , then Byron proposed that they `` each write a ghost story '' . Unable to think of a story , young Mary became anxious : `` Have you thought of a story ? I was asked each morning , and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative . '' During one evening in the middle of summer , the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life . `` Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated '' , Mary noted , `` galvanism had given token of such things '' . It was after midnight before they retired , and unable to sleep , she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her `` waking dream '' . </P> <P> I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together . I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out , and then , on the working of some powerful engine , show signs of life , and stir with an uneasy , half vital motion . Frightful must it be ; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world . </P> <P> In September 2011 , astronomer Donald Olson , after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year , and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars , concluded that her `` waking dream '' took place `` between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. '' on 16 June 1816 , several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story . </P> <P> She began writing what she assumed would be a short story . With Percy Shelley 's encouragement , she expanded the tale into a full - fledged novel . She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment `` when I first stepped out from childhood into life '' . Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half - sister Fanny . This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley 's work . Shelley 's first child died in infancy , and when she began composing Frankenstein in 1816 , she was likely nursing her second child , who would also be dead at Frankenstein 's publication . </P> <P> Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans , and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre ( 1819 ) , the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre . Thus two legendary horror tales originated from the conclave . </P> <P> The group talked about Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment ideas as well . Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly ; however , she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society ( Bennett 36 -- 42 ) . </P> <P> Mary 's and Percy Bysshe Shelley 's manuscripts for the first three - volume edition in 1818 ( written 1816 -- 1817 ) , as well as Mary Shelley 's fair copy for her publisher , are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford . The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004 , and they belong now to the Abinger Collection . In 2008 , the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein , edited by Charles E. Robinson , that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley 's original text with Percy Shelley 's additions and interventions alongside . </P> <H2> Publication </H2> Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell ( 1840 -- 41 ) <P> Shelley completed her writing in April / May 1817 , and Frankenstein ; or , The Modern Prometheus was published on 1 January 1818 by the small London publishing house Lackington , Hughes , Harding , Mavor , & Jones . It was issued anonymously , with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin , her father . It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes , the standard `` triple - decker '' format for 19th - century first editions . </P> <P> The second edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1822 in two volumes ( by G. and W.B. Whittaker ) following the success of the stage play Presumption ; or , the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake . This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book 's author on its title page . </P> <P> On 31 October 1831 , the first `` popular '' edition in one - volume appeared , published by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley . This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley , partially to make the story less radical . It included a lengthy new preface by the author , presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story . This edition is the one most widely published and read now , although a few editions follow the 1818 text . Some scholars prefer the original version , arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley 's vision ( see Anne K. Mellor 's `` Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach '' in the W.W. Norton Critical edition ) . </P> <P> In 2008 , a new edition of the novel , titled The Original Frankenstein , edited by Charles E. Robinson , was published . Robinson examined the original manuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made to it . </P> <H2> Frankenstein and the monster </H2> <H3> The Creature </H3> Main article : Frankenstein 's monster An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish Fenian movement as akin to Frankenstein 's creature , in the wake of the Phoenix Park murders . Illustration from an 1882 issue of Punch <P> Part of Frankenstein 's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name , which causes a lack of identity . Instead it is referred to by words such as `` wretch '' , `` monster '' , `` creature '' , `` demon '' , `` devil '' , `` fiend '' , and `` it '' . When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10 , he addresses it as `` vile insect '' , `` abhorred monster '' , `` fiend '' , `` wretched devil '' , and `` abhorred devil '' . </P> <P> During a telling of Frankenstein , Shelley referred to the creature as `` Adam '' . Shelley was referring to the first man in the Garden of Eden , as in her epigraph : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Did I request thee , Maker , from my clay </Dd> <Dd> To mould Me man ? Did I solicit thee </Dd> <Dd> From darkness to promote me ? <Dl> <Dd> John Milton , Paradise Lost ( X . 743 -- 5 ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity , this description is not entirely consistent with Shelley 's work ; both the use of electricity and the cobbled - together image of Frankenstein 's monster were more the result of James Whale 's popular 1931 film adaptation of the story , and other early motion - picture works based upon the creature . In Shelley 's original work , Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life , and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter , though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous . After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power , Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature 's body ( one anatomical feature at a time , from raw materials supplied by `` the dissecting room and the slaughter - house '' ) , which he then brings to life using his unspecified process . </P> <P> The creature has often been mistakenly called `` Frankenstein '' . In 1908 one author said `` It is strange to note how well - nigh universally the term `` Frankenstein '' is misused , even by intelligent people , as describing some hideous monster `` . Edith Wharton 's The Reef ( 1916 ) describes an unruly child as an `` infant Frankenstein . '' David Lindsay 's `` The Bridal Ornament '' , published in The Rover , 12 June 1844 , mentioned `` the maker of poor Frankenstein . '' After the release of Whale 's cinematic Frankenstein , the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as `` Frankenstein '' . This also occurs in Frankenstein films , including Bride of Frankenstein ( 1935 ) and several subsequent films , as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein . Furthermore , future renditions and adaptations of the story include an evil laboratory assistant Igor or Ygor , who does not actually exist within the original narrative . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's surname </H3> <P> Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dream - vision . Despite her public claims of originality , however , a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley 's actual inspiration . The German name Frankenstein means `` stone of the Franks '' , and it is associated with various places in Germany , including Frankenstein Castle ( Burg Frankenstein ) in Darmstadt , Hesse , and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein , a town in the Palatinate . There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen , Thuringia , and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony . Until 1945 , Ząbkowice Śląskie , now a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship , Poland , was mainly populated by Germans and named Frankenstein in German , and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606 , which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author . Finally , the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia . </P> <P> Radu Florescu argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland . It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist , Conrad Dippel , had experimented with human bodies , and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality . A literary essay by A. J. Day supports Florescu 's position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel . Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley 's ' lost ' journals . According to Jörg Heléne , the ' lost journals ' , as well as Florescu 's claims , can not be verified . </P> <H3> Victor Frankenstein 's given name </H3> Main article : Victor Frankenstein <P> A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton , a great influence on Shelley ( a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein and Shelley even has the monster himself read it ) . Milton frequently refers to God as `` the Victor '' in Paradise Lost , and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life . In addition , Shelley 's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost ; indeed , the monster says , after reading the epic poem , that he empathizes with Satan 's role in the story . </P> <P> There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley , Mary 's husband . Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley 's , as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth , Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire . There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley 's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy , who at Eton had `` experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions '' , and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment . </P> <P> Percy Shelley was the first - born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley , 1st Baronet of Castle Goring , and Richard Fitzalan , 10th Earl of Arundel . Victor 's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics . Percy had a sister named Elizabeth ; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth . </P> <P> On 22 February 1815 , Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely , and the baby died two weeks later . Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire , Mary 's stepsister , for a lurid affair . When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment , though the newborn creature approached him , as a child would a parent . The question of Victor 's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book . </P> <H3> Modern Prometheus </H3> <P> The Modern Prometheus is the novel 's subtitle ( though some modern editions now drop the subtitle , mentioning it only in an introduction ) . Prometheus , in later versions of Greek mythology , was the Titan who created mankind at the behest of Zeus . He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it . Prometheus taught man to hunt , read , and heal their sick , but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor - quality offerings from humans , Zeus kept fire from mankind . Prometheus , being the creator , took back the fire from Zeus to give to man . When Zeus discovered this , he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus , where each day an eagle would peck out his liver , only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god . He was intended to suffer alone for eternity , but eventually Heracles ( Hercules ) released him . </P> <P> Prometheus was also a myth told in Latin , but was a very different story . In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water , again a very relevant theme to Frankenstein , as Victor rebels against the laws of nature ( how life is naturally made ) and as a result is punished by his creation . </P> In 1910 , Edison Studios released the first motion - picture adaptation of Shelley 's story . <P> The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein . Victor 's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans . </P> <P> Some have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil , and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat ( fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing ) . </P> <P> Byron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus , and Percy Shelley would soon write his own Prometheus Unbound ( 1820 ) . The term `` Modern Prometheus '' was actually coined by Immanuel Kant in reference to Benjamin Franklin and his experiments with electricity . </P> <H2> Shelley 's sources </H2> <P> Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work , one of which was the Promethean myth from Ovid . The influence of John Milton 's Paradise Lost , and Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , are also clearly evident within the novel . Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein 's character from Humphry Davy 's book Elements of Chemical Philosophy , in which he had written that `` science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative ; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ... '' . References to the French Revolution run through the novel ; a possible source may lie in François - Félix Nogaret ( fr ) 's Le Miroir des événemens actuels , ou la Belle au plus offrant ( 1790 ) : a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life - sized automaton . </P> <P> Within the past thirty years or so , many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers ( now called physical scientists ) with Shelley 's work on account of several notable similarities . Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley 's contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini , who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London and Johann Konrad Dippel , who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans . While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities , she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> Illustration by Theodor von Holst from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition <P> Frankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818 . Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views , along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author . The Belle Assemblee described the novel as `` very bold fiction '' ( 139 ) . The Quarterly Review stated that `` the author has the power of both conception and language '' ( 185 ) . Sir Walter Scott , writing in Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine congratulated `` the author 's original genius and happy power of expression '' ( 620 ) , although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language . The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see `` more productions from this author '' ( 253 ) . On the other hand , the Quarterly Review described it `` a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity '' . </P> <P> In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin , the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley . The British Critic attacks the novel 's flaws as the fault of the author : `` The writer of it is , we understand , a female ; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel ; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex , it is no reason why we should ; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment '' ( 438 ) . The Literary Panorama and National Register attacks the novel as a `` feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin 's novels '' produced by the `` daughter of a celebrated living novelist '' ( 414 ) . Despite the reviews , Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success . It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations -- Mary Shelley saw a production of Presumption ; or The Fate of Frankenstein , a play by Richard Brinsley Peake , in 1823 . A French translation appeared as early as 1821 ( Frankenstein : ou le Prométhée Moderne , translated by Jules Saladin ) . </P> <P> Critical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid-20th century . Major critics such as M.A. Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the `` aesthetic and moral '' relevance of the novel , although there are also critics such as Germaine Greer , who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects ( such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way ) . In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism : Lawrence Lipking states ' even the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism , for instance , has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel ' The novel today is generally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature , as well as science fiction . </P> <P> Film director Guillermo del Toro describes Frankenstein as `` the quintessential teenage book '' , adding `` You do n't belong .

It 's mind blowing .
