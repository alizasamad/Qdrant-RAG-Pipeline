Set in New York City , the film is loosely based on events in New York and Chicago from the early 1920s to 1931 during Prohibition , specifically the exploits of real - life gangsters like Al Capone and Bugs Moran , as dramatized in cinema . Parker lightened the subject matter considerably for the children 's market ; in the U.S. the film received a G rating . </P> <P> The film was Parker 's feature - length directorial debut , introduced actor Scott Baio , and featured a 13 - year old Jodie Foster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Casting </Li> <Li> 3.2 Music </Li> <Li> 3.3 Filming </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Release </Li> <Li> 5 Accolades </Li> <Li> 6 Home media </Li> <Li> 7 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 8 Legacy </Li> <Li> 9 Stage adaptation </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> A mobster named Roxy Robinson is `` splurged '' by members of a gang , using rapid - fire cream - shooting `` splurge guns '' . Once splurged , a kid is `` all washed up ... finished '' . Speakeasy boss Fat Sam introduces himself and Bugsy Malone , a boxing promoter with no money ( `` Bugsy Malone '' ) . </P> <P> At Fat Sam 's speakeasy , there is much dancing and singing ( `` Fat Sam 's Grand Slam '' ) . Fat Sam is worried that his rival Dandy Dan will try to take control of the speakeasy . Blousey Brown , an aspiring singer , has come for an audition , but Sam is too distracted to see her . Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage . He is smitten and flirts with her . Fat Sam 's is raided by Dandy Dan 's men , who shoot up the place . Dandy Dan 's men continue to attack Fat Sam 's empire , eventually taking away rackets and splurging members of Fat Sam 's gang . Fat Sam sends all his available men to see if they can track down the guns . They are trapped at a laundry and all are splurged by Dandy Dan 's gang . </P> <P> Bugsy returns to Fat Sam 's to arrange a new audition for Blousey . Fat Sam 's girlfriend , the chanteuse Tallulah , makes a pass at him . Although Bugsy rejects her flirtation , Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy 's forehead when Blousey enters ; Blousey is jealous . Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition , but she refuses to speak to Bugsy ( `` I 'm Feelin ' Fine '' ) . </P> <P> Fat Sam hires Bugsy to accompany him to a meeting with Dandy Dan . The meeting is a trap , but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape . Gratefully , Fat Sam pays him $200 . Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake ; Bugsy promises to take her to Hollywood . When he returns Sam 's car to the garage , he is attacked and his money is stolen . Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith , who assaults the attackers and drives them away . Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the potential to be a great boxer . Bugsy introduces Leroy to Cagey Joe and helps him train ( `` So You Wanna Be a Boxer ? '' ) . Fat Sam again seeks Bugsy 's aid after his assistant Knuckles is unintentionally killed . Bugsy resists , but Fat Sam offers $400 , enough money to keep his promise to Blousey . Blousey is disappointed when she learns that Bugsy has n't bought the tickets to California yet ( `` Ordinary Fool '' ) . Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan 's men to a warehouse , where the guns are being stashed . The two of them ca n't take the place alone , so Bugsy recruits a large group of down - and - out workers at a soup kitchen ( `` Down and Out '' ) . </P> <P> They steal the crates of guns and take them to Fat Sam 's , arriving just as Dandy Dan 's gang arrives . Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts , covering everyone ( except Bugsy and Blousey ) with cream . Unarmed patrons throw cream pies . The piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys , striking a single bass note . The tone silences the room , and the cream - covered crowd performs in a final number ( `` You Give a Little Love '' ) . They realize they can all be friends , and Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Scott Baio as Bugsy Malone , an Italian - Irish ex-boxer / boxing scout . </Li> <Li> Florrie Dugger as Blousey Brown , a sassy young dame interested in Hollywood . </Li> <Li> Jodie Foster as Tallulah , Fat Sam 's gun moll , the speakeasy 's star chanteuse and Bugsy 's old flame . </Li> <Li> John Cassisi as Fat Sam Staccetto , crime boss .

Parker was trying to find a film project that was not `` parochial '' and decided upon an American gangster setting : `` I had four young children and we used to go to a cottage in Derbyshire at weekends . On the long , boring car journey up there , I started telling them the story of a gangster called Bugsy Malone . They 'd ask me questions and I 'd make up answers , based on my memories of watching old movie reruns as a kid . '' His eldest son suggested children should be cast as the `` heroes '' . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> The director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film . To find his Fat Sam , Parker visited a Brooklyn classroom , asking for `` the naughtiest boy in class '' . The students were unanimous in selecting John Cassisi , and Parker gave him the role . Florrie Dugger ( Blousey ) was originally cast in a smaller role ; when the actress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio , Dugger was promoted . She had been `` discovered '' at RAF Chicksands , an air force base in Bedfordshire where her American father was stationed . At the time of filming , all of the cast were under 17 years old . </P> <P> Parker cast Baio after he slammed down the script and stormed out of his audition . Baio later remembered : </P> <P> I had quit the business , because I did n't like driving into Manhattan . Well , the long and the short of it is that I wanted to play with my friends after school , but it happened to be raining that day , so I went to the city to meet with Alan Parker . I read it , but I just barely read it . I did n't even want to be there . He was English , but I did n't even know what that was . He was just this weird guy with long hair , and I did n't know what he was . ( Laughs . ) So I sort of read the script , threw it at him , and walked out the door . That was it : I 'd gotten the part before I got home . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> Parker chose Paul Williams to score the film in order to get a more `` palatable '' modern sound , and simply because he liked him . Williams had scored Brian De Palma 's commercial failure Phantom of the Paradise , but had also written huge pop - radio hits ( such as `` We 've Only Just Begun '' ( lyrics ) , and `` ( Just An ) Old Fashioned Love Song '' ) . In fact , Williams would soon win an Oscar for his song `` Evergreen '' from the film A Star Is Born ( 1976 ) . </P> <P> Williams felt that `` ... the challenge for me was to provide songs that reflected the period ... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the young audiences attention . '' According to Parker , Williams was writing while on tour , recording songs in different cities , and sending the completed tapes to Hollywood . Arriving during the first pre-shoot rehearsals , the songs had to be accepted and used as they were , with voices by Williams , Archie Hahn and others . </P> <P> Neither the director nor the songwriter was entirely comfortable with the results . Williams later wrote `` I 'm really proud of the work and the only thing I 've ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices . Perhaps I should have given the kids a chance to sing the songs . '' Parker also commented : `` Watching the film after all these years , this is one aspect that I find the most bizarre . Adult voices coming out of these kids ' mouths ? I had told Paul that I did n't want squeaky kids voices and he interpreted this in his own way . Anyway , as the tapes arrived , scarcely weeks away from filming , we had no choice but to go along with it ! '' </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> The film was rehearsed and shot in England , largely on Pinewood Studios ' `` H '' stage , with locations in Black Park Country Park ( Wexham , Buckinghamshire ) and Reading , Berkshire . </P> <P> The `` splurge firearm '' proved to be problematic . After initial experiments with cream - filled wax balls proved painful , Parker decided to abandon the idea of filming the firearms directly . Instead , the firearms fired ping - pong balls , and a fast cut to a victim being pelted with `` splurge '' was used to convey the impression of the rapid - firing firearms . </P> <P> Baio later said making the film was `` awesome '' : </P> <P> A kid 's fantasy : You get to dress up as gangster , you get to shoot guns that fire whipped cream , you get to drive cars with pedals that look like real cars , and you get to talk like a grown - up . I mean , you could n't ask for a better first big gig . Talk about getting you hooked on a business ! It was fantastic . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Bugsy Malone was released in late 1976 to generally positive reviews . On Rotten Tomatoes , it currently holds a score of 83 % based on 18 reviews , with an average rating of 6.6 / 10 . Despite the positive critical reception , Bugsy Malone was not a commercial success in the US , bringing in just over $2.7 million . Paramount gave it a limited release , usually in second - tier theaters in a double - bill with The Bad News Bears , which had already been out for six months and was no longer much of a draw . According to Parker , the film was `` quite successful '' in the United Kingdom . By 1985 , it had earned an estimated profit of £ 1,854,000 . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film garnered 15 award nominations , including `` Best Motion Picture ( Musical / Comedy ) '' , `` Best Original Score '' and `` Best Original Song '' ( for the title track ) from the Golden Globes , and an Oscar for `` Best Original Song Score '' ( Paul Williams ) . The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival . Actress Jodie Foster received two BAFTAs , `` Best Supporting Actress '' and `` Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles '' , however , both her nominations were for her previous year 's work in Taxi Driver in addition to her work on Bugsy Malone . Alan Parker received the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay , and a nomination for Best Direction . Geoffrey Kirkland won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design . Additionally , Paul Williams received a nomination for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , and Monica Howe a Best Costume Design nomination . The film itself received a Best Picture nomination . </P> <P> In 2008 , the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list . </P> <H2> Home media ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the early eighties , Bugsy Malone was released on VHS . On 16 April 1996 , it was re-released by Paramount on VHS . Although the film has never been commercially released on Region 1 DVD , it has been available through Internet sites as an Asian import supporting Region 1 ( US ) . On 9 September 2008 , Arista / SME released a Blu - ray version , encoded for `` all regions '' , as a United Kingdom import . This edition includes a director 's commentary as well as other special features , however , as of October 2009 , the Blu - ray version was discontinued . A US DVD ( Region 1 ) release was listed around 2003 / 04 as being available soon , however the film has yet to be released in this format . </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> CD cover <P> The album was originally released as an LP in 1976 . In March 1996 , Polydor UK released the soundtrack on CD . It has yet to be released in the US on CD but is available through various outlets as an import . </P> <P> Performers include Paul Williams , Archie Hahn , Julie McWhirter , and Liberty Williams . The track listing is : </P> <Ol> <Li> `` Bugsy Malone '' -- Paul Williams </Li> <Li> `` Fat Sam 's Grand Slam '' -- Paul Williams </Li> <Li> `` Tomorrow '' </Li> <Li> `` Bad Guys '' </Li> <Li> `` I 'm Feeling Fine '' </Li> <Li> `` My Name Is Tallulah '' - Louise `` Liberty '' Williams </Li> <Li> `` So You Wanna Be a Boxer ?

Like the stage show , this recording featured two songs originally written by Williams , but not used in the film : `` That 's Why They Call Him Dandy '' and `` Show Business '' . There is also some additional incidental orchestral score , such as an Overture and Exit Music , with music arranged by John Pearson . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2003 , Bugsy Malone was voted # 19 on a list of the 100 greatest musicals , as chosen by viewers of Channel 4 in the UK , placing it higher than The Phantom of the Opera , Cats , and The King and I. Bugsy Malone ranks 353rd on Empire Magazine 's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time . </P> <P> Bugsy Malone has been adapted into a stage show in two forms . A 2003 television documentary called Bugsy Malone : After They Were Famous features a reunion and interviews with Jodie Foster , Scott Baio , John Cassisi and Florrie Dugger . The British actors who played Fat Sam 's gang are also reunited at Pinewood Studios . The documentary reported that Dugger , who ( unlike her co-stars ) had never acted again , had chosen to pursue a career in the United States Air Force Medical Service . </P> <P> In 2010 , UK band Silvery included a cover of `` You Give a Little Love '' on their second album ' Railway Architecture ' , and Olly Murs , runner up in the 2009 UK series of The X Factor , sampled `` So You Wanna Be a Boxer '' in his song `` Hold On '' that can be found on his debut album . </P> <P> In 2011 , the film was the most screened film in secondary schools in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> In 2017 , the song `` You Give A Little Love '' was sung by a children 's chorus at the end of a Netflix `` Black Mirror '' episode ( Season 4 episode 3 `` Crocodile '' ) . </P> <H2> Stage adaptation ( edit ) </H2> <P> Parker wrote the book for a stage adaptation of Bugsy Malone , using Williams ' music . This premiered in the West End in 1983 at Her Majesty 's Theatre and ran for 300 performances . It was directed by Michael Dolenz and the cast featured Catherine Zeta - Jones as Tallulah . In 1997 , the National Youth Music Theatre mounted an all - youth version . It was revived at the Queen 's Theatre in 1997 , starring Sheridan Smith and Jamie Bell . Another revival played in 2015 and again in 2016 at the Lyric Hammersmith theatre , where it was nominated for the Olivier Award for best musical revival . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` BUGSY MALONE ( U ) '' .
