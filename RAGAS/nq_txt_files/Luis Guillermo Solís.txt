He is a member of the center - left Citizens ' Action Party ( PAC ) . Solís led the field in the 2014 presidential election , and he was effectively handed the presidency after the runner - up in the first round , San José mayor Johnny Araya Monge , ceased active campaigning . Solís has a long academic and political career , culminating in his election as the first President of Costa Rica to be a member of the PAC . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life , education , and academic career </Li> <Li> 2 Political beginnings </Li> <Li> 3 2014 presidential campaign </Li> <Li> 4 Presidency <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Economic issues <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Liquidity problems </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Political , economic , and social philosophy </Li> <Li> 6 Personal life </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life , education , and academic career ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solís was born in San José , Costa Rica , to Vivienne Rivera Allen , an educator , and Freddy Solís Avendaño , an uneducated shoemaker . Both his parents lived in Turrialba , and as such many residents consider him Turrialban . His family has Afro - Caribbean and Chinese roots , coming from Jamaica to Costa Rica in the early 1900s . Solís grew up in San Pedro de Montes de Oca and Curridabat , neighborhoods of San José . He attended Methodist High School in San José , where he was president of the student body , before studying history at the University of Costa Rica , where he earned a degree with academic honors in 1979 . He earned a master 's degree in Latin American Studies at Tulane University in New Orleans . </P> <P> Solís has held various academic and consulting positions . Between 1981 and 1987 , he was an associate professor at the University of Costa Rica . In addition , he was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Michigan from 1983 to 1985 . During this time , Solís worked with the Arias administration and eventually became director of the Center for Peace and Reconciliation ( CPR for its Spanish initials ) . From 1992 to 1995 , Solís worked with the Academic Council of the United Nations System . Starting in 1999 , Solís worked for Florida International University as coordinator in the Center for the Administration of Justice and as a researcher for the Latin American and Caribbean Center , where he analyzed political and social events in Latin America . </P> <P> A writer and editorial writer , Solís has published numerous essays and books about national and international affairs . In the 1990s , he wrote for La República , a daily newspaper based in San José . His writing has been published by Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica , Frontera Norte , Espacios and Global Governance . His writing has focused on civil society , international relations , and trade . </P> <H2> Political beginnings ( edit ) </H2> <P> While still at UCR , Solís joined the National Liberation Party ( PLN for its Spanish initials ) in 1977 . Solís was an adviser to Óscar Arias in the Foreign Ministry , working on the Esquipulas Peace Agreement for which Arias would later win a Nobel Peace Prize . Solís served as Director of International Relations for the PLN . During José María Figueres Olsen 's time in office , Solís was ambassador of Central American Affairs . </P> <P> In 2002 , Solís followed Rolando González Ulloa as General Secretary of the PLN , a position he resigned from the following year , citing his disappointment with the Alcatel - Lucent bribery scandal that many PLN leaders were involved in . In 2005 , he denounced the PLN for irregularities and corruption during party elections , along with a host of former PLN members . Solís went as far as to call the PLN leadership `` Napoleonic '' and `` anti-democratic '' . He officially renounced his affiliation with the party and returned to academics . </P> <P> After the 2006 election , Solís ' name began to come up in PAC circles , particularly at meetings of the `` ungroup , '' an informal gathering of PAC officials , led by former deputy and former Vice President of the National University of Costa Rica Alberto Salom Echeverría . Ottón Solís , one of PAC 's founders and three - time presidential candidate , suggested that Luis Guillermo Solís run as a vice presidential candidate in 2010 . Luis Guillermo Solis rejected the offer because he was working for the General Secretariat of Ibero - America ( SEGIB for its Spanish initials ) , and employees of SEGIB were not allowed to participate in elections . </P> <P> In 2009 , Luis Guillermo Solís began his official affiliation with PAC . He began attending meetings of the `` ungroup '' in 2010 . Within the party , PAC leader María Eugenia Venegas recognized Solís ' potential and pushed for him to be elevated within the party . Solís undertook several trips around the country to meet with national and provincial PAC leaders . </P> <H2> 2014 presidential campaign ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solís announced his candidacy for president on 27 November 2012 . In the PAC 's primary , he ran against Epsy Campbell Barr , Juan Carlos Mendoza García , and Ronald Solís Bolaños , winning with 35 percent of the vote , only 110 votes more than Juan Carlos Mendoza García . </P> <P> In October 2013 , he chose Helio Fallas and Ana Helena Chacón Echeverría as his Vice-Presidential running mates . Among his aims , Solís claimed he would clean up corruption , create major investments in infrastructure , and shore up Costa Rica 's universal health care and social security system . He also promised to continue initiatives to keep Costa Rica environmentally friendly . He said that he would `` put the brakes '' on new free trade agreements and would begin correctly administrating current free trade agreements . As such , Solís received a tremendous amount of political support from the country 's trade unions . </P> <P> On 2 February 2014 , Solís won the most votes in the election with 30.95 percent . PLN candidate Johnny Araya came second with 29.95 percent of the vote . Most of Solís ' support came from the Central Valley provinces of San José , Alajuela , Heredia and Cartago . </P> PAC supporters wave their traditional colors to celebrate Luis Guillermo Solís ' victory on 6 April 2014 <P> Because no candidate exceeded 40 percent of the vote , a runoff was scheduled for 6 April , as required by the constitution . However , on 5 March , Araya announced that he would abandon his campaign after polls showed him far behind Solís ; one poll showed him losing by over 43 percent . However , under Costa Rican law the runoff still had to take place , and Solís won with over 77 percent of the vote , the largest margin ever recorded for a free election in Costa Rica . Unlike the first round , Solís earned a majority in every province , including Puntarenas , Limón , and Guanacaste . When he took office on 8 May , he was the first president in 66 years not to come from the PLN or what is now the PUSC . </P> <P> Immediately after the election , Solís thanked Costa Rican voters . He received congratulatory notes from world leaders , including US Secretary of State John Kerry , Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa , Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto , Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , Bolivian President Evo Morales , and the spokesperson from the French Ministry of International Affairs . For his part , Araya congratulated Solís on his victory , calling for national unity . </P> <H2> Presidency ( edit ) </H2> Solís speaking in 2014 <P> A little over a week before taking office , in April 2014 , Solís announced the creation of his cabinet . His cabinet consists of mostly PAC members or non-aligned citizens . However , two PUSC members were also added : María del Rocío Sáenz , Abel Pacheco 's former health minister , heads the Costa Rican Social Security System ( Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social ) . Delia Villalobos , another former health minister , heads the Social Protection Council ( Consejo de Seguridad ) . </P> <P> Solís took office on 8 May 2014 , amid festive fanfare . Delegations from more than 80 countries attended his inauguration at La Sabana Metropolitan Park , including Prince Felipe de Borbón of Spain , Evo Morales of Bolivia , Rafael Correa of Ecuador , and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States , José Miguel Insulza . Solís said , in Costa Rican vernacular , that he is taking over a `` weed farm '' ( finca encharralada ) , pointing out growing income inequality and poverty , as well as a national teachers ' strike . </P> <H3> Economic issues ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2014 , President Solís presented a budget with an increase in spending of 19 % for 2015 , an increase of 0.5 % for 2016 and an increase of 12 % for 2017 . When the 2017 budget was finally proposed , it totaled US $15.9 billion . Debt payments account for one - third of that amount . Of greater concern is the fact that a full 46 % of the budget will require financing , a step that will increase the debt owed to foreign entities . </P> <P> The country 's credit rating was reduced by Moody 's Investors Service in early 2017 to Ba2 from Ba1 , with a negative outlook on the rating . The agency particularly cited the `` rising government debt burden and persistently high fiscal deficit , which was 5.2 % of GDP in 2016 '' . Moody 's was also concerned about the `` lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the fiscal deficit ( which ) will result in further pressure on the government 's debt ratios '' . In late July 2017 , the Costa Rica Central Bank estimated the budget deficit at 6.1 percent of the country 's GDP . </P> <P> A 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt must be a very high priority for the government . Other fiscal reforms were also recommended to moderate the budget deficit . </P> Liquidity problems ( edit ) <P> In early August 2017 , the President promised admitted that the country was facing a `` liquidity crisis '' and promised that a higher VAT tax and higher income tax rates were being considered by his government . Such steps are essential , Solís told the nation , because it was facing difficulties in paying its obligations and guaranteeing the provision of services . '' `` Despite all the public calls and efforts we have made since the start of my administration to contain spending and increase revenues , there is still a gap that we must close with fresh resources , '' he said . The crisis was occurring in spite of growth , low inflation and continued moderate interest rates , Solís concluded . </P> <P> He explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt first , then salaries , and then pensions . The subsequent priorities include transfers to institutions `` according to their social urgency . '' All other payments will be made only if funds are available . </P> <H2> Political , economic , and social philosophy ( edit ) </H2> The past generated two different economies : one very dynamic , modern and generally oriented toward international markets , with limited possibilities for new sources of employment , and the other , traditional , which created many jobs with low pay where small and medium - sized businesses concentrated . Luis Guillermo Solís , Plan Rescate , 2014 - 2018 <P> Like most members of PAC , Solís identifies himself as a progressivist . His Plan Rescate , or Rescue Plan , outlines his political beliefs . This plan focused on three central issues : anti-corruption , economic growth , and reducing income inequality . </P> <P> Solís claims that economic neoliberalism has created too much income inequality for Costa Rica . Past governments have avoided collecting taxes on large companies and high - income earners , leading to budget deficits which Solís claims his administration will fix through better enforcement . Banks should not encourage exports at the expense of income growth among the poor , according to Solís . He believes that economic liberalization has generally harmed women more than men because they have traditionally had less access to higher - income jobs . Part of that liberalization , he claims , included ignoring the financial and growth needs of the agricultural industry . </P> <P> Solís supports environmental protections , which he believes Costa Rica has forgotten . As such , Solís believes that water must be safeguarded from private development and mismanagement , something that has caused water shortages in many of the country 's municipalities . Solís claims that he will prosecute violators of the Water Resources Management Bill . </P> <P> In addition , Solís supports increased rights for rights for lesbians , gays , bisexuals , and transsexuals . In May 2014 , he ordered that a rainbow flag be flown over the Presidential House as a show of solidarity with gays on International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia . </P> <P> Solís is a Catholic . As a presidential candidate , he visited the basilica of Our Lady of Angels , home to the Costa Rican patron saint La Negrita , a traditional pilgrimage for many Costa Ricans and tourists . He supports the separation of church and state despite Catholicism being the country 's official religion . With regard to ethical issues , he also supports civil unions , and in - vitro fertilization . </P> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Solis has ten children from his previous marriage to his first wife , Nancy Olive Worsfold Richards ( 1987 -- 2006 ) : Monica , Cristina , Beatriz , Charlie , Carly , Jennifer , John , Carlos , Diego and Ignacio . </P> <P> Solís is not married to Mercedes Peñas Domingo , but she is altogether considered the First Lady of Costa Rica . He and Peñas , who began dating in 2006 , have one daughter , Inés . Peñas said that she hopes to be active as an adviser to Solís , who called her `` Jiminy Cricket . '' Saying that some of her duties as First Lady are machista , she will nevertheless greet dignitaries and perform other obligations . In addition to public service and academics , Solís enjoys farming . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Romo , Jose Luis ( 2015 - 03 - 15 ) . `` Mercedes Peñas , la primera dama española y atípica de Costa Rica '' .
