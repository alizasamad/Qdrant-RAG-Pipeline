Collaborating with lyricist Don Black , it was written for the song cycle show Tell Me on a Sunday in 1978 . It was sung and released by Marti Webb in 1980 , and became a No. 3 hit in the UK charts . The song was also popular in Ireland , and spent six weeks at number one . Later , Tell Me on a Sunday was combined with another Lloyd Webber work , Variations , to form an entire new show , Song and Dance . </P> <P> The song is about a woman being told of her boyfriend 's infidelity . The woman denies this initially , before rebuking her newsbearer ( a girlfriend ) with the revelation that she `` knew before '' and had done for some time . She also spends much of the song criticising her friend for rushing to break the `` bad news '' to her . </P> <P> Despite having been written during the creative process for Tell Me on a Sunday , the song was n't recorded during the album 's principal sessions . Black reminded Lloyd Webber that they had missed a track , then entitled `` You Must Be Mistaken '' . John Mole , the bass guitar player , improvised a part reminiscent of the arrangement style of Phil Spector , inspiring the rest of the orchestration . The track was recorded in one take , apart from a double tracking of the orchestra . </P> <P> A briefer 3 : 02 edit of the song is included on the album , however , a longer 3 : 29 version remixed with greater dynamic range compression was released as the single . </P> <H2> Track listing ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Side A : `` Take That Look Off Your Face '' </Li> <Li> Side B : `` Sheldon Bloom '' </Li> </Ul> <H2> Revisions ( edit ) </H2> <P> The lyrics were substantially rewritten by Richard Maltby , Jr for the original Broadway production of Song and Dance . The British productions of the show have always used the lyrics written by Black . </P> <P> Black himself amended the line , `` He 's doing some deal up in Baltimore now '' after realising that Baltimore is south of New York . In subsequent versions , the song 's protagonist is said to be `` down '' in Baltimore . </P> <P> For the 2003 production of Tell Me on a Sunday , the storyline instead placed the action in England prior to an emigration to New York , requiring some further revision of the lyrics to reference London instead . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <P> </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This 1970s song - related article is a stub .
