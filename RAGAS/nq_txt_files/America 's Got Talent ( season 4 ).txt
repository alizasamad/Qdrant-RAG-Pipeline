Out of the over 160 acts that passed through the preliminary auditions , 48 went on to perform in the live shows . This season , the callbacks were renamed `` The Vegas Verdicts '' . Unlike previous seasons , the acts were not given a chance to perform a second time , unless prompted by the judges to as a challenge . The judges re-watched audition tapes and created a Top 40 based on the acts ' preliminary performances , similar to the format used on sister show Britain 's Got Talent . However , it was revealed during the first performance show that the judges , when prompted by executive producer Simon Cowell , called back eight acts that they previously had cut . This brought the total number of acts up to 48 . Last season , the acts who passed through were divided into four groups , who performed over the course of two weeks with the acts who passed through from the previous night being announced before the next group of acts ' performances . This year , each group in the Top 48 was divided into four groups of 12 , but only one group performed per week , as a separate results show for the group aired the next day . This season was the first to feature results episodes lasting one hour on a weekly basis since season one . </P> <P> During the performances episodes , if all three judges buzzed an act , the act was forced to end , unlike the previous season , where it could continue on for a short time . In the results episodes , five best acts from each group of twelve proceeded to the semi-finals - four acts were determined solely by viewers ' votes , the judges decided between acts with the fifth and sixth highest viewers ' vote totals . The twelve acts were presented to the audience in groups of two or three ( usually similar acts - e.g. dancers , children - are put together ) and then the host announced which of them moved forward and which of them had been eliminated . When three acts are presented as a group , the host would first announce an act from the three as the first act eliminated , then would announce which act from the remaining two remained in the competition . The final group were acts in the fifth and sixth places and the judges pick one of them by majority voting . At no time was the audience made aware of how many viewers ' votes each act received . </P> <P> In the semifinals , the twenty acts who passed through the quarterfinals were divided into groups of 10 . One of these groups performed each week , with a performance episode followed by the results the following day . Only four acts were supposed to pass through to the finals each week . Three are determined solely by viewers ' votes , but the fourth and fifth place acts must face the judges ' decision . However , in one case , the judges passed through both performers , as they could not make a decision . In the other case , the top five acts were passed through . Instead of previous seasons , where the finals contain four or five acts , this season the finale contained ten acts . </P> <H2> Preliminary auditions ( edit ) </H2> <P> This year , auditions were held in New York City , Houston , Los Angeles , Chicago , Miami , and Seattle / Tacoma . Auditions were also held in Boston , Atlanta , and Washington , D.C. but not televised . A total of 160 acts advanced to the Las Vegas Round . </P> <H2> Second round ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Vegas Verdicts ( edit ) </H3> <P> Vegas Verdicts aired on July 28 , 2009 and July 29 , 2009 . Over the course of the two episodes , the over 160 acts that made it through the preliminary rounds were narrowed down to a Top 40 that made it through to the live performance rounds . </P> <P> In the first episode of the `` Vegas Verdicts '' , as Cannon referred to it , the episode started off with 25 of the 160 acts being eliminated right at the Las Vegas Airport . The remaining acts were then briefly shown enjoying the sights of Vegas , before the eliminations resumed . Acts were brought before the judges and informed of their fate . The judges selected three dance groups : Destined 2 Be , BreakSk8 , and U4ria Dance Crew for a challenge . They were asked to prepare a dance routine for 12 hours plus they 'll have the same piece of music . After they perform , the judges will decide which dance groups will advance to the Top 40 Quarterfinals . </P> <P> In the second episode , the remainder of the Top 40 was revealed , and many more acts were eliminated . The three dance crews challenged in the previous episode were shown in a montage performing their challenge performance . </P> <P> At the end of the second episode , Simon Cowell , executive producer of the show , called the judges on their flight back to Los Angeles , stating that he was unhappy with some of the eliminations the judges made . Cowell revealed that there was just `` too much talent '' eliminated , and that he felt that a number of these acts should be given another chance . As a result , two acts were brought back as wildcards during each quarterfinal round . </P> First cut ( edit ) <P> Acts that were eliminated at the Las Vegas Airport include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Circus R Us <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Contortion , hula hoops on unicycles </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Tallan Noble Latz <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : 9 - year - old electric guitarist </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Nathan Burton <Ul> <Li> Preliminaries , Episode 7 `` : Magician , he also appeared in season one </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Kari Callin <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Singer , sang `` Somewhere '' from West Side Story </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Ciana Pelekai <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 10 '' : 8 - year - old singer , sang `` At Last '' . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alex Wesley <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 10 '' : 53 - year - old dancer . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Part one cuts ( edit ) <P> Acts that were cut in the first episode of the Vegas Verdict included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Keith Johnson <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Singer and guitarist , performed `` Walking in Memphis '' by Marc Cohn . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Tony Ferrante <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : 74 - year - old dancer , performed to `` You Make Me Feel ( Mighty Real ) '' by Sylvester James . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Joseph Constantine <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Magician </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Spiritual Harmonizers <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : Close harmony singing group of Post Office workers . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Fuchsia FoXXX <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Belly dancer </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Hurricane Tricksters <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 4 '' : Trickers </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 1 ) '' : Eliminated </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Part two cuts ( edit ) <P> Acts that were cut in the second episode of the Vegas Verdict included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Rashida Jolley <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Performed and sang `` Killing Me Softly '' on the harp . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Christopher & Laura Camp <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Whip act </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Duo Design <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Hand balancers . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Flash <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Jugglers and acrobats . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Kalinins <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 8 '' : Father and son acrobats . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Arthur Gulkarov <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 7 '' : Contortionist and dancer </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Kara & Corey Britz <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Sibling guitarist / singer duo , performed `` Every Breath You Take '' by The Police . </Li> <Li> `` Las Vegas Week ( Part 2 ) '' : Eliminated . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Serenades <Ul> <Li> `` Preliminaries , Episode 9 '' : Singers .

Twelve acts ( ten of the original Top 40 , plus two wildcards ) performed each week . A two - hour performance episode each Tuesday was followed by a one - hour results show the following day , where five of the twelve acts from the previous night remained in the competition . When an act got buzzed by all three judges , they must stop , unlike in the previous seasons , where at this stage acts were allowed to continue despite being buzzed by all judges . A large X appeared on the screen on stage , indicating the act had been struck out by the judges . Viewers were still able to vote for the buzzed act . The judges ' choice , however , remained , as the judges got to decide whether the contestant who placed either in fifth or sixth place got to advance to the next round . </P> <H3> Week 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The performance episode aired on August 4 , 2009 , 2 hours . </P> <P> The results episode aired on August 5 , 2009 , 1 hour .
