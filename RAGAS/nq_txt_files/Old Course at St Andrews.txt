It is held in trust by The St Andrews Links Trust under an act of Parliament . The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews club house sits adjacent to the first tee , although it is but one of many clubs that have playing privileges on the course , along with the general public . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Governance </Li> <Li> 1.2 Influence on modern golf </Li> <Li> 1.3 Old Course and Bobby Jones </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Features </Li> <Li> 3 The Open Championship </Li> <Li> 4 Scorecard </Li> <Li> 5 Women 's British Open </Li> <Li> 6 Senior Open Championship </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Old Course at St Andrews is considered by many to be the `` home of golf '' because the sport was first played on the Links at St Andrews in the early 15th century . Golf was becoming increasingly popular in Scotland until in 1457 , when James II of Scotland banned golf because he felt that young men were playing too much golf instead of practising their archery . The ban was upheld by the following kings of Scotland until 1502 , when King James IV became a golfer himself and removed the ban . </P> <H3> Governance ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1552 , Archbishop John Hamilton gave the townspeople of St. Andrews the right to play on the links . In 1754 , 22 noblemen , professors , and landowners founded the Society of St Andrews Golfers . This society would eventually become the precursor to the Royal and Ancient which is the governing body for golf everywhere outside of the United States and Mexico . St Andrews Links had a scare when they went bankrupt in 1797 . The Town Council of St. Andrews decided to allow rabbit farming on the golf course to challenge golf for popularity . Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf . The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many years , though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in the 1850s and Old Tom Morris ( 1865 -- 1908 ) , who designed the 1st and 18th holes . Originally , it was played over the same set of fairways out and back to the same holes . As interest in the game increased , groups of golfers would often be playing the same hole , but going in different directions . </P> <H3> Influence on modern golf ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Old Course was pivotal to the development of how the game is played today . For instance , in 1764 , the course had 22 holes . The members would play the same hole going out and in with the exception of the 11th and 22nd holes . The members decided that the first four and last four holes on the course were too short and should be combined into four total holes ( two in and two out ) . St Andrews then had 18 holes and that was how the standard of 18 holes was created . Around 1863 , Old Tom Morris had the 1st green separated from the 17th green , producing the current 18 - hole layout with seven double greens and four single greens . The Old Course is home of The Open Championship , the oldest of golf 's major championships . The Old Course has hosted this major 29 times since 1873 , most recently in 2015 . The 29 Open Championships that the Old Course has hosted is more than any other course , and The Open is currently played there every five years . </P> <H3> Old Course and Bobby Jones ( edit ) </H3> <P> Bobby Jones ( who later founded Augusta National ) first played St Andrews in the 1921 Open Championship . During the third round , he infamously hit his ball into a bunker on the 11th hole . After he took four swings at the ball and still could not get out , after losing his temper , he continued the round , but did not turn in score card , thus disqualifying himself . However , he did continue to play in the fourth round . Six years later , when the Open Championship returned to St Andrews , Jones also returned . Not only did he win , he also became the first amateur to win back - to - back Open Championships . He won wire - to - wire , shooting a 285 ( 7 - under - par ) , which was the lowest score at either a U.S. Open or Open Championship at the time . He ended up winning the tournament by a decisive six strokes . </P> <P> In 1930 , Jones returned to St Andrews for the British Amateur . He won , beating Roger Wethered by a score of 7 and 6 in the final match . He subsequently won the other three majors , making him the only man in the history of the sport to win the Grand Slam . Jones went on to fall in love with the Old Course for the rest of his life . Years later , he said `` If I had to select one course upon which to play the match of my life , I should have selected the Old Course . '' In 1958 the town of St Andrews gave Jones the key to the city ; he was only the second American to receive the honour ( after Benjamin Franklin in 1759 ) . After he received the key , he said `` I could take out of my life everything but my experiences here in St. Andrews and I would still have had a rich and full life . '' </P> <H2> Features ( edit ) </H2> `` I 'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there . St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career . '' -- Jack Nicklaus on finishing his career at St Andrews , 2005 . The Swilcan Bridge is one of the most iconic attractions in golf The 18th hole towards the clubhouse of the R&A in 2006 . A largely unchanged view in 1891 . <P> One of the unique features of the Old Course are the large double greens . Seven greens are shared by two holes each , with hole numbers adding up to 18 ( 2nd paired with 16th , 3rd with 15th , all the way up to 8th and 10th ) . The Swilcan Bridge , spanning the first and 18th holes , has become a famous icon for golf in the world . Everyone who plays the 18th hole walks over this 700 - year - old bridge , and many iconic pictures of the farewells of the most iconic golfers in history have been taken on this bridge . A life - size stone replica of the Bridge is situated at the World Golf Hall of Fame museum in St. Augustine , Florida . Only the 1st , 9th , 17th and 18th holes have their own greens . Another unique feature is that the course can be played in either direction , clockwise or anti-clockwise . Along with that , the Old Course has 112 bunkers which are all individually named and have their own unique story and history behind them . The two most famous are the 10 ft deep `` Hell Bunker '' on the 14th hole , and the `` Road Bunker '' on the 17th hole . Countless professional golfers have seen their dreams of winning the Open Championship squandered by hitting their balls into those bunkers . </P> <P> The Old Course is also home of The Road Hole , the par - 4 17th , one of the world 's most famous golf holes . Among its unique features are : </P> <Ul> <Li> Players using the back tees can not see where their tee shots land . This is not unusual except that they must take aim over a corner of replica railway sheds which lie beyond the out of bounds wall . The original sheds were torn down when the rail line running next to the course closed , and after several Opens were played without the tee shot being blind , replicas of the sheds were created in preparation for the 1984 Open . </Li> <Li> Other than rough , the primary hazard in front of the green is a sand trap known as the `` Road Bunker . '' </Li> <Li> Over the back of the green , hazards include a tarmac roadway , as well as an old stone wall . Both are in play ; a wayward shot can lead a player to take their next stroke off the roadway or to hit the face of the wall and take their chances with the ensuing bounce . </Li> </Ul> <P> The general method of play today is counterclockwise , although clockwise play has been permitted on one day each year in recent years , and for several special one off events since . Originally , the course was reversed every week in order to let the grass recover better . One other unusual thing about the Old Course is that it is closed on Sundays to let the course rest . On some Sundays , the course turns into a park for all the townspeople who come out to stroll , picnic and otherwise enjoy the grounds . As a general rule , Sunday play is allowed on the course on only four occasions : </P> <Ul> <Li> The final day of the Dunhill Links Championship , an annual event on the European Tour . </Li> <Li> The final day of any R&A sanctioned Open Championships -- men and women , and the men over 50 when it is held at the Old Course ; this happens roughly once every five years for the men ; the women 's championship began its turn on the rotation in 2007 , and the over-50 championship began in 2018 . </Li> <Li> The final day of two top amateur events , the St Andrews Links Trophy and the St Rule Trophy . </Li> </Ul> <P> Sunday play may also occur when the Old Course hosts other major events ; for example , when it hosted the Curtis Cup in 2008 . </P> <P> While winning the Open Championship is a crowning achievement for any golfer , a win at St Andrews is considered particularly important due to the course 's long tradition . Past winners at St Andrews include Tiger Woods ( twice ) , Louis Oosthuizen , John Daly , Zach Johnson ( first Monday finish since 1988 ) , Nick Faldo , Seve Ballesteros , Jack Nicklaus ( twice ) , Tony Lema , Kel Nagle , Bobby Locke , Peter Thomson , Sam Snead , Dick Burton , Denny Shute , Bobby Jones , Jock Hutchison , James Braid ( twice ) , John Henry Taylor ( twice ) , Hugh Kirkaldy , Jack Burns , Bob Martin ( twice ) , Jamie Anderson , Tom Kidd , Lorena Ochoa , and most recently Stacy Lewis at the 2013 Women 's British Open . </P> <P> In 2005 the Old Course was ranked as the greatest golf course outside the United States , by Golf Digest . </P> <P> Since 1990 , the Old Course has been unique on the Open roster in holding the Championship every five years . However , this sequence has been broken with the announcement that the 2020 Championship will be at Royal St. George 's . The reason for this is that the 2021 Championship will be the 150th , and is expected to be played on the Old Course although no official announcement has yet been made . </P> <H2> The Open Championship ( edit ) </H2> The `` road bunker '' at the 17th hole .
