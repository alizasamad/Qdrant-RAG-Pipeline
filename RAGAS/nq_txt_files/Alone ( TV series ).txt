The first , second and fourth seasons were filmed on northern Vancouver Island , British Columbia , and the third near Nahuel Huapi National Park in Patagonia , Argentina . It follows the self - documented daily struggles of 10 individuals ( 7 paired teams in season 4 ) as they survive in the wilderness for as long as possible using a limited amount of survival equipment . With the exception of medical check - ins , the participants are isolated from each other and all other humans . They may `` tap out '' at any time , or be removed due to failing a medical check - in . The contestant ( or team in Season 4 ) who remains the longest wins a grand prize of $500,000 . </P> <P> The series premiered on June 18 , 2015 . On August 19 , before the finale of season 1 , it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season , which would begin production in the fall of 2015 on Vancouver Island , Canada . Season 2 premiered on April 21 , 2016 . Season 3 was filmed in the second quarter of 2016 in Patagonia , Argentina and premiered on December 8 . One day before the season 3 premiere , History announced that casting had begun for season 4 . </P> <P> In January 2017 , a Danish version of the series premiered with the name Alone in the Wilderness ( Danish : Alene i vildmarken ) on DR3 . It featured ten contestants and was filmed in northern Norway . Participants chose 12 items from a list of 18 . </P> <P> In the fall of 2017 , a Norwegian version aired with 10 contestants spread around a lake with fish . It was near the tree line , so the few , small , mostly birch trees left few land resources . The last contestant tapped out after a little more than a month . </P> <P> The fifth season premiered on June 7 , 2018 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Format and rules <Ul> <Li> 1.1 General rules - all seasons </Li> <Li> 1.2 Season 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Season 5 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Reception </Li> <Li> 3 Episodes </Li> <Li> 4 Series overview <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Season 1 <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.2 Season 2 <Ul> <Li> 4.2. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.2. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.3 Season 3 <Ul> <Li> 4.3. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.3. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.4 Season 4 <Ul> <Li> 4.4. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.4. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.5 Season 5 <Ul> <Li> 4.5. 1 Location </Li> <Li> 4.5. 2 Contestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Format and rules ( edit ) </H2> <H3> General rules - all seasons ( edit ) </H3> <P> Contestants are dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island ( seasons 1 - 2 , 4 ) , Patagonia ( season 3 ) and Northern Mongolia ( season 5 ) , far enough apart to ensure that they will not come in contact with one another . The process begins in mid to late autumn ; this adds time pressure to the survival experience as the approaching winter causes temperatures to drop and food to become scarce . Although terrains may differ in each contestant 's location , the drop - off zones are assessed in advance to ensure a similar distribution of local resources is available to each contestant . </P> <P> Contestants each select 10 items of survival gear from a pre-approved list of 40 , and are issued a kit of standard equipment , clothing and first aid / emergency supplies . They are also given a set of cameras to document their daily experiences and emotions . Attempting to live in the wild for as long as possible , the contestants must find food , build shelters , and endure extreme isolation and psychological distress . </P> <P> Contestants who wish to withdraw from the competition for any reason ( referred to as `` tapping out '' ) may signal a rescue crew using a provided satellite telephone . In addition , medical professionals conduct periodic health checks on the contestants and may , at their discretion , disqualify and evacuate anyone they feel is unable to continue participating safely . The last remaining contestant wins a $500,000 cash prize . Contestants are warned that the show might last for up to a year . </P> <H3> Season 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 4 was also filmed in Northern Vancouver Island but included a team dynamic . Fourteen contestants , consisting of seven family - member pairs , were individually dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island . The two members of each team chose 10 items of survival gear to be equally divided between them . The team chose one member to be taken to a campsite ; the other began approximately 10 mi ( 16.09 km ) away and was required to hike to the site , using only a compass and bearing to find the way . Either member may tap out at any time , but doing so removed both of them from the competition ; in addition , if either member of a team was medically evacuated , both were disqualified . The last remaining team won the $500,000 prize . </P> <H3> Season 5 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 5 contestants were selected from non-winning contestants from Seasons 1 through 4 . The rules were otherwise similar to Seasons 1 through 3 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series received positive reviews in its first season and outstanding reviews for its third season , and earned a respectable 2.5 million total viewers , placing it in the top three new nonfictional cable series of 2015 . </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of Alone episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan="2"> Season </Th> <Th_colspan="2"> Episodes </Th> <Th_colspan="2"> Originally aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> First aired </Th> <Th> Last aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> </Td> <Td_colspan="2"> 11 </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> June 18 , 2015 ( 2015 - 06 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> August 27 , 2015 ( 2015 - 08 - 27 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> </Td> <Td_colspan="2"> 13 </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> April 21 , 2016 ( 2016 - 04 - 21 ) </Td> <Td> July 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 07 - 14 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> </Td> <Td_colspan="2"> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> December 8 , 2016 ( 2016 - 12 - 08 ) </Td> <Td> February 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 02 - 09 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> </Td> <Td_colspan="2"> 11 </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> June 15 , 2017 ( 2017 - 06 - 15 ) </Td> <Td> August 17 , 2017 ( 2017 - 08 - 17 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> 5 </Td> <Td_colspan="2"> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan="1"> June 14 , 2018 ( 2018 - 06 - 14 ) </Td> <Td> August 16 , 2018 ( 2018 - 08 - 16 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Series overview ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first season premiered on June 18 , 2015 . It was won by Alan Kay , who lost over 60 pounds during the course of the season . His staple foods were limpets and seaweed . He also consumed mussels , crab , fish and slugs . Lucas Miller enjoyed his time on the show and was selected based on his work as a wilderness therapist . His most difficult experience with the show was making honest confessions to the camera . Sam Larson described his time on the show as `` playing in the woods '' . He set a goal for himself to last 50 days . After he reached his goal , a large storm hit the island , which Larson described as being larger than any he had seen and prompting his decision to leave the island . Larson said that the loneliness and solitude took the most time to adjust to , and that his preparation for the show mostly consisted of mental preparation . </P> Location ( edit ) Quatsino Location of Quatsino in British Columbia <P> The season was shot in Quatsino Territory , located near Port Hardy , British Columbia . </P> <P> Quatsino is a small hamlet of 91 people located on Quatsino Sound in Northern Vancouver Island , Canada , only accessible by boat or float plane . Its nearest neighbour is Coal Harbour , to the east , about 20 minutes away by boat , and Port Alice , to the south , about 40 minutes away by boat . The largest town in the region , Port Hardy , is located about an hour northeast by boat and vehicle . </P> Contestants ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Age </Th> <Th> Gender </Th> <Th> Hometown </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Status </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Alan Kay </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Blairsville , Georgia </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Winner - 56 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sam Larson </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Lincoln , Nebraska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 55 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mitch Mitchell </Td> <Td> 34 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Bellingham , Massachusetts </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 43 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Lucas Miller </Td> <Td> 32 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Quasqueton , Iowa </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 39 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dustin Feher </Td> <Td> 37 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 8 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brant McGee </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Albemarle , North Carolina </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 6 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wayne Russell </Td> <Td> 46 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Saint John , New Brunswick </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 4 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Joe Robinet </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Windsor , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 4 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Chris Weatherman </Td> <Td> 41 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Umatilla , Florida </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 2 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Josh Chavez </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Jackson , Ohio </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 1 day </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 2 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Season 2 began on April 21 , 2016 .

The winner , Zachary Fowler , had lost 70 lbs ( a third of his starting body weight ) before the end of his stay . The person who stayed the second - longest , Carleigh Fairchild , was pulled out because , at 101 lbs , she had lost nearly 30 % of her starting body weight and had a BMI of 16.8 . Participants were automatically `` pulled '' at a BMI of 17 or less . The fourth longest stayer , Dave Nessia , was pulled out when , due to inadequate caloric intake , his systolic pressure barely exceeded his diastolic pressure ( 80 / 60 mmHg ) , putting him in danger of death due to inadequate perfusion of the internal organs . </P> Location ( edit ) Location of Lakes Soberania , Montes and Escondido in Patagonia , Argentina <P> The third season was set in Patagonia , Argentina , in South America . The contestants were spread across multiple lakes in the foothills of the Andes mountain range . Unlike in seasons 1 and 2 , which were located on the Pacific Ocean , season 3 's food resources were mostly limited to brook and rainbow trout , forage , small birds , and the possibility of wild boar . Contestants also were at a disadvantage because they had no access to the flotsam and jetsam that washes up on the Pacific Coast . They also had no salt source . </P> <P> The weather in Patagonia is comparable to that of Vancouver Island , with rainfall averaging 78 inches a year . However , unlike Vancouver Island , snowfall is extremely common in the winter . </P> <P> Predators in Patagonia include wild boar and puma . </P> Contestants ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Age </Th> <Th> Gender </Th> <Th> Hometown </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Status </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Zachary Fowler </Td> <Td> 36 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Appleton , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Winner - 87 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Carleigh Fairchild </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Edna Bay , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 86 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Megan Hanacek </Td> <Td> 41 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Port McNeill , British Columbia </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 78 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dave Nessia </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Salt Lake City , Utah </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 73 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Callie North </Td> <Td> 27 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Lopez Island , Washington </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 72 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Greg Ovens </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Canal Flats , British Columbia </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 51 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Wowak </Td> <Td> 34 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Mahanoy City , Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 51 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Britt Ahart </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Mantua , Ohio </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 35 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Zachary Gault </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Caledon , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 8 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jim Shields </Td> <Td> 37 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Langhorne , Pennsylvania </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 3 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Officially titled `` Alone : Lost & Found '' , the fourth season premiered on June 8 , 2017 . </P> Location ( edit ) Quatsino Location of Quatsino in British Columbia <P> The fourth season was again set on Vancouver Island , in Quatsino Territory , located near Port Hardy , British Columbia . </P> Contestants ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Team </Th> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Age </Th> <Th> Gender </Th> <Th> Hometown </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Status </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Baird ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Jim Baird * </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Toronto , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 10 Winners - 75 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ted Baird </Td> <Td> 32 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Toronto , Ontario </Td> <Td> Canada </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brockdorff ( father / son ) </Td> <Td> Pete Brockdorff † </Td> <Td> 61 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Poolesville , Maryland </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 9 Tap out - 74 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sam Brockdorff * </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Poolesville , Maryland </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Whipple ( husband / wife ) </Td> <Td> Brooke Whipple † </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> Female </Td> <Td> Fox , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 9 Tap out - 49 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dave Whipple * </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wilkes ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Chris Wilkes † </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Hattiesburg , Mississippi </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> Linked up - day 8 Tap out - 14 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brody Wilkes * </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Kentwood , Louisiana </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bosdell ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Shannon Bosdell † </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Wrangell , Alaska </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 5 days ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jesse Bosdell * </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Skowhegan , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ribar ( father / son ) </Td> <Td> Alex Ribar * </Td> <Td> 48 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Montville , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 2 days </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Logan Ribar † </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Liberty , Maine </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Richardson ( brothers ) </Td> <Td> Brad Richardson * </Td> <Td> 23 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox Lake , Illinois </Td> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> 1 day ( medically evacuated ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Josh Richardson † </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> Male </Td> <Td> Fox Lake , Illinois </Td> <Td> United States </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> * hiking team member ( other team member sets up camp ) </P> <P> † team member who tapped out </P> <H3> Season 5 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Officially titled `` Alone : Redemption '' , Season 5 premiered on June 14 , 2018 .
