Her first public singing performances were with her two sisters in a Nebraska church when she was eight years old . After the trio won a national talent search run by Horace Heidt , they moved to Los Angeles to seek work in the music industry . </P> <P> At the age of 13 , Ward was hired by Los Angeles television station KTLA to sing on a Your Hit Parade - like program , Bandstand Revue ; Ward performed popular hits for four years . Then she started a career of singing on demo and released recordings . One 1962 session was singing the `` la la la '' parts in Pat Boone 's `` Speedy Gonzales '' , which became a million - selling single . ( Elton John said the `` hook '' in his best - selling single `` Crocodile Rock '' was inspired by Ward 's `` Speedy Gonzales '' vocal . ) </P> <H3> `` Wonderful Summer '' ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1963 , songwriter - producer Perry Botkin Jr. hired Jackie Ward to make a demo recording of `` Wonderful Summer '' , a song he wrote with co-writer and co-producer Gil Garfield . The purpose of a demo is to persuade `` name '' singers to record a song by demonstrating how it might be done . After recording Ward 's vocal at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles , Botkin thought it might sound better if her voice was higher - pitched , so he sped up the recording by wrapping splicing tape around the capstan of the machine . Botkin realized the finished recording , with bird and surf sound effects added , was good enough to release as a pop music single . But because the sped - up singing sounded younger than 21 - year - old Jackie Ward , she suggested using her daughter 's first name Robin on the record label . That fall , `` Wonderful Summer '' was released by Dot Records as a 45rpm single . Sales exceeded one million copies in the United States , propelling the record to # 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart of December 14 -- 21 , 1963 . </P> <P> An album followed , with limited success . Jackie Ward made additional `` Robin Ward '' recordings , including a duet with radio DJ Wink Martindale , another Dot Records artist . In 1964 Ward released the single `` Winter 's Here '' , which reached # 123 on the Billboard chart . Because `` Wonderful Summer '' is her only Hot 100 hit , the singer named Robin Ward is considered a one - hit - wonder . However , while the public did not know Jackie 's real name , many of her other recordings were and still are widely heard . </P> <H3> Post `` Robin Ward '' TV , movies , and records singing ( edit ) </H3> <P> As her young - sounding Robin Ward records were disappearing from radio play , Jackie Ward 's grown - up singing career was expanding . At times in 1960s - 1970s she could be heard almost everywhere . </P> <P> In the early to mid-1960s Jackie was one of the singers on The Red Skelton Show and The Danny Kaye Show , and later , on The Carol Burnett Show . In the 1970s she sang on The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour . </P> <P> Ward sang in hundreds of commercials , most notably for Rice - a-Roni ( `` The San Francisco treat '' ) . </P> <P> Ward 's voice is heard in dozens of television theme songs , including Flipper , Batman , Love , American Style , Maude ( with Donny Hathaway providing the lead vocal ) , and The Partridge Family . </P> <P> By her own estimate , Ward 's voice can be heard in `` maybe 800 '' films . Among the notable are her voice dubbed as Natalie Wood singing Academy Award - nominated song `` Sweetheart Tree '' from movie The Great Race , as Wood in Inside Daisy Clover , and as Janet Leigh in An American Dream . Ward is the singing voice of Cindy Bear in Hey There , It 's Yogi Bear ! , and the Singer in Charlotte 's Web . In 1965 movie Beach Blanket Bingo , Ward sings `` New Love '' and `` Fly Boy '' , lip - synched by actor Linda Evans . </P> <P> Along with her TV , movie and advertising singing , Ward is heard on hundreds of pop recordings , including backing Barbra Streisand on `` Stoney End '' . and other major recording artists including Nat King Cole , Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra , Gordon Lightfoot , the Carpenters , Cass Elliot , and Joan Baez . Ward did broadcast recordings of musicals Hair , Grease , Annie , and Hello Dolly . Ward sang a duet with Allan Sherman on his song Here 's To the Crabgrass from his 1963 comedy album My Son The Nut . In 1967 , she sang on Gábor Szabó 's album for Impulse ! , Wind , Sky And Diamonds , as a member of The California Dreamers . </P> <P> Ward also sang alto in vocal groups heard on many hit records and popular albums , including the Anita Kerr Singers and the Ron Hicklin Singers ( who anonymously made many hit records beyond the Partridge Family ) . As a member of the Ray Conniff Singers , Ward recorded several lead and solo vocals . </P> <H3> The Partridge Family ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ward 's longest - lasting contribution might be The Partridge Family TV show and hit records , where she is heard but not seen or identified . Other than show star David Cassidy ( and star Shirley Jones on a couple of songs ) , none of the actors participated in singing or playing the songs ; on camera they lip - synced and pretended to play instruments while the soundtrack is actually recordings by session musicians . Ward was in the Ron Hicklin Singers vocal group , along with brothers John Bahler and Tom Bahler , and Ron Hicklin . With Cassidy singing lead , this group did all the TV show performances and records credited to the Partridge Family ( along with session instrumental musicians who became known as the Wrecking Crew ) . Since the public did not know who really created the many Partridge Family songs that became big hits , Ward again was anonymous . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` An Interview with Jackie Ward , part 1 '' . www.cmongethappy.com . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Crocodile Rock by Elton John Songfacts '' . www.songfacts.com . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Spectropop , Friends of . `` Spectropop Group Discussion Archives : Digest Number 40 - 19 Sep 2000 '' . www.spectropop.com . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Digital Videos - Episodes ( TV Series ) - VH1 '' .
