Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as one of the greatest players of all time , Ronaldo has a record - tying five Ballon d'Or awards , the most for a European player , and is the first player to win four European Golden Shoes . He has won 26 trophies in his career , including five league titles , five UEFA Champions League titles and one UEFA European Championship . A prolific goalscorer , Ronaldo holds the records for most official goals scored in Europe 's top - five leagues ( 395 ) , the UEFA Champions League ( 120 ) , the UEFA European Championship ( 9 ) , as well as those for most assists in the UEFA Champions League ( 34 ) and the UEFA European Championship ( 6 ) . He has scored over 670 senior career goals for club and country . </P> <P> Born and raised on the Portuguese island of Madeira , Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart at age 15 . He underwent an operation to treat his condition , and began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP , before signing with Manchester United at age 18 in 2003 . After winning his first trophy , the FA Cup , during his first season in England , he helped United win three successive Premier League titles , a UEFA Champions League title , and a FIFA Club World Cup . By age 22 , he had received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations and at age 23 , he won his first Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards . In 2009 , Ronaldo was the subject of the most expensive association football transfer when he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer worth € 94 million ( £ 80 million ) . </P> <P> In Madrid , Ronaldo won 15 trophies , including two La Liga titles , two Copas del Rey , four UEFA Champions League titles , two UEFA Super Cups , and three FIFA Club World Cups. Real Madrid 's all - time top goalscorer , Ronaldo scored a record 34 La Liga hat - tricks , including a record - tying eight hat - tricks in the 2014 -- 15 season and is the only player to reach 30 goals in six consecutive La Liga seasons . After joining Madrid , Ronaldo finished runner - up for the Ballon d'Or three times , behind Lionel Messi , his perceived career rival , before winning back - to - back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014 . After winning the 2016 and 2017 Champions Leagues , Ronaldo secured back - to - back Ballons d'Or again in 2016 and 2017 . A historic third consecutive Champions League followed , making Ronaldo the first player to win the trophy five times . In 2018 , he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth € 100 million , the highest fee ever paid for a player over 30 years old , and the highest ever paid by an Italian club . </P> <P> A Portuguese international , Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation in 2015 . He made his senior debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18 , and has since had over 150 caps , including appearing and scoring in eight major tournaments , becoming Portugal 's most capped player and his country 's all - time top goalscorer . He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 and helped Portugal reach the final . He took over full captaincy in July 2008 , leading Portugal to their first - ever triumph in a major tournament by winning Euro 2016 , and received the Silver Boot as the second - highest goalscorer of the tournament , before becoming the highest European international goalscorer of all - time . One of the most marketable athletes in the world , he was ranked the world 's highest - paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 , as well as the world 's most famous athlete by ESPN in 2016 , 2017 and 2018 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Club career <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Sporting CP </Li> <Li> 2.2 Manchester United <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 2003 -- 07 : Development and breakthrough </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 2007 -- 09 : Collective and individual success </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.3 Real Madrid <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 2009 -- 13 : World record transfer and La Liga championship </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 2013 -- 15 : Consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins and La Décima </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 2015 -- 17 : All - time Real Madrid top scorer and La Undécima </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 2017 -- 18 : A record fifth Champions League title and fifth Ballon d'Or </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.4 Juventus <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 2018 -- 19 </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 International career <Ul> <Li> 3.1 2001 -- 07 : Youth level and early international career </Li> <Li> 3.2 2007 -- 12 : Assuming the captaincy </Li> <Li> 3.3 2012 -- 16 : All - time Portugal top scorer and European champion </Li> <Li> 3.4 2016 -- present : Post-European Championship victory , and World Cup </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Player profile <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Style of play </Li> <Li> 4.2 Reception </Li> <Li> 4.3 Comparisons to Lionel Messi </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Outside football </Li> <Li> 6 Personal life <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Family and relationships </Li> <Li> 6.2 Philanthropy </Li> <Li> 6.3 Controversies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Career statistics <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Club </Li> <Li> 7.2 International </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Honours and achievements <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Club </Li> <Li> 8.2 International </Li> <Li> 8.3 Individual <Ul> <Li> 8.3. 1 Awards </Li> <Li> 8.3. 2 Performances </Li> <Li> 8.3. 3 Orders </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8.4 Records <Ul> <Li> 8.4. 1 World </Li> <Li> 8.4. 2 Continental </Li> <Li> 8.4. 3 Spain </Li> <Li> 8.4. 4 Portugal </Li> <Li> 8.4. 5 Real Madrid </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Further reading </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early life </H2> <P> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro , Funchal , Portugal and grew up in the Funchal parish of Santo António , as the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro , a cook , and José Dinis Aveiro , a municipal gardener and a part - time kit man . His second given name , `` Ronaldo '' , was chosen after then - U.S. president Ronald Reagan . He has one older brother , Hugo , and two older sisters , Elma and Liliana Cátia . His great - grandmother on his father 's side , Isabel da Piedade , was from São Vicente , Cape Verde . Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home , sharing a room with his brother and sisters . </P> <P> As a child , Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha from 1992 to 1995 , where his father was the kit man , and later spent two years with Nacional . In 1997 , aged 12 , he went on a three - day trial with Sporting CP , who signed him for a fee of £ 1,500 . He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete , near Lisbon , to join Sporting 's other youth players at the club 's football academy . By age 14 , Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally , and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football . While popular with other students at school , he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher , who he said had `` disrespected '' him . However , one year later , he was diagnosed with a racing heart , a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football . Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways , altering his resting heart rate . He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later . </P> <H2> Club career </H2> <H3> Sporting CP </H3> Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP 's museum <P> At age 16 , Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting 's youth team by first - team manager László Bölöni , who was impressed with his dribbling . He subsequently became the first player to play for the club 's under - 16 , under - 17 and under - 18 teams , the B team , and the first team , all within a single season . A year later , on 7 October 2002 , Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga , against Moreirense , and scored two goals in their 3 -- 0 win . Over the course of the 2002 -- 03 season , his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta . Manager Arsène Wenger , who was interested in signing the winger , met with him at Arsenal 's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer . </P> <P> Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson , however , determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently , after Sporting defeated United 3 -- 1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003 . Initially , United had just planned to sign Ronaldo and then loan him back to Sporting for a year . Having impressed the Manchester United players , however , they urged Ferguson to sign him . After the game , Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £ 12.24 million for what he considered to be `` one of the most exciting young players '' he had ever seen . A decade after his departure from the club , in April 2013 , Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000 th member . </P> <H3> Manchester United </H3> 2003 -- 07 : development and breakthrough <P> Ronaldo became Manchester United 's first - ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003 -- 04 season . His transfer fee of £ 12.24 million made him , at the time , the most expensive teenager in English football history . Although he requested the number 28 , his number at Sporting , he received the number 7 shirt , which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best , Eric Cantona and David Beckham . Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo . A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager , Alex Ferguson , of whom he later said , `` He 's been my father in sport , one of the most important and influential factors in my career . '' </P> <P> Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4 -- 0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003 , receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th - minute substitute for Nicky Butt . His performance earned praise from George Best , who hailed it as `` undoubtedly the most exciting debut '' he had ever seen . Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free - kick in a 3 -- 0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November . Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign , the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season , a match in which he also received his first red card . Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United 's 3 -- 0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final , earning his first trophy . </P> Ronaldo playing against Chelsea in the Premier League during his third season in England <P> At the start of 2005 , Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004 -- 05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal . He played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against Arsenal in the FA Cup final , which ended in a goalless draw , and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout . He scored Manchester United 's 1000th Premier League goal on 29 October , their only strike in a 4 -- 1 loss to Middlesbrough . Midway through the season , in November , he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010 . Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football , the Football League Cup , after scoring the third goal in United 's 4 -- 0 final victory over Wigan Athletic . </P> <P> During his third season in England , Ronaldo was involved in several incidents . He had a one - match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a `` one - fingered gesture '' towards Benfica fans , and was sent off in the Manchester derby -- a 3 -- 1 defeat -- for kicking Manchester City 's former United player Andy Cole . Ronaldo clashed with a teammate , striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who took offence at the winger 's showboating style of play . Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup , in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off , Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer , lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident . United , however , denied the possibility of him leaving the club . </P> <P> Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006 -- 07 season , it proved to be his breakout year , as he broke the 20 - goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title . An important factor in this success was his one - to - one training by first - team coach René Meulensteen , who taught him to make himself more unpredictable , improve his teamwork , call for the ball , and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known . He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December , against Aston Villa -- a victory which put United on top of the league -- Wigan Athletic , and Reading . Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December , becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours . </P> 2007 -- 09 : collective and individual success Ronaldo during the 2006 -- 07 season <P> At the quarter - final stage of the 2006 -- 07 UEFA Champions League , Ronaldo scored his first - ever goals in the competition , finding the net twice in a 7 -- 1 victory over Roma . He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan , which ended in a 3 -- 2 win , but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3 -- 0 at the San Siro . He also helped United reach the FA Cup final , but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1 -- 0 defeat . Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007 -- his 50th goal for the club -- as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years . As a result of his performances , he amassed a host of personal awards for the season . He won the Professional Footballers ' Association 's Player 's Player , Fans ' Player , and Young Player of the Year awards , as well as the Football Writers ' Association 's Footballer of the Year award , becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours . His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £ 120,000 a week ( £ 31 million total ) as part of a five - year contract extension with United . </P> <P> Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007 -- 08 season , his most prolific campaign during his time in England . He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season , an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him . At the end of 2007 , Ronaldo was named runner - up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or , and came third , behind Kaká and Lionel Messi , in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award . </P> <P> Ronaldo scored his first and only hat - trick for Manchester United in a 6 -- 0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008 , bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table . A month later , on 19 March , he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton , and scored both goals of the match . His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign , which bettered George Best 's total of 32 goals in the 1967 -- 68 season , thus setting the club 's new single - season record by a midfielder . His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot , as well as the European Golden Shoe , which made him the first winger to win the latter award . </P> Ronaldo taking a direct free kick against Celtic in the 2008 -- 09 UEFA Champions League <P> In the knockout stage of the Champions League , Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon , which helped United advance to the quarter - finals 2 -- 1 on aggregate , and , while playing as a striker , scored with a header in the 3 -- 0 aggregate victory over Roma . United advanced to the final against Chelsea in Moscow , where , despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty being saved in the shoot - out , Manchester United emerged victorious . As the Champions League top scorer , Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year . He additionally received the PFA Players ' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season . </P> <P> As rumours circulated of Ronaldo 's interest in moving to Real Madrid , United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid 's alleged pursuit of their player , but they declined to take action . FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club , describing the situation as `` modern slavery '' . Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter , he remained at United for another year . Ahead of the 2008 -- 09 season , on 7 July , he underwent ankle surgery , which kept him out of action for 10 weeks . Following his return , he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5 -- 0 win against Stoke City on 15 November , which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time . At the close of 2008 , Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan , assisting the final - winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process . He subsequently became United 's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968 , and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year . </P> <P> His match - winning goal in the second leg against Porto , a 40 - yard strike , earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award , presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year ; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored . United advanced to the final in Rome , where he made little impact in United 's 2 -- 0 defeat to Barcelona . Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies , as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a Football League Cup . He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions , 16 goals fewer than the previous season , in four more appearances . His final ever goal for Manchester United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford . </P> <H3> Real Madrid </H3> 2009 -- 13 : World record transfer and La Liga Championship <P> Ahead of the 2009 -- 10 season , Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time , of £ 80 million ( € 94 million ) . His contract , which ran until 2015 , was worth € 11 million per year and contained a € 1 billion buy - out clause . At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu , surpassing the 25 - year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli . Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 , the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United , Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt , which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano . </P> As his usual number 7 was unavailable , Ronaldo wore number 9 during his first season at Madrid . Following Raúl 's departure , Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010 -- 11 season . <P> Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009 , against Deportivo La Coruña , and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid 's 3 -- 2 home win . He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club , the first Madrid player to do so . His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich . His strong start to the season , however , was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty , which kept him sidelined for seven weeks . A week after his return , he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería . Midway through the season , Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award , behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona , Madrid 's historic rivals . He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions , including a hat - trick in a 4 -- 1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010 , his first in the Spanish competition . His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless . </P> <P> Following Raúl 's departure , Ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for Real Madrid before the 2010 -- 11 season . His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or - winning form was epitomised when , for the first time in his career , he scored four goals in a single match during a 6 -- 1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October . His haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matches -- three in La Liga , one in the Champions League , and two for Portugal -- totalling 11 goals , the most he had scored in a single month . Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat - tricks against Athletic Bilbao , Levante , Villarreal , and Málaga . Despite his performance , he failed to make the podium for the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or at the end of 2010 . </P> <P> During a historical series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011 , Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season . Although he failed to find the net during Madrid 's eventual elimination in the Champions League semi-finals , he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match - winning goal in the 103rd minute of the Copa del Rey final , winning his first trophy in Spain . Over the next two weeks , Ronaldo scored another four - goal haul against Sevilla , a hat - trick against Getafe , and a brace of free kicks against Villarreal , taking his league total to 38 goals , which equalled the record for most goals scored in a season held by Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez . His two goals in the last match of the season , against Almería , made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals . In addition to the Pichichi Trophy , Ronaldo consequently won the European Golden Shoe for a second time , becoming the first player to win the award in two different leagues . He ended his second season at Real Madrid with a total of 53 goals in all competitions . </P> Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain . <P> During the following campaign , the 2011 -- 12 season , Ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions . His 100th goal for Real Madrid came at Camp Nou in the Supercopa de España , though Barcelona claimed the trophy 5 -- 4 on aggregate . He regained a place on the FIFA Ballon d'Or podium , as runner - up to Messi , after scoring hat - tricks against Real Zaragoza , Rayo Vallecano , Málaga , Osasuna , and Sevilla , the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season 's midway point . Despite two goals from Ronaldo , Madrid were subsequently defeated by Barcelona 4 -- 3 on aggregrate in the quarter - finals of the Copa del Rey . He again scored twice , including a penalty , in the Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich , resulting in a 3 -- 3 draw , but his penalty kick in the shootout was saved by Manuel Neuer , leading to Madrid 's elimination . </P> <P> Ronaldo found greater team success in the league , as he helped Real Madrid win their first La Liga title in four years , with a record 100 points . Following a hat - trick against Levante , further increasing Madrid 's lead over Barcelona , he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5 -- 1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012 , a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons , breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás . Another hat - trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals , equalling his record of the previous season . His final league goal of the campaign , against Mallorca , took his total to 46 goals , four short of the new record set by Messi , and earned him the distinction of being the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season in La Liga . </P> <P> Ronaldo began the 2012 -- 13 season by lifting the Supercopa de España , his third trophy in Spain . With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese , Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4 -- 4 aggregate draw against Barcelona . Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a `` professional issue '' within the club , prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid , his goalscoring rate did not suffer . After netting a hat - trick , including two penalties , against Deportivo La Coruña , he scored his first hat - trick in the Champions League in a 4 -- 1 victory over Ajax . Four days later , he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2 -- 2 draw at Camp Nou . His performances in 2012 again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the FIFA Ballon d'Or , finishing runner - up to four - time winner Messi . </P> 2013 -- 15 : consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins and La Décima <P> Following the 2012 -- 13 winter break , Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the first time in an official match , scoring a brace to lift 10 - man Madrid to a 4 -- 3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January . He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January , a match which also marked his 500th club appearance .

In the final , he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2 -- 1 defeat to Atlético Madrid , but was shown a straight red card in the 114th minute for violent conduct . Real Madrid also failed to defend their La Liga title , finishing runners up to Barcelona . </P> <P> In the first knockout round of the Champions League , Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time . After scoring the equaliser in a 1 -- 1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu , he scored the match - winning goal in a 2 -- 1 victory at Old Trafford , his first return to his former home ground . Ronaldo scored three goals in Madrid 's 5 -- 3 aggregate victory over Galatasaray to see them advance to the semi-finals , He scored Madrid 's only goal in the 4 -- 1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund , but failed to increase his side 's 2 -- 0 victory in the second leg , as they were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year . Ronaldo had scored 12 goals , finishing as the Champions League top goalscorer for a second time in his career . Accounting for all competitions , he ended the season with a total of 55 goals . </P> Ronaldo scored a record 17 goals during the 2013 -- 14 La Décima campaign . <P> Real Madrid 's failure to win major silverware and reports of division among the players prompted speculation regarding Ronaldo 's future at the club . At the start of the 2013 -- 14 season , however , he signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018 , with a salary of € 17 million net , making him briefly the highest - paid player in football . He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale , whose world record transfer fee of € 100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior . Together with striker Karim Benzema , they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed `` BBC '' , an acronym of Bale , Benzema , and Cristiano , and a play off the name of the public service broadcaster . After enjoying a strong goalscoring run during the first half of the campaign , Ronaldo suggested that he was in the best form of his career . By late November , he had scored 32 goals from 22 matches played for both club and country , including hat - tricks against Galatasaray , Sevilla , Real Sociedad , Northern Ireland , and Sweden . He ended 2013 with a total of 69 goals in 59 appearances , his highest year - end goal tally . His efforts earned him the FIFA Ballon d'Or , an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award , for the first time in his career . </P> <P> Concurrently with his individual achievements , Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date , as he helped Real Madrid win La Décima , their tenth European Cup . In the knockout phase of the competition , he scored a brace in each leg of a 9 -- 2 aggregate win against Schalke 04 , helping Madrid advance to the quarter - finals . His goal in a 3 -- 0 home win over Borussia Dortmund -- his 100th Champions League match -- took his total for the season to 14 goals , equalling the record Messi had set two years before . After hitting a brace in a 4 -- 0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena , he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4 -- 1 final victory over Atlético Madrid , becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams . His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems , which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign . Ronaldo played the final against medical advice , later commenting : `` In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks . '' As the Champions League top goalscorer for the third time , with a record 17 goals , he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe . </P> <P> In the Copa del Rey , Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring a brace of penalties against Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón , the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90 - minute football match . His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final , where Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2 -- 1 to claim the trophy . While Madrid were less successful in La Liga , finishing third , Ronaldo was unmatched as a goalscorer . He scored 31 goals in 30 league games , which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe , receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez . Among his haul was his 400th career goal , in 653 appearances for club and country , which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January ; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio , who had died two days before . A last - minute , backheeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May -- his 50th goal in all competitions -- was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional , which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga . </P> <P> During the next campaign , the 2014 -- 15 season , Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals in all competitions , starting with both goals in Real Madrid 's 2 -- 0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup . He subsequently achieved his best - ever goalscoring start to a league campaign , with a record 15 goals in the first eight rounds of La Liga , including a four - goal haul against Elche and hat - tricks against Deportivo La Coruña and Athletic Bilbao . His record 23rd hat - trick in La Liga , scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December , made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in the Spanish league , as he reached the milestone in only his 178th game . After lifting the FIFA Club World Cup with Madrid in Morocco , again winning the Silver Ball , Ronaldo received a second successive FIFA Ballon d'Or , joining Johan Cruyff , Michel Platini , and Marco van Basten as a three - time Ballon d'Or winner . </P> 2015 -- 17 : all - time Real Madrid top scorer and La Undécima Ronaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions during the 2014 -- 15 season . <P> Following the winter break , Ronaldo 's form faltered , concurrently with a decline in performance by his team . A 2 -- 1 defeat against Valencia in the first match of 2015 , despite his opening goal , ended Real Madrid 's Spanish record winning streak of 22 matches in all competitions . Their season continued unsuccessfully as they failed to win a major trophy , earning a second - place league finish and a semi-final exit in Europe . In the latter competition , Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2 -- 0 win against Schalke 04 , before hitting a brace in the 3 -- 4 return defeat that allowed Madrid to progress to the quarter - finals . He then scored both of his side 's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus , where Madrid were eliminated 2 -- 3 on aggregate . With 10 goals , he finished the campaign as top scorer for a third consecutive season , alongside Messi and Neymar . </P> <P> In La Liga , where Madrid finished second , Ronaldo went on a prolific goalscoring run towards the very end of the season . For the first time in his career , he scored five goals in one game , including an eight - minute hat - trick , in a 9 -- 1 rout of Granada on 5 April . His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2 -- 0 win against Rayo Vallecano . Subsequent hat - tricks against Sevilla , Espanyol , and Getafe took his number of hat - tricks for Real Madrid to 31 , surpassing Di Stéfano 's club record of 28 trebles . As a result , Ronaldo finished the season with 48 goals , two ahead of his total in the 2011 -- 12 season , despite having missed two matches in February for assaulting a Córdoba player . In addition to a second consecutive Pichichi , he won the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time . </P> <P> At the start of his seventh season at Real Madrid , the 2015 -- 16 campaign , Ronaldo became the club 's all - time top scorer , first in the league and then in all competitions . His five - goal haul in a 6 -- 0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games , surpassing the club 's previous recordholder , Raúl . A month later , on 17 October , he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3 -- 0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals . Ronaldo also became the all - time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat - trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk , having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals . A brace against Malmö FF , scoring in a 2 -- 0 away win on 30 September , saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for both club and country . He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition 's group stage , setting the record at 11 goals , including another four - goal haul against Malmö . </P> By March 2016 , Ronaldo had scored 252 goals in 228 matches in La Liga to become the competition 's second - highest scorer . <P> Despite finishing runner - up to Messi for the FIFA Ballon d'Or , Ronaldo received criticism for his form and performances against top teams , with 14 of his goals coming against Espanyol and Malmö . However , during the second half of the season , his form gradually improved . By scoring four goals in a 7 -- 1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 , Ronaldo arrived at 252 goals in La Liga to become the competition 's second - highest scorer in history behind Messi . After netting the match - winning goal for 10 - man Madrid in a 2 -- 1 Clásico victory on 2 April , he scored a hat - trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals despite a 2 -- 0 first - leg defeat . The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals , making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season , and the fifth overall . Suffering apparent fitness issues , Ronaldo gave a poorly - received performance in the final against Atlético Madrid , in a repeat of the 2014 final , though his penalty in the subsequent shoot - out secured La Undécima , Madrid 's 11th victory . For the sixth successive year , he ended the season having scored more than 50 goals across all competitions . For his efforts during the season , he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time . </P> <P> Ronaldo missed Real Madrid 's first three matches of the 2016 -- 17 season , including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla , as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the final of Euro 2016 .

As a result of the penalty scored by Ronaldo , Real Madrid reached its 5,900 th goal in the history of the league and became the first team to do so . On 12 April , in the 2016 -- 17 UEFA Champions League quarter - final against Bayern Munich , Ronaldo scored two goals in a 2 -- 1 away win to give Madrid the win and the lead going into the second leg . The two goals saw him make history in becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition .

Having received a yellow card for taking his shirt off during his goal celebration , he was sent off for a second yellow card offence minutes later before he shoved the referee lightly to depict his dissatisfaction . He was issued a five - match suspension following the match . In his 400th game for Real Madrid , Ronaldo scored two goals away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League , taking his club tally to 411 goals .

The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old , and the highest ever paid by an Italian club .

During the tournament , he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal 's second match of the group stage . In the quarter - finals against England , his Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho . Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney 's infraction , the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining , after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal 's bench following Rooney 's dismissal . Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the penalty shoot out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals . Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1 -- 0 semi-final defeat to France .

On 30 June , Portugal were eliminated following a 2 -- 1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16 . </P> <H2> Player Profile </H2> <H3> Style of play </H3> Ronaldo in action for Real Madrid against Espanyol during the 2012 -- 13 season <P> A versatile attacker , Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch , and , while ostensibly right - footed , is very strong with both feet . He ranks among the world 's fastest footballers , both with and without the ball . Tactically , Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career . While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United , he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield , where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area . In this position , he was able to use his pace and acceleration , agility , and technical skills to take on opponents in one - on - one situations . Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair , often displaying an array of tricks and feints , such as the step overs that became his trademark . </P> Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010 -- 11 La Liga game against Almería <P> As Ronaldo matured , he underwent a major physical transformation , developing a muscular body type that allows him to retain possession of the ball . His strength , combined with his elevation and height of 1.85 m ( 6 ft 1 in ) , gives him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls . These attributes allow him to function as a target - man , and makes him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area ; consequently , many of his goals have been headers . Allied with his increased stamina and work - rate , his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks . He also increasingly played a creative role for his team , often dropping deep to pick up the ball , participate in the build - up of plays , and create chances for his teammates , courtesy of his good vision and passing ability . </P> Pictured during El Clásico in 2011 , Ronaldo in his familiar pose before striking a free kick <P> In his final seasons at United , Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role , functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward , or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion . He developed into a prolific goalscorer , capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot , courtesy of his striking ability . An accurate penalty kick taker , he also became a set piece specialist , renowned for his powerful , bending free kicks , though his ability in this regard deteriorated later on in his career . </P> <P> At Real Madrid , Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role , while his creative and defensive duties became more limited , although not entirely diminished . Initially deployed as a centre forward , he was later moved back onto the left wing , though in a free tactical role ; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score , or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit . Madrid 's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player , as evidenced by his record - breaking goalscoring feats . However , while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring , he also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role . From 2013 onwards , he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off - the - ball movement and general involvement , completing fewer dribbles and passes per game , and instead focusing on short - distance creating and goalscoring . Since 2017 , Ronaldo has adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free - roaming centre forward , a role in which he has continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record ; in this position , he has earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement , excellent positional sense , link - up play , clinical finishing , and opportunism , as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers , find space in the box , and score from few opportunities . </P> <H3> Reception </H3> `` In the six years ( Manchester United ) had him , you just saw his game grow all the time , and he was a fantastic player . Now you see the complete player . His decision - making , his maturity , his experience , plus all the great skills he has got , they all make him the complete player . '' <P> -- Former manager Alex Ferguson , January 2013 </P> <P> Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation , alongside Lionel Messi . Ronaldo quickly established himself among the world 's best players in his early 20s , featuring as the core component for Manchester United in the mid-to - late 2000s . However , after winning his first Ballon d'Or by a record - high vote count at age 23 , the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history . Universally acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goalscoring ability , he is considered a decisive player , who stands out in games and who can be a game changer , especially in important and high - pressured situations . Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic , elite body conditioning , and dedication to improvement on the training pitch , as well being regarded as a natural leader . His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring . </P> <P> Ronaldo has at times , however , been criticised for simulating when tackled . In addition to this , he was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson , teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player . </P> <P> During his career , Ronaldo has also been described as having an `` arrogant image '' on the pitch , with Ronaldo stating that he had become a `` victim '' , because of how he was portrayed in the media . He is often seen moaning , gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory , with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance . His managers , teammates and various journalists have commented that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him . In 2014 , Ronaldo told France Football that he had made a `` mistake '' when he said in 2011 , `` People are jealous of me as I am young , handsome and rich '' , adding that he had matured since then and fans understood him better . </P> <H3> Comparisons to Lionel Messi </H3> Main article : Messi -- Ronaldo rivalry Ronaldo with Lionel Messi before an international friendly between Portugal and Argentina in Geneva , Switzerland , on 9 February 2011 <P> Both players have scored in at least two UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50 - goal barrier in a single season . Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football . It has been compared to sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali -- Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing , the Borg -- McEnroe rivalry in tennis , and the Ayrton Senna -- Alain Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing . </P> `` It 's part of my life now . People are bound to compare us . He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team , as I do , and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent . '' <P> -- Cristiano Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi . </P> <P> Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two , while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players : Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff , while Messi is portrayed as a shy , humble character . </P> <P> In a 2012 interview , Ronaldo commented on the rivalry , saying `` I think we push each other sometimes in the competition , this is why the competition is so high '' , while Ronaldo 's manager during his time at Manchester United , Alex Ferguson , opined that `` I do n't think the rivalry against each other bothers them . I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best '' . Messi himself denied any rivalry , saying that it was `` only the media , the press , who wants us to be at loggerheads but I 've never fought with Cristiano '' . Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level , Ronaldo commented , `` We do n't have a relationship outside the world of football , just as we do n't with a lot of other players '' , before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together , stating ; `` We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit , because it 's a good thing . '' Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid , the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world 's biggest club game , El Clásico , which is among the world 's most viewed annual sporting events . </P> <P> In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013 , when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo , Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo , claiming `` one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other '' . Real Madrid demanded -- and promptly received -- a full apology , and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock - salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla , after Blatter had described him as a `` commander '' on the pitch . </P> <H2> Outside Football </H2> See also : Museu CR7 and Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport The Cristiano Ronaldo Museum , CR7 , in Funchal , Madeira .

At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014 , President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry , `` to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally , contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations '' .

A year later , sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust . However , this bust was never used ; instead , a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor , shown to the public on 15 June 2018 . </P> <H2> Personal life </H2> <H3> Family and relationships </H3> Ronaldo 's children <Ul> <Li> Via a surrogate mother <Ul> <Li> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Junior ( born 2010 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Via a surrogate mother <Ul> <Li> Eva Maria ( born 2017 ) </Li> <Li> Mateo ( born 2017 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> By Georgina Rodriguez <Ul> <Li> Alana Martina ( born 2017 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Ronaldo 's father , José Dinis Aveiro , died of an alcoholism - related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20 .
