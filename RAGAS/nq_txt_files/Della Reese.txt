Her mother had had several children before Reese 's birth , none of whom lived with her ; hence , Reese grew up as an only child . At six years old , Reese began singing in church . From this experience , she became an avid gospel singer . On weekends in the 1940s , she and her mother would go to the movies independently to watch the likes of Joan Crawford , Bette Davis , and Lena Horne portray glamorous lives on screen . Afterwards , Reese would act out the scenes from the films . In 1944 , she began her career directing the young people 's choir , after she had nurtured acting plus her obvious musical talent . She was often chosen , on radio , as a regular singer . At the age of 13 , she was hired to sing with Mahalia Jackson 's gospel group . Delloreese entered Detroit 's popular Cass Technical High School ( where she attended the same year as Edna Rae Gillooly , later known as Ellen Burstyn ) . She also continued with her touring with Jackson . With higher grades , she was the first in her family to graduate from high school in 1947 , at only 15 . </P> <P> Afterwards , she formed her own gospel group , the Meditation Singers . However , due in part to the death of her mother and her father 's serious illness , Reese had to interrupt her schooling at Wayne State University to help support her family . Faithful to the memory of her mother , Delloreese moved out of her father 's house when she disapproved of him taking up with a new girlfriend . She then took on odd jobs , such as truck driver , dental receptionist , and elevator operator , after 1949 . Performing in clubs , Early soon decided to shorten her name from `` Delloreese Early '' to `` Della Reese '' . </P> <H2> Musical career ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

Reese remained there for eight weeks . Although her roots were in gospel music , she now was being exposed to and influenced by such jazz artists as Ella Fitzgerald , Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday . In 1953 , she signed a recording contract with Jubilee Records , for which she recorded six albums . Later that year , she also joined the Hawkins Orchestra . Her first recordings for Jubilee were songs such as `` In the Still of the Night '' ( originally published in 1937 ) , `` I 've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm '' and `` Time After Time '' ( 1947 ) . The songs were later included on the album And That Reminds Me ( 1959 ) . </P> <P> In 1957 , Reese released a single called `` And That Reminds Me '' . After years of performing , she gained chart success with this song . It became a Top Twenty pop hit and a million - seller record . That year , Reese was voted by Billboard , Cashbox and various other magazines , as `` The Most Promising Singer '' . In 1959 , Reese moved to RCA Records and released her first RCA single , called `` Do n't You Know ? , '' which was adapted from Giacomo Puccini 's music for La bohème , specifically , the aria `` Quando m'en vo ' '' ( Musetta 's Waltz ) . It became her biggest hit to date , reaching the number 2 spot on the pop charts and topping the R&B charts ( then called the `` Hot R&B Sides '' ) that year . It sold over one million copies , and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA . Eventually , the song came to be widely considered the signature song of her early career . She then released a successful follow - up single called `` Not One Minute More '' ( number 16 ) . She remained on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with `` And Now '' ( number 69 ) . In 1960 she released `` Someday ( You 'll Want Me to Want You ) '' ( number 56 ) which was drawn from her Grammy - nominated album Della . The album rose in the pop album charts to number 35 . </P> <P> In November 1960 , Reese appeared in advertisements in Ebony magazine for the newly launched AMI Continental jukebox . Reese recorded regularly throughout the 1960s , releasing singles and several albums . Two of the most significant were The Classic Della ( 1962 ) and Waltz with Me , Della ( 1963 ) , which broadened her fan base internationally . She recorded several jazz - focused albums , including Della Reese Live ( 1966 ) , On Strings of Blue ( 1967 ) and One of a Kind ( 1978 ) . She also performed in Las Vegas for nine years and toured across the country . Reese continued to record albums in the following decades , receiving two more Grammy nominations in the gospel category for the album Della Reese and Brilliance ( 1991 ) and for the live recorded album , My Soul Feels Better Right Now ( 1999 ) . Motown singer Martha Reeves cites Reese as a major influence and says she named her group The Vandellas after Van Dyke Street in Detroit and Della Reese . </P> <H2> Television and film career ( edit ) </H2> Reese appearing in a Kraft Foods commercial , 1977 . <P> In 1969 , Reese began a transition into acting work which would eventually lead to her highest profile . Her first attempt at television stardom was a talk show series , Della , which was cancelled after 197 episodes ( June 9 , 1969 -- March 13 , 1970 ) . In 1970 , Reese became the first black woman to guest host The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . She appeared in several TV movies and miniseries , was a regular on Chico and the Man and played the mother of B.A. Baracus in The A-Team episode `` Lease with an Option to Die '' . In 1991 , she starred opposite her old friend Redd Foxx in his final sitcom , The Royal Family , but his death halted production of the series for several months . Reese also did voice - over for the late 1980s Hanna - Barbera animated series A Pup Named Scooby - Doo on ABC . In 1989 , she starred alongside Eddie Murphy , Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in the film Harlem Nights , in which she performed a fight scene with Eddie Murphy . Reese appeared as a panelist on several episodes of the popular television game show Match Game . </P> <H3> Television guest appearances ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reese has had a wide variety of guest - starring roles , beginning with an episode of The Mod Squad . This led to other roles in such series as : The Bold Ones : The New Doctors , Getting Together , Police Woman , Petrocelli , Joe Forrester , Police Story , The Rookies , McCloud , Sanford and Son with old friend Redd Foxx , Vega $ , Insight and two episodes of The Love Boat . She also had a recurring role on It Takes Two opposite Richard Crenna and Patty Duke , three episodes of Crazy Like a Fox , four episodes of Charlie & Co. opposite Flip Wilson , 227 with best friend Marla Gibbs , MacGyver , Night Court , Dream On , Designing Women , Picket Fences , Disney Channel 's That 's So Raven and The Young and the Restless . </P> <H3> Touched by an Angel ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After coping with the death of one of her best friends , Redd Foxx , in 1991 , she was reluctant to play an older female lead in the inspirational television drama Touched by an Angel , but went ahead and auditioned for the role of Tess . She wanted to have a one - shot agreement between CBS and producer Martha Williamson , but ordered more episodes . Reese was widely seen as a key component of the show 's success . Already starring on Touched by an Angel was the lesser - known Irish actress Roma Downey , who played the role of case worker Tess 's angel / employee , Monica . In numerous interviews , there was an on - and off - screen chemistry between both Reese and Downey . The character of Tess was the angelic supervisor who sent the other angels out on missions to help people redeem their lives and show them God 's love , while at the same time , she was sassy and had a no - nonsense attitude . The show often featured a climactic monologue delivered by the angel Monica in which she reveals herself as an angel to a human with the words : `` I am an angel sent by God to tell you that He loves you . '' The character of Tess was portrayed by Reese as down - to - earth , experienced and direct . Reese also sang the show 's theme song , `` Walk with You '' , and was featured prominently on the soundtrack album produced in conjunction with the show . </P> <P> During its first season in 1994 , many critics were skeptical about the show , it being the second overtly religious prime - time fantasy series , after Highway to Heaven . The show had a rocky start , low ratings and was cancelled 11 episodes into the first season . However , with the help of a massive letter - writing campaign , the show was resuscitated the following season and became a huge ratings winner for the next seven seasons . At the beginning of the fourth season in 1997 , Reese threatened to leave the show because she was making less than her co-stars ; CBS ended up raising her salary . Touched by an Angel was cancelled in 2003 , but it continued re-running heavily in syndication and on Ion Television ( formerly PAX - TV ) , The Hallmark Channel , Up , and later MeTV . Roma Downey said of her on - and off - screen relationship with Reese : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> She 's very wise . She 's very loving . She can be a little gruff at times , but she 's always adoring and adorable . I lost my mother when I was very young , and during my whole adolescence and into my twenties , I 'd been looking for a mother figure , and I really think I can say with absolute truth and sincerity that I feel that I finally found her in Della Reese . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Downey later also said : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I think I 'll just always remember the feel of her neck against my cheek when she hugs me and the love I know that she has for me and the love that I feel for her and the love that she has for God . To know Della is to know that she loves God . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2005 , Reese was honored by Oprah Winfrey at her Legends Ball ceremony , along with 25 other black women . On July 6 , 2011 , Reese celebrated her 80th birthday at the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles . In 2015 , a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her . Della Reese was the godmother of Roma Downey 's daughter Reilly Marie . Reese officiated at the marriage ceremony of Roma Downey and Mark Burnett in the absence of Downey 's late mother . </P> <H3> Family ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reese 's mother , Nellie Mitchelle Early , died in 1949 of an intracerebral hemorrhage . Reese 's father , Richard Early , died ten years later . Reese had an adoptive daughter whom she acquired from a family member unable to care for her , named Delorese Daniels Owens , in 1961 . Owens died on March 14 , 2002 . She passed away from complications stemming from pituitary disease . Reese said about the painful experience , sharing her frustration with the lack of awareness and knowledge of pituitary disorders : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> When it happened , I thought , ' It 's such an odd thing to die from , ' because pituitary problems are n't something you hear about . It makes it harder because you do n't understand what happened . It seemed so strange and hard to explain . It still is , to be honest . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Marriages ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1952 , Reese married factory worker Vermont Adolphus Bon Taliaferro , nineteen years her senior , and adopted the stage name Pat Ferro for a week , before introducing the stage name she used for the rest of her life -- though sources differ as to whether this was after the failure of the marriage , or simply a show - business decision . A second marriage ceremony , on December 28 , 1959 , to accountant Leroy Basil Gray , who had two children by a previous marriage , was kept secret for some time . This marriage either ended in divorce or was annulled on the basis that Gray 's previous divorce was invalid . Reese appears to have been briefly married to Mercer Ellington ( who was then her manager ) in 1961 , before this was annulled later that year due to Ellington 's Mexican divorce being ruled invalid.In 1983 , she married Franklin Thomas Lett , Jr. , a concert producer and writer . </P> <H3> Health ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1979 , after taping a guest spot for The Tonight Show , she suffered a near - fatal brain aneurysm , but made a full recovery after two surgeries by neurosurgeon Charles Drake at University Hospital in London , Ontario . In 2016 , shortly after her 85th birthday , Reese was said to be in poor health , and had undergone multiple surgeries . She further disclosed that she had neglected her health for years , which had contributed to her developing diabetes . After her last appearance on Signed , Sealed , Delivered , she had retired from acting . While Reese sometimes used a wheelchair , she avoided using one often , because it would make her condition worse . </P> <H3> Ministry ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1980s , Reese was ordained as a minister through the Christian New Thought branch known as Unity , after serving as the senior minister and founder of her own church , Understanding Principles for Better Living . The `` Up Church '' is under Universal Foundation for Better Living , a denomination of Christian New Thought founded by Rev. Johnnie Colemon , a close friend of Rev. Reese - Lett . As of 2009 , they meet at First Lutheran Church in Inglewood , California . In her ministerial work , she was known as the Rev. Dr. Della Reese Lett . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> <P> Reese died on November 19 , 2017 , at her Los Angeles , California , home at the age of 86 . No cause was given , although she had suffered from Type 2 - diabetes. . Her representative Lynda Blensky told USA Today , `` We lost a magnificent woman who was a trailblazer in many ways . '' </P> <P> Longtime friends Roma Downey ( with whom she worked on Touched by an Angel ) and Jackee Harry ( with whom she worked on 227 and The Royal Family ) reflected on her death . Downey said , `` On behalf of her husband , Franklin Lett , and all her friends and family , I share with you the news that our beloved Della Reese has passed away peacefully at her California home last evening surrounded by love , '' She then said : `` She was an incredible wife , mother , grandmother , friend , and pastor , as well as an award - winning actress and singer . Through her life and work , she touched and inspired the lives of millions of people . She was a mother to me and I had the privilege of working with her side by side for so many years on Touched by an Angel . I know heaven has a brand new angel this day . Della Reese will be forever in our hearts . Rest In Peace , sweet angel . We love you . '' </P> <P> Harry tweeted , `` I am completely devastated by the loss of Della Reese . She was a great co-star , sparring partner , drinking buddy , and friend . She taught me the power of prayer and the importance of humility . I 'll be forever grateful to call her my friend .
