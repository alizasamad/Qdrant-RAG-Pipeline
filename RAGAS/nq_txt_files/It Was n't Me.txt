The song features vocals from English - Jamaican singer Rikrok . </P> <P> The lyrics of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend caught him having sex with another woman . His friend 's advice is to deny everything , despite clear evidence to the contrary , with the phrase `` It was n't me . '' </P> <P> `` It Was n't Me '' has been regarded as Shaggy 's breakthrough in the pop market , and is his highest - charting song to date , topping the charts in Australia , Austria , France , Ireland , the United States , the Netherlands , and the United Kingdom . It was the best - selling single of 2001 in the United Kingdom , selling over 1.15 million copies that year and over 1.42 million as of 2017 .

His friend 's advice is to deny everything , despite clear evidence to the contrary , with the phrase `` It was n't me . '' Ultimately , the narrator says that the advice `` makes no sense at all '' . The song was inspired by a bit called `` No Loyal Men , '' performed by Eddie Murphy in his 1987 comedy special Raw . In a 2016 interview , Shaggy acknowledged similarities with the War song `` Smile Happy '' . The connection is further supported by Liam Payne 's 2017 debut single `` Strip That Down '' , itself based on `` It Was n't Me '' , which credited both Shaggy ( as Orville Burrell ) and members of War as co-songwriters . </P> <P> The clean version of the song replaces the lyric `` Picture this : we were both butt - naked banging on the bathroom floor '' with `` Picture this : we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor '' and `` Saw me banging on the sofa '' with `` Saw me kissing on the sofa '' . `` It Was n't Me '' was originally never intended to be released as a single . </P> <P> Before the original version of Hot Shot was released in August 2000 , Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from `` a Napster - like MP3 site he wo n't name '' and discovered that `` It Was n't Me '' was `` the album 's standout cut . '' He played the song on American radio the next day , and in an interview , claimed , `` The phone lines lit up right away . Within a couple of days , it was our number - one requested song . '' The song was then released as the album 's first single in September 2000 , following its radio success . The song is written in the key of C , in the Mixolydian mode . </P> <P> The song was spoofed by Bob Rivers , as Shaggy One Handed , making a reference to the Scooby - Doo character , Shaggy Rogers . The video focused on him being caught masturbating ( about the girl next door ) by his mother . The song was also spoofed on Svengoolie . On The Chris Moyles Show , the song was used as a prank call with Shaggy trying to book a taxi , with the final line being `` Can you drop me off at The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 ? , 97 to 99 FM '' . </P> <H2> Chart performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` It Was n't Me '' was Shaggy 's first number - one hit in the United States . The song peaked at number two for two weeks from December 16 , 2000 to December 23 , 2000 . On December 30 , 2000 , it was bumped down one position to number three . It moved back up to the number two spot on January 4 , 2001 . </P> <P> The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on March 4 , 2001 , selling 345,000 copies , making the song a transatlantic chart - topper . It also reached number one in Australia on April 1 , 2001 . It is also the 11th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the United Kingdom , with sales of over 1.42 million as of September 2017 . </P> <P> As of August 2014 , it is the 49th best - selling single of the 21st century in France , with 399,500 units sold . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> The music video was directed by Stephen Scott . </P> <P> It starts out with Rikrok running to Shaggy 's mansion to explain to him what has just happened . Rikrok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got caught . Shaggy tells him to tell her that `` It was n't me . '' The video then cuts into a flashback to earlier that day . Rikrok has been caught sleeping with another woman , and his girlfriend is outside the apartment in her convertible when two women pull up next to her on their motorcycles ( sport bikes ) . </P> <P> Then , the three women go into the building . He then sneaks out the window , takes the motorcycle of one of his girlfriends accomplices and leaves . The women come out and the girlfriend and one of the accomplices get in the convertible and the other gets on her motorcycle and they chase after him . From his mansion , Shaggy , using his futuristic technology , tracks down where Rikrok is going and prepares an escape for him . Rikrok then gets on a bridge over the highway when the accomplice rode on the bridge in front of him . </P> <P> He then hits the brakes to stop while she stops her motorcycle . Rikrok then hears a noise behind him and it 's the other accomplices and the girlfriend driving the convertible on the other side of the bridge with the highway down below . An eighteen - wheeler drives by , and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message telling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of overhead and lands on the truck . He is then dropped off at Shaggy 's mansion , showing the same scene from the start of the video . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The lyrics of `` It Was n't Me '' inspired Slate writer Josh Levin to coin the term the `` Shaggy defense '' to describe R. Kelly 's defence at his child pornography trial stemming from the production of a sex tape : `` I predict that in the decades to come , law schools will teach this as the ' Shaggy defense ' . You allege that I was caught on camera , butt naked , banging on the log cabin floor ? It was n't me . '' </P> <P> Levin repeated the term on NPR . The term describes a strategy of flatly denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence against the defendant , no matter how overwhelming . R. Kelly was ultimately found not guilty on all charges . </P> <P> The song is referenced by Trevor Noah on an episode of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah when he covered the vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine , as Pence vehemently kept denying his running mate Donald Trump 's claims , despite the fact that the claims have been proved to be said by Trump on camera or through his Twitter account . </P> <H2> Track listings ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> UK </Li> </Ul> <P> CD Single </P> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Vocal 12 '' Mix ) -- 3 : 49 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit ) -- 8 : 07 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Enhanced Video ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> </Ol> <P> Cassette single </P> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' -- 3 : 47 </Li> </Ol> <Ul> <Li> U.S. </Li> </Ul> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' -- 3 : 47 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Squeaky Remix ) -- 4 : 25 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Instrumental ) -- 3 : 47 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Sports Remix ) -- 3 : 27 </Li> </Ol> <Ul> <Li> Australia </Li> </Ul> <Ol> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Radio Edit ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Vocal 12 '' Mix ) -- 3 : 49 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Pussy 2000 Club Mix Edit ) -- 8 : 07 </Li> <Li> `` Dance & Shout '' ( Dancehall Version ) -- 3 : 46 </Li> <Li> `` It Was n't Me '' ( Enhanced Video ) -- 3 : 43 </Li> </Ol> <H2> Charts and sales ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2000 -- 01 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( ARIA ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Austria ( Ö3 Austria Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Wallonia ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada ( Nielsen SoundScan ) </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Denmark ( Tracklisten ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Europe ( Eurochart Hot 100 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Finland ( Suomen virallinen lista ) </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> France ( SNEP ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Germany ( Official German Charts ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ireland ( IRMA ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Italy ( FIMI ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( Recorded Music NZ ) </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Norway ( VG -
