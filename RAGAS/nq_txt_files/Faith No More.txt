Before settling on their current name in 1982 , the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man . Bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest remaining members of the band , having been involved with Faith No More since its inception . The band underwent several lineup changes early in their career , along with some major changes later on . The current lineup of Faith No More consists of Gould , Bordin , keyboardist / rhythm guitarist Roddy Bottum , lead guitarist Jon Hudson and vocalist / lyricist Mike Patton . </P> <P> After releasing six studio albums , including their best - selling records The Real Thing ( 1989 ) and Angel Dust ( 1992 ) , Faith No More officially announced their breakup on April 20 , 1998 . They have since reunited , embarked on The Second Coming Tour from 2009 to 2012 , and released their seventh studio album , Sol Invictus , in May 2015 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early days ( 1979 -- 1984 ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself ( 1985 -- 1988 ) </Li> <Li> 1.3 Mike Patton joins and The Real Thing ( 1989 -- 1991 ) </Li> <Li> 1.4 Angel Dust ( 1992 -- 1994 ) </Li> <Li> 1.5 King for a Day ... , Album of the Year and break - up ( 1995 -- 1998 ) </Li> <Li> 1.6 Reformation ( 2009 -- 2012 ) </Li> <Li> 1.7 Sol Invictus and hiatus ( 2015 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Musical style and influences </Li> <Li> 3 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Concert tours </Li> <Li> 5 Members </Li> <Li> 6 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 7 Discography </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Notes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early days ( 1979 -- 1984 ) ( edit ) </H3> Vocalist Chuck Mosley joined Faith No More in 1983 , and during his five - year tenure with the band , he appeared on their first two studio albums . <P> Faith No More was originally formed as Sharp Young Men in 1979 by bassist Billy Gould , drummer Mike Bordin , vocalist Mike Morris , and keyboardist Wade Worthington . Mike Morris described the name as `` a piss - take on all the ' elegant ' groups at the time . '' Later on , Morris proposed the name Faith In No Man , but , eventually , the band settled on Bordin 's suggestion Faith No Man ( stylized as Faith . No Man ) . </P> The band 's classic logo , used on their 1985 debut We Care a Lot . It was originally designed by Billy Gould as an homage to the Symbol of Chaos . <P> They recorded `` Quiet in Heaven / Song of Liberty '' , released in 1983 . The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace 's parents ' garage , where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men , with Mike Morris , Billy Gould , Mike Bordin and Wade Worthington . Worthington left shortly thereafter . They changed their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single , which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace 's garage , and hired Roddy Bottum to replace Worthington . Bottum , Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More . They chose the name to accentuate the fact that `` The Man '' ( Mike Morris ) was `` No More '' . They did n't have any constant guitarists or vocalists until they eventually settled on Chuck Mosley in 1983 and later Jim Martin . </P> <H3> We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself ( 1985 -- 1988 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the name change , the band initially started recording We Care a Lot without backing from a record label and , after pooling their money , recorded five songs . This gained the attention of Ruth Schwartz , who was then forming the independent label Mordam Records , under which the band , after getting the necessary financial support , finished and released the album . It was the first official release for both the band and the label . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Why Do You Bother '' ( 1985 ) 30 second sample of the We Care a Lot song `` Why Do You Bother '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Problems playing this file ?

The label had recently been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records , ensuring a widespread release for the band 's following albums . Introduce Yourself was released in 1987 , and a revamped version of their debut album 's title track `` We Care a Lot '' saw minor success on MTV . Mosley 's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic , particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988 . Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage , the release party for the album Introduce Yourself -- during which he fell asleep on stage -- and one of Mosley 's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour . Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe . Billy Gould reflected `` There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal , and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs . It was just so far off the mark . The upshot was that I got up , walked out and quit the band . I Just said : ' I 'm done -- I ca n't take this any longer . It 's just so ridiculous ' . The same day , I talked to Bordin , and he said : ' Well , I still want to play with you ' . Bottum did the same thing . It was another one of these ' firing somebody without firing them ' scenarios . '' </P> Faith No More in a promotional photo for The Real Thing , c. 1989 - 1990 <H3> Mike Patton joins and the Real Thing ( 1989 -- 1991 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Chuck Mosley was replaced with singer Mike Patton in 1988 . Patton , who was singing with his high school band , Mr. Bungle , was recruited at Martin 's suggestion after he heard a demo of Mr. Bungle . According to Patton , he first met the band during a 1986 gig at `` a pizza parlour '' in his hometown of Eureka , California . Two weeks after joining Faith No More , he had written all the lyrics for the songs that would make up the Grammy award - nominated The Real Thing . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Epic '' ( 1989 ) 30 second sample from Faith No More 's `` Epic '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Problems playing this file ?

The music video for `` Epic '' received extensive airplay on MTV in 1990 , despite anger from animal rights activists for a slow motion shot of a fish flopping out of water . That same year , Faith No More performed at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards ( September 6 ) and on the 293rd episode of Saturday Night Live ( December 1 ) `` From Out of Nowhere '' and `` Falling to Pieces '' saw releases as singles , and a cover of Black Sabbath 's `` War Pigs '' was also produced for non-vinyl releases . In 1990 , the band went on an extensive US tour , sending The Real Thing to Platinum status in Canada , the US , and South America . The album also had big sales numbers in Australia , UK , and the rest of Europe , pushing the total sales well above 4 million worldwide . </P> Vocalist Mike Patton joined Faith No More in 1988 , replacing Chuck Mosley . <P> In February 1991 , Faith No More released their only official live album , Live at the Brixton Academy . The album also included two previously unreleased studio tracks , `` The Grade '' and `` The Cowboy Song '' . That same year , the band contributed a track for the motion picture soundtrack to Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey with the song `` The Perfect Crime '' . Jim Martin also made a brief cameo in the film as `` Sir James Martin '' as the head of the `` Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center '' . Mike Patton 's original band Mr. Bungle would go on to sign with Slash / London 's parent label Warner Bros. Records in 1991 , following the worldwide success of The Real Thing . </P> <H3> Angel Dust ( 1992 -- 1994 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Faith No More displayed an even more experimental effort on their next album , Angel Dust . One critic writes that the album is `` one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label '' and another writes that the single `` ' A Small Victory ' , which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers ( ... ) reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions . '' </P> <P> Aside from `` A Small Victory '' ( which received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the MTV Video Music Awards ) , the tracks `` Midlife Crisis '' and `` Everything 's Ruined '' were also released as singles . The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy , and later pressings included a cover of The Commodores `` Easy '' , which in some parts of the world became the band 's biggest hit . Angel Dust , though not as successful as The Real Thing in the US , sold 665,000 copies there , and managed to outsell The Real Thing in many other countries . In Germany , the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies . The album also matched the sales of The Real Thing in Canada ( Platinum ) , Australia ( Gold ) , and surpassed it in the Netherlands , France , Russia , and the UK . Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Midlife Crisis '' ( 1992 ) 30 second sample from Faith No More 's `` MidLife Crisis '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan="2"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1993 , long - time guitarist Jim Martin left the band due to internal conflicts . He was reportedly unhappy with the band 's change in musical direction on Angel Dust , describing it as `` gay disco '' . According to Roddy Bottum , Martin was fired via fax . However , Martin himself states it was his decision to leave . Both Godflesh guitarist Justin Broadrick and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker were reportedly offered to join Faith No More after Martin 's departure , but declined to join . The position was filled by Mike Patton 's bandmate from Mr. Bungle , Trey Spruance , who left soon after recording 1995 's King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime and just before the band was to begin their world tour . Spruance was replaced by Dean Menta , the band 's keyboard tech . </P> <H3> King for a Day ... , album of the Year and break - up ( 1995 -- 1998 ) ( edit ) </H3> The alternate `` barking dog logo '' , based on the artwork for Faith No More 's 1995 album King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime <P> 1995 's King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime varies greatly from song to song in style ; post-hardcore / punk , country , jazz , bossa nova , thrash metal , gospel music , along with other signature FNM elements , are woven together throughout the album . Singles included `` Digging the Grave '' , `` Evidence '' , and `` Ricochet '' . The album featured Mr. Bungle 's Trey Spruance on guitar . The record went Gold in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , Netherlands and Germany , which gave the album a respectable sales figure of around 1.5 million copies ; this was significantly lower than sales of their previous albums . A 7 x 7 - inch box set of singles was released , which included the B - sides and some interviews between the songs . </P> <P> Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist , Jon Hudson , who was a former roommate of Billy Gould . The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries ( for example , in Germany , the album debuted at No. 2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months ) . In Australia , Album of the Year went to No. 1 and was certified Platinum . The album charted in many countries in Europe . To date , Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide . The singles `` Ashes to Ashes '' and `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' had minimal success ( notably , the music video for `` Last Cup of Sorrow '' , which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh , was inspired by the Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo ) . `` Stripsearch '' was released as a single in various countries ( excluding the US and UK ) . The album received largely negative reviews from US - based critics at the time . Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review `` ( They ) are floundering around desperately , groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant '' , while Pitchfork Media stated `` Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night 's used condom -- sure , the ride was fun while it lasted , but what remains is just plain icky . And you definitely do n't want it in your CD player .

Starting with a rumor posted to the Faith No More newsgroup alt. music. faith - no - more claiming Mike Patton had quit the band in favor of side projects , this rumor , although denied at the time , proved to be at least partly true . Faith No More played their last show in Lisbon , Portugal on April 7 , 1998 . The band cancelled their planned support tour for Aerosmith and on April 20 , Billy Gould released a statement by email and fax , saying `` ( T ) he decision among the members is mutual '' and `` the split will now enable each member to pursue his individual project ( s ) unhindered . '' The band `` thank ( ed ) all of those fans and associates that have stuck with and supported the band throughout its history . '' </P> <P> Immediately after the dissolution of Faith No More , the members went on to numerous different projects . Mike Patton notably co-founded the supergroups Fantômas and Tomahawk in 1998 - 99 , as well as continuing his original band Mr. Bungle , who were still signed with Warner Bros. Records . The sound of Tomahawk in particular has often been compared to Faith No More 's mid-late 1990s output . </P> <P> When Faith No More was brought up in a 1999 interview with The A.V. Club , Patton ( then fronting Mr. Bungle ) stated `` I 'm definitely glad it 's over : It was a great thing while it lasted , but it really had to end . I think if it had continued it would have gotten really ugly . No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that , but the music would have been substandard . So the line must be drawn there . '' In another interview from 2001 , he similarly stated that the band had broken up `` because we were starting to make bad music . '' However , Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton on the quality of the band 's late material , stating in 1998 `` However many records we sold or did n't , we maintained over a long period of time a high standard of music that we 're proud of , and we never sucked . Whatever shit that happened to us on the way , thank God it did n't get in the way of the music . '' </P> <H3> Reformation ( 2009 -- 2012 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for shows in the UK in the summer of 2009 were circulating in late November 2008 , but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould . He explained : `` If anything like this were to happen , it would have to come from the band , and I have n't spoken with any of them in over a year . So as far as I know , there is n't anything to talk about , and I 'm pretty sure that if you were to contact Patton , he would tell you the same thing . '' </P> <P> However , on February 24 , 2009 after months of speculation and rumors , Faith No More announced they would be reforming with a line - up identical to the Album of the Year era , embarking on a reunion tour called The Second Coming Tour . To coincide with the band 's reunion tour , Rhino released the sixth Faith No More compilation , The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection , a double album that includes their hit singles and b sides & rarities , in the UK on June 8 . Faith No More then played in major European festivals including Download Festival in the UK in June , Hurricane and Southside festivals in Germany , Greenfield Festival in Switzerland , Hove Festival in Norway and Roskilde Festival in Denmark , among other dates . The tour continued into 2010 with appearances at the Soundwave Festival in Australian cities throughout February and March . During their tour , the band added covers to their repertoire including `` Switch '' by Siouxsie and the Banshees . </P> <P> After an eleven - month hiatus , Faith No More played four shows in South America in November 2011 . On the first date ( November 8 , 2011 ) , the band played a `` mystery song , '' which led to speculation of new material . They played Sonisphere France on July 7 , 2012 . Following several more shows in Europe during 2012 , Faith No More became temporarily inactive again . Mike Patton spent 2013 touring with his reformed rock supergroup Tomahawk , while the band 's other members also pursued their own side projects . In July 2013 , Billy Gould confirmed that the band 's hiatus would not be permanent , saying `` We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that , and ready for the challenge . This is not the time ... yet .

'' On July 4 , Faith No More played their first show in two years at Hyde Park in London , supporting Black Sabbath . At that show , Faith No More debuted two new songs `` Motherfucker '' and `` Superhero '' ( also known by fans as `` Leader of Men '' ) . On August 20 , the band posted `` The Reunion Tour is over ; in 2015 things are going to change . '' These tweets led to speculation that the band was working on new material . On August 30 , Gould said that the band is `` considering doing something new '' , and may begin work on a new studio album at some point in the not - too - distant future , explaining , `` to do something creative would be a really good thing to do . '' On September 2 , Bill Gould revealed to Rolling Stone that the band had begun work on a new album . Faith No More headlined the final edition of Australia 's Soundwave in February and March 2015 . The band released their seventh studio album , Sol Invictus , in May 2015 . The songs on the album were influenced by The Cramps , Link Wray and Siouxsie and the Banshees . Speaking to Revolver , Gould described the song `` Cone of Shame '' as `` blues - based rock and roll '' . Describing the song `` Matador '' , he said : `` parts of it remind me of the first Siouxsie and the Banshees album . We used real pianos and that brings this organic quality to it to the music '' . The second single from the album , `` Superhero '' , was shared by the band on March 1 , 2015 . </P> <P> In a June 2016 interview , guitarist Jon Hudson stated that he has been `` working on a few ideas '' for the next Faith No More album , and added that `` it 's something that ( he ) wanted to focus on after the tour ended . '' When asked about the prospect of more music from Faith No More , Patton told Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald , `` I do n't know whether or not we 're going to attack it , but there is some stuff we wrote around the time of the last one and said , ' Why do n't we save this for the next record ? ' . So we 'll see . '' </P> <P> In August 2016 , the band performed two concerts with former lead singer Chuck Mosley to celebrate the reissue of their debut album We Care a Lot . The band was billed as `` Chuck Mosley & Friends '' for the two shows and featured the lineup of Mosley , Mike Bordin , Billy Gould , Jon Hudson and Roddy Bottum . </P> <P> In a September 2017 interview on Full Metal Jackie Radio , Patton revealed that Faith No More has been `` on an extended break . '' He added that he does not rule out more shows with the band , explaining , `` If something happens , it 'll happen organically and naturally . But I kind of do n't think it will . I kind of feel like we 've tipped the scales a little bit . But we 'll see . Who knows ? I 've learned my lesson not to say ' no . ' '' </P> <P> Former Faith No More singer Chuck Mosley died on November 9 , 2017 , due to `` the disease of addiction . '' He was 57 years old . </P> <H2> Musical style and influences ( edit ) </H2> <P> While Faith No More 's music is generally considered as alternative metal , experimental rock , and funk metal , as Faith No Man , their sound was described as post-punk . The band 's first single from 1983 , `` Quiet in Heaven / Song of Liberty '' , was labelled as a `` solid post-punk / pre-goth single . '' During their tenure with Chuck Mosley in the mid-1980s , Billy Gould stated the band were in a `` weird spot '' , as their eclectic sound did n't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era . Upon Mike Patton 's arrival in 1989 , the band began to expand their sound range even further , merging disparate genres such as synthpop , thrash metal and carousel music on The Real Thing . Rolling Stone states that during the 1990s , the band were `` too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind ( and ) too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle - draggers they spawned . '' Over the course of their career , they have experimented with heavy metal , funk , hip hop , progressive rock , alternative rock , hardcore punk , polka , easy listening , jazz , samba , ska , bossa nova , hard rock , pop , soul , gospel , and lounge music . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Ugly in the Morning '' ( 1995 ) 30 second sample of the King for a Day ...

See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Faith No More 's lyrics have been described as `` bizarrely humorous '' . When interviewed about his lyrics , Patton responded , `` I think that too many people think too much about my lyrics . I am more a person who works more with the sound of a word than with its meaning . Often I just choose the words because of the rhythm , not because of the meaning '' . </P> <P> Bordin acknowledged certain bands as early influences , including Killing Joke , PiL , Black Sabbath , and Theatre of Hate , and upon reforming , Faith No More returned to their early post-punk / goth influences on Sol Invictus . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> In a 2015 article by Artistdirect , Duff McKagan , Chino Moreno , Serj Tankian , Corey Taylor , Max Cavalera and Jonathan Davis praised the band for their significance and influence . Nirvana bassist , and co-founder , Krist Novoselic cited Faith No More as a band that `` paved the way for Nirvana '' in the late 1980s . Robert Plant , singer of Led Zeppelin , mentioned the then Chuck Mosley - led Faith No More as one of his current favorite bands in a 1988 interview with Rolling Stone . Plant and Faith No More subsequently toured together following The Real Thing 's release . Scott Ian of Anthrax has also named Faith No More as one of his favorite bands . </P> <P> Corey Taylor ( frontman for both Slipknot and Stone Sour ) told Loudwire in 2015 that if it was n't for Faith No More , he `` would n't be here today . '' While recovering from an attempted suicide at his grandmother 's house , he saw the band perform `` Epic '' live on the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the performance inspired him to begin writing and performing music again . </P> <P> They were voted No. 52 on VH1 's `` 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock '' . The band is credited for inventing the alternative metal genre which began in the 1980s and that fuses metal with other genres , including alternative rock . Tim Grierson of About.com said the band `` helped put alternative metal on the map . '' Faith No More has also been credited for influencing nu metal bands , such as Limp Bizkit , Korn , and Sevendust , primarily due to the popularity of `` Epic '' , and other early material that featured rap and rock crossovers . Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix , a self - confessed fan of the band , stated in a 2015 interview `` They fused some of that hip - hop and rock together . They were one of the earliest bands to do that , and definitely pioneers to a whole genre . If you listen to Korn , if you listen to how the bass and the drums lock up , it 's quite similar to how Faith No More was doing it in their early years . '' </P> <P> Faith No More have been covered by prominent metal acts such as 36 Crazyfists , Apocalyptica , Atreyu , Between the Buried and Me , Disturbed , Five Finger Death Punch , Helloween , Ill Niño , Korn , Machine Head , Papa Roach , Redemption , Revocation , Sentenced , Slaves on Dope and Trail of Tears . In 2002 , a tribute album titled Tribute of the Year ( a reference to Faith No More 's Album of the Year ) was released by Underground Inc . It featured 30 Faith No More songs covered by mostly unknown independent hardcore , industrial and alternative metal acts . </P> <P> The band and their 1989 single `` Epic '' have frequently been cited as an example of an ' 80s or ' 90s one - hit wonder . Flavorwire stated in 2014 `` Although the band always had a loyal fan base and Patton remains an indie hero , they only cracked the Billboard Hot 100 once , with Epic . '' Others have noted that after `` Epic '' 's success , the band still managed to remain highly popular in regions outside North America : including Australia , South America , Europe and the UK . The band 's original final record Album of the Year notably experienced high sales in countries such as Australia ( where it went platinum ) , New Zealand and Germany , while being deemed a critical and commercial failure in their native USA . </P> <H3> Relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Anthony Kiedis § Feud with Mike Patton <P> After the release of The Real Thing , Faith No More developed somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers , whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour . Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his `` style '' in the `` Epic '' music video . He told Kerrang ! magazine `` My drummer says he 's gon na kidnap ( Patton ) , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet , just so he 'll be forced to find a style of his own '' . In a separate interview , he clarified his comment , remarking `` I love The Real Thing , and I liked his vocals on that record . I mean , when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities , but when I saw that video it was like , ' Wait a second here , what the fuck ? . ' '' Roddy Bottum responded by saying `` To me , our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers . If you 're talking about long hair , rapping with his shirt off , then yeah , I can see similarities . But beyond that , I ca n't see any . I have n't talked to them since this whole thing started . We 're really good friends with that band and i 'd like to think they 're doing it ... like as a favour '' . Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990 , commenting that `` It just kind of came out of the blue . It does n't bother me a bit . I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth . I mean , if he 's gon na talk about me in interviews , that 's fine - it 's free press ! Either he 's feeling inadequate or old or I do n't know , but I have no reason to talk shit about him . '' Later in 2001 , Patton also theorized that `` I think Anthony , deep down , feels like I 'm a better dancer than he is . I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does . And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me . Maybe one day we 'll have a breakoff , just breakdance . '' </P> <P> Following a period of silence , the feud between Patton and Kiedis quickly escalated again in 1999 with Patton 's other band Mr. Bungle , culminating in an infamous Halloween show during 1999 in which Patton ( dressed as Kiedis ) and his bandmates parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers and their hit singles . The performance was in response to getting kicked off a series of lucrative festival gigs shared with Red Hot Chili Peppers , due to Kiedis 's staunch refusal to perform with Mike Patton . </P> <P> Despite this , other members of both groups appear to have remained on good terms since the initial controversy . Regarding the perceived conflict , Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated `` There was never any fight between us , that was a bunch of bullshit created by the media . I mean I think they 're a good band . Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer ( Patton ) , but it all means nothing to me . Those guys in the band are nice people and there 's no fight . '' At a 2014 show in Brooklyn , the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley - era song `` We Care a Lot '' . </P> <P> Fox News commentator Greg Gutfeld attracted media attention in 2016 when he stated `` You 're either a Faith No More fan , or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan . You can not love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis , because they are two different people . You have to love Mike Patton , you can not love Anthony Kiedis . So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe , because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe .
