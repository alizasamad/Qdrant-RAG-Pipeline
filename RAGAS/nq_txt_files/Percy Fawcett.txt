He received his education at Newton Abbot Proprietary College along with Bertram Fletcher Robinson . Percy Fawcett 's India - born father was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) . His elder brother Edward Douglas Fawcett ( 1866 -- 1960 ) was a mountain climber , Eastern occultist and author of philosophical books and popular adventure novels . </P> <P> Fawcett attended the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich as a cadet , being commissioned as a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery on 24 July 1886 . On 13 January 1896 he was appointed adjutant of the 1st Cornwall ( Duke of Cornwall 's ) Artillery Volunteers , and was promoted to captain on 15 June 1897 . He later served in Trincomalee , Ceylon , where he also met his future wife Nina Agnes Paterson , whom he married in January 1901 after having previously ended their engagement . They had two sons , Jack ( born 1903 ) and Brian ( 1906 -- 1984 ) , and one daughter , Joan ( 1910 -- 2005 ) . He joined the RGS himself in 1901 in order to study surveying and mapmaking . Later , he worked for the British Secret Service in North Africa while pursuing the surveyor 's craft . He served for the war office on Spike Island , County Cork from 1903 to 1906 , where he was promoted to major on 11 January 1905 . He became friends with authors H. Rider Haggard and Arthur Conan Doyle ; the latter used Fawcett 's Amazonian field reports as an inspiration for his novel The Lost World . </P> <H3> Early expeditions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Fawcett 's first expedition to South America was in 1906 ( being seconded for service there on 2 May ) when at the age of 39 he travelled to Brazil to map a jungle area at the border of Brazil and Bolivia at the behest of the Royal Geographical Society . The Society had been commissioned to map the area as a third party unbiased by local national interests . He arrived in La Paz , Bolivia in June . Whilst on the expedition in 1907 , Fawcett claimed to have seen and shot a 62 foot long giant anaconda , a claim for which he was ridiculed by scientists . He reported other mysterious animals unknown to zoology , such as a small cat - like dog about the size of a foxhound , which he claimed to have seen twice , or the giant Apazauca spider which was said to have poisoned a number of locals . </P> <P> Fawcett made seven expeditions between 1906 and 1924 . He was mostly amicable with the locals through gifts , patience and courteous behaviour . In 1908 , he traced the source of the Rio Verde ( Brazil ) and in 1910 made a journey to Heath River ( on the border between Peru and Bolivia ) to find its source , having retired from the British army on 19 January . After a 1913 expedition , he supposedly claimed to have seen dogs with double noses . These may have been Double - nosed Andean tiger hounds . </P> <P> Based on documentary research , Fawcett had by 1914 formulated ideas about a `` lost city '' he named `` Z '' somewhere in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil . He theorized that a complex civilization once existed in the Amazon region and that isolated ruins may have survived . Fawcett also found a document known as Manuscript 512 ( pt ) , written after explorations made in the sertão of the state of Bahia , and housed at the National Library of Rio de Janeiro . It is believed to be by Portuguese bandeirante João da Silva Guimarães ( pt ) , who wrote that in 1753 he 'd discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches , a statue , and a temple with hieroglyphics ; the city is described in great detail without providing a specific location . This city became a secondary destination for Fawcett , after `` Z '' . ( See Fawcett 's own book Exploration Fawcett . ) </P> <P> At the beginning of the First World War Fawcett returned to Britain to serve with the Army as a Reserve Officer in the Royal Artillery , volunteering for duty in Flanders , and commanding an artillery brigade despite the fact that he was nearly fifty years of age . He was promoted from major to lieutenant - colonel on 1 March 1918 , and received three mentions in despatches from Douglas Haig , in November 1916 , November 1917 , and November 1918 , and was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1917 . </P> <P> After the war Fawcett returned to Brazil to study local wildlife and archaeology . In 1920 , he made a solo attempt to search for `` Z '' , but ended after suffering from a fever and shooting his pack animal . </P> <H3> Final expedition ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1925 , with funding from a London - based group of financiers known as the Glove , Fawcett returned to Brazil with his eldest son Jack and Jack 's best and longtime friend , Raleigh Rimell , for an exploratory expedition to find `` Z '' . Fawcett left instructions stating that if the expedition did not return , no rescue expedition should be sent lest the rescuers suffer his fate . </P> <P> Fawcett was a man with years of experience travelling , and had brought equipment such as canned foods , powdered milk , guns , flares , a sextant , and a chronometer . His travel companions were both chosen for their health , ability and loyalty to each other ; Fawcett chose only two companions in order to travel lighter and with less notice to native tribes , as some were hostile towards outsiders . </P> <P> On 20 April 1925 his final expedition departed from Cuiabá . In addition to his two principal companions , Fawcett was accompanied by two Brazilian labourers , two horses , eight mules , and a pair of dogs . The last communication from the expedition was on 29 May 1925 when Fawcett wrote , in a letter to his wife delivered by a native runner , that he was ready to go into unexplored territory with only Jack and Raleigh . They were reported to be crossing the Upper Xingu , a southeastern tributary river of the River Amazon . The final letter , written from Dead Horse Camp , gave their location and was generally optimistic . </P> <P> Many people assumed that local Indians killed them , as several tribes were nearby at the time : the Kalapalos , the last tribe to have seen them , the Arumás , Suyás , and the Xavantes whose territory they were entering . The Kalapalo have an oral story of the arrival of three explorers which states that the three went east , and after five days the Kalapalo noticed that the group no longer made camp fires . The Kalapalo say that a very violent tribe most likely killed them . However , both of the younger men were lame and ill when last seen , and there is not any proof that they were murdered . It is plausible that they died of natural causes in the Brazilian jungle . </P> <P> In 1927 , a name - plate of Fawcett was found with an Indian tribe . In June 1933 , a theodolite compass belonging to Fawcett was found near the Baciary Indians of Mato Grosso by Colonel Aniceto Botelho . However , the name - plate was from Fawcett 's expedition five years earlier and had most likely been given as a gift to the chief of that Indian tribe . The compass was proved to have been left behind before he entered the jungle on his final journey . </P> Dead Horse Camp ( edit ) <P> Dead Horse Camp , or Fawcett 's camp , is one of the major camps that Fawcett made on his final journey . This encampment was his last known location . </P> <P> From Dead Horse Camp , Fawcett wrote to his wife about the hardships that he and his companions had faced , his coordinates , his doubts in Raleigh Rimmel , and of his plans for the near future . He concludes his message with , `` You need have no fear of any failure ... '' </P> <P> One question remaining about Dead Horse Camp concerns a discrepancy in the coordinates Fawcett gave for the camp . In the letter to his wife , he wrote : `` Here we are at Dead Horse Camp , latitude 11 degrees 43 ' South and longitude 54 degrees 35 ' West , the spot where my horse died in 1920 '' ( 11 ° 43 ′ S 54 ° 35 ′ W ﻿ / ﻿ 11.717 ° S 54.583 ° W ﻿ / - 11.717 ; - 54.583 ) . However , in a report to the North American Newspaper Alliance he gave the coordinates as 13 ° 43 ′ S 54 ° 35 ′ W ﻿ / ﻿ 13.717 ° S 54.583 ° W ﻿ / - 13.717 ; - 54.583 . </P> <P> The discrepancy may have been a typographical error . However , he may have intentionally concealed the location to prevent others from using his notes to find the lost city . It may have also been an attempt to dissuade any rescue attempts ; Fawcett had stated that if he disappeared , no rescue party should be sent because the danger was too great . </P> <H2> Posthumous controversy and speculations ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Rumours and unverified reports ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the ensuing decades , various groups mounted several rescue expeditions , without success . They heard only various rumours that could not be verified . In addition to reports that Fawcett had been killed by Indians or wild animals , there was a tale that Fawcett had lost his memory and lived out his life as the chief of a tribe of cannibals . </P> <P> While a fictitious tale estimated that 100 would - be-rescuers died on several expeditions attempting to discover Fawcett 's fate , the actual toll was only one - a sole man who ventured after him alone . One of the earliest expeditions was commanded by American explorer George Miller Dyott . In 1927 he claimed to have found evidence of Fawcett 's death at the hands of the Aloique Indians , but his story was unconvincing . From 1930 -- 31 , Aloha Wanderwell used her seaplane to try to land on the Amazon River in the Matto Grosso to find him . After an emergency landing and living with the Bororo Tribe for 6 weeks , Aloha and Walter Flew back to Brazil , with no luck . A 1951 expedition unearthed human bones that were found later to be unrelated to Fawcett or his companions . </P> <H3> Villas - Bôas story ( edit ) </H3> <P> Danish explorer Arne Falk - Rønne journeyed to the Mato Grosso during the 1960s . In a 1991 book , he wrote that he learned of Fawcett 's fate from Orlando Villas - Bôas , who had heard it from one of Fawcett 's murderers . Allegedly , Fawcett and his companions had a mishap on the river and lost most of the gifts they 'd brought along for the Indian tribes . Continuing without gifts was a serious breach of protocol ; since the expedition members were all more or less seriously ill at the time , the Kalapalo tribe they encountered decided to kill them . The bodies of Jack Fawcett and Raleigh Rimell were thrown into the river ; Colonel Fawcett , considered an old man and therefore distinguished , received a proper burial . Falk - Rønne visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported that one of the tribesmen confirmed Villas - Bôas 's story about how and why Fawcett had been killed . </P> <H3> Fawcett 's bones ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1951 , Orlando Villas - Bôas , activist for indigenous peoples , supposedly received the actual remaining skeletal bones of Fawcett and had them analysed scientifically . The analysis allegedly confirmed the bones to be Fawcett 's , but his son Brian Fawcett ( 1906 -- 1984 ) refused to accept this . Villas - Bôas claimed that Brian was too interested in making money from books about his father 's disappearance . Later scientific analysis confirmed that the bones were not Fawcett 's . As of 1965 , the bones reportedly rested in a box in the flat of one of the Villas - Bôas brothers in São Paulo . </P> <P> In 1998 , English explorer Benedict Allen went to talk to the Kalapalo Indians , said by Villas - Bôas to have confessed to having killed the three Fawcett expedition members . An elder of the Kalapalo , Vajuvi , claimed during a filmed BBC interview with Allen that the bones found by Villas - Bôas some 45 years before were not really Fawcett 's . Vajuvi also denied that his tribe had any part in the Fawcetts ' disappearance . No conclusive evidence supports either statement . </P> <H3> Russian documentary ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2003 , a Russian documentary film , `` Проклятье золота инков / Экспедиция Перси Фоссета в Амазонку '' ( The Curse of the Incas ' Gold / Expedition of Percy Fawcett to the Amazon ) , was released as a part of the television series `` Тайны века '' ( Mysteries of the Century ) . Among other things , the film emphasizes the recent expedition of Oleg Aliyev to the presumed approximate place of Fawcett 's last whereabouts and Aliyev 's findings , impressions and presumptions about Fawcett 's fate . </P> <H3> Commune in the jungle ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 21 March 2004 , the British newspaper The Observer reported that television director Misha Williams , who had studied Fawcett 's private papers , believed that Fawcett had not intended to return to Britain but rather meant to found a commune in the jungle based on theosophical principles and the worship of his son Jack . Williams explained his research in some detail in the preface to his play AmaZonia , first performed in April 2004 . </P> <H3> Grann 's Lost city of Z ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Lost City of Z ( book ) <P> In 2005 , The New Yorker staff writer David Grann visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported that it had apparently preserved an oral history about Fawcett , among the first Europeans the tribe had ever seen . The oral account said that Fawcett and his party had stayed at their village and then left , heading eastward . The Kalapalos warned Fawcett and his companions that if they went that way they would be killed by the `` fierce Indians '' who occupied that territory , but Fawcett insisted on going . The Kalapalos observed smoke from the expedition 's campfire each evening for five days before it disappeared . The Kalapalos said they were sure the fierce Indians had killed them . The article also reports that a monumental civilisation known as Kuhikugu may have actually existed near where Fawcett was searching , as discovered recently by archaeologist Michael Heckenberger and others . Grann 's findings are further detailed in his book The Lost City of Z ( 2009 ) . </P> <H2> Works ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Fawcett , Percy and Brian Fawcett ( 1953 ) , Exploration Fawcett , Phoenix Press ( 2001 reprint ) , ISBN 1 - 84212 - 468 - 4 </Li> <Li> Fawcett , Percy and Brian Fawcett ( 1953 ) , Lost Trails , Lost Cities , Funk & Wagnalls ASIN B0007DNCV4 </Li> <Li> Fawcett , Brian ( 1958 ) , Ruins in the Sky , Hutchinson of London </Li> </Ul> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article appears to contain trivial , minor , or unrelated references to popular culture .
